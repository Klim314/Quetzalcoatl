TI  == lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens.  they are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by clinical laboratory standards institute and international dairy foundation. their use as probiotics for prevention of clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will  the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. they are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with l. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas l. rhamnosus and l. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

TI  == a decade of experience in primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection at a community hospital using the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+).
AB  == in august 2003, the 284-bed community hospital pierre-le gardeur (plgh) in quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the clostridium difficile nap1/027/bi strain. augmented standard preventive measures (spms) were not able to control this outbreak. it was decided in february 2004 to give to every adult  inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (bio-k+: lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. augmented spms were continued. the use of the probiotic in addition to spms was associated with  a marked reduction of c. difficile infection (cdi). during the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received bio-k+, and the cdi rate at plgh declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. additionally, 10-year data collected by the ministry of health in quebec comparing the cdi rate between quebec hospitals showed that cdi rates at plgh were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. blood cultures were monitored at plgh for lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic bio-k+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary cdi rate.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+): characterization, manufacture, mechanisms of action, and quality control of a specific probiotic combination for primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == a specific probiotic formulation composed of lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+) has been marketed in north america since 1996. the strains and the commercial products have been evaluated for safety, identity, gastrointestinal survival, and stability throughout shelf life. the capacity of both the fermented beverages and the capsules to reduce incidences of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection (cdi) has been demonstrated in human clinical trials. individual strains and the finished products have shown antimicrobial activity against c. difficile and toxin a/b neutralization capacity in vitro. the use of this specific probiotic formulation as part of a bundle of preventive measures to control cdi in healthcare settings is discussed.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile diarrhoea (cdd) in older patients. methods: pubmed, embase, central, cinahl, and  web of science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to may 2014. only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces, streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older  patients (age >/=65 years) were included. risk ratios (rrs) for aad and cdd relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. results: six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. only one trial showed that bacillus  licheniformis was effective for preventing aad in older patients. however, there  was no preventive effect for aad and cdd with lactobacillus acidophilus (florajen), lactobacillus casei shirota, saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum (cultech strains), and mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus cul60, cul21, bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20 and b. lactis cul34. conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of aad and cdd in older patients. however, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. to confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.

TI  == clinical characteristics of symptomatic clostridium difficile infection in children: conditions as infection risks and whether probiotics is effective.
AB  == purpose: this study investigated the clinical presentations of symptomatic clostridium difficile infection (cdi) in children. methods: we reviewed the medical records of 43 children aged <20 years who showed either positive c. difficile culture or c. difficile toxin test results between june 2010 and april  2014. results: of the 43 patients (mean age 6.7 years), 22 were boys. sixteen patients (37.2%) showed both positive c. difficile culture and toxin test results. seventeen out of 43 children (39.5%) had preexisting gastrointestinal diseases, and 26 children had other medical conditions that were risk factors for cdi. twenty-eight children had a history of antibiotic treatment for >3 days, and the most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin-clavulanate (35.7%). twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with cdi despite taking probiotic supplements, most commonly lactobacillus acidophilus (53.6%). the most common symptom was diarrhea (72.1%) at the time cdi was diagnosed. c. difficile was eradicated in 11 patients (25.6%) after treatment with oral metronidazole for 10-14 days, and in the two patients (4.6%) who required two courses of oral metronidazole. sixteen patients (37.2%) showed clinical improvement without any treatment. conclusion: this study showed the various clinical characteristics of  cdi in children and that preexisting clinical conditions favored the development  of cdi. in addition, cdi was found to occur in a number of patients even after probiotic prophylaxis given in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus modulates the virulence of clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, toxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract. this pathogen causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in animals and humans. antibiotic-associated diseases may be treated with probiotics, and interest is increasing in such uses of probiotics. this study investigated the effect of lactobacillus strains on the quorum-sensing signals and toxin production of c. difficile. in addition, an in vivo experiment was designed to assess whether lactobacillus acidophilus gp1b is able to control c. difficile-associated disease. autoinducer-2 activity was measured for c. difficile using the vibrio harveyi coupled bioluminescent assay. cell extract (10mug/ml) of l. acidophilus gp1b exhibited the highest inhibitory activity among 5 to 40mug/ml cell-extract concentrations. real-time pcr data indicated decreased transcriptional levels in  luxs, tcda, tcdb, and txer genes in the presence of 10mug/ml of cell extract of l. acidophilus gp1b. survival rates at 5d for mice given the pathogen alone with  l. acidophilus gp1b cell extract or l. acidophilus gp1b were 10, 70, and 80%, respectively. in addition, the lactic acid-produced l. acidophilus gp1b exhibits  an inhibitory effect against the growth of c. difficile. both the l. acidophilus  gp1b and gp1b cell extract have significant antipathogenic effects on c. difficile.

TI  == probiotics reduce symptoms of antibiotic use in a hospital setting: a randomized  dose response study.
AB  == probiotics are known to reduce antibiotic associated diarrhea (aad) and clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (cdad) risk in a strain-specific manner. the aim of this study was to determine the dose-response effect of a four strain probiotic combination (howaru((r)) restore) on the incidence of aad and cdad and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in adult in-patients requiring antibiotic therapy. patients (n=503) were randomized among three study groups: howaru((r)) restore probiotic 1.70x10(10) cfu (high-dose, n=168), howaru((r)) restore probiotic 4.17x10(9) cfu (low-dose, n=168), or placebo (n=167). subjects  were stratified by gender, age, and duration of antibiotic treatment. study products were administered daily up to 7 days after the final antibiotic dose. the primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of aad. secondary endpoints included incidence of cdad, diarrhea duration, stools per day, bloody stools, fever, abdominal cramping, and bloating. a significant dose-response effect on aad was observed with incidences of 12.5, 19.6, and 24.6% with high-dose, low-dose, and placebo, respectively (p=0.02). cdad was the same in both probiotic groups (1.8%) but different from the placebo group (4.8%; p=0.04). incidences of  fever, abdominal pain, and bloating were lower with increasing probiotic dose. the number of daily liquid stools and average duration of diarrhea decreased with higher probiotic dosage. the tested four strain probiotic combination appears to  lower the risk of aad, cdad, and gastrointestinal symptoms in a dose-dependent manner in adult in-patients.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == impact of adding prophylactic probiotics to a bundle of standard preventative measures for clostridium difficile infections: enhanced and sustained decrease in the incidence and severity of infection at a community hospital.
AB  == background: in 2003, hospitals in quebec, canada experienced an increase of nap1/027 clostridium difficile infections following antibiotic administration (cdiaa). at pierre-le gardeur hospital (plgh), the incidence increased from 10 to over 25 cases per 1000 patient admissions. methods: we report a quasi-experimental, prospective cohort study evaluating the effect on cdiaa of a  probiotic added to existing c. difficile infection (cdi) standard preventative measures (spm) in 31,832 hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. phase i (1580) measured the impact of spm alone. in phase ii, 50 to 60 x 10(9) cfu daily  dose of oral lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and l. casei lbc80r probiotic formula (bio-k+) was administered to all patients receiving antibiotics. phase iii included the same intervention after a move to a new hospital facility. phases ii and iii included 4968 patients. during phase iv, 25,284 patients were submitted to the same regimen but outcome data were compared to those of similar  hospitals in quebec. results: at the end of phase iii, cdiaa had decreased from more than 18 cases per 1000 patient admissions in phase i to less than 5 cases. reductions of cdi cases (73%) (p < 0.001) and severe cdi cases (76.4%) (p < 0.001) were observed. cdi recurrence rate was reduced by 39% (p < 0.001). during  the following 6 years, the cdi rate averaged 2.71 cases per 10,000 patient-days at plgh compared to 8.50 cases per 10,000 patient-days in equivalent hospitals located in quebec. study limitation: this study is not a randomized clinical trial; it is an open prospective study and should be treated as such. also, following phase ii, plgh moved into a new facility and this could have contributed to lower cdi. conclusions: specific probiotic product added to spm and antibiotic stewardship activities resulted in a further reduction in cdi rates and was shown to be safe.

TI  == [outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
AB  == introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of  stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful  therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.

TI  == is primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection possible with specific probiotics?
AB  == background: the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is highly controversial, particularly with regard to the prevention of recurrent cdi. we hypothesize that primary prevention of cdi among patients receiving antibiotics might be a more achievable goal for probiotics than prevention in patients with previous cdi where the host flora is  markedly altered. methods: we conducted a literature search for randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies of probiotic use among adults receiving antibiotics, in which cdi was one of the outcomes measured. in addition, we conducted meta-analyses of probiotics that were included in more than one randomized trial. results: eleven studies were identified; most were seriously underpowered to determine the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of cdi. two showed significantly lower rates of cdi among the probiotic recipients. a meta-analysis of three studies that used the probiotic combination lactobacillus  acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r and a combined analysis of those studies with four studies that used saccharomyces boulardii, showed lower cdi rates in recipients of probiotics compared with recipients of placebo (risk ratio=0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.79). conclusions: while potential flaws in study design were identified, a review of the available literature suggests that the primary prevention of cdi with specific probiotic agents may be achievable. additional studies of sufficient size and with rigorous design are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  == a meta-analysis of probiotic efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  == background: meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed. methods/principal findings: we included randomized controlled trials in humans that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile disease, antibiotic associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, or necrotizing enterocolitis. random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of treatment. probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (ci) 0.51-0.65). six  of the eight diseases: pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome,  helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile disease, and antibiotic associated diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. traveler's diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. of the 11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bifidobacterium infantis. across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and  treatment lengths. conclusions/significance: probiotics are generally beneficial  in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. efficacy was not observed for traveler's diarrhea or necrotizing enterocolitis or for the probiotic species l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, and b. infantis. when choosing to use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to  take into consideration.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == savings from the use of a probiotic formula in the prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == objective: antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) and particularly clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) are the most common causes of healthcare associated infectious diarrhea. a double-blind, dose response, placebo-controlled trial of the probiotic formula (bio-k+ lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r formula) for prophylaxis of aad and cdad was published in 2010. the bio-k+ lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r formula is a registered trademark of bio-k plus international inc. (laval, quebec, canada). results indicated that the incidence of aad and cdad were lower  for patients assigned to the probiotic formula compared with the placebo option.  the present study aims to estimate the savings in direct medical costs that might result from the use of two different doses of the probiotic formula vs placebo. methods: a cost-consequence analysis was conducted to compare the two doses of the probiotic formula compared to placebo. the analysis was based upon published  data and adjusted to the north american context. results: economic analyses showed that the use of the probiotic formula would result in estimated mean per patients savings of us$1968 for the single dose and us$2661 for the double dose compared with the placebo option if used an average of 13 days by all patients at risk of developing aad and cdad. limitations: several key parameters considered within the economic model were not captured within the gao et al. study. numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted to address this issue. conclusion: the use of the probiotic formula in prophylaxis of aad and cdad would lead to estimated savings in direct medical costs that would substantially offset its acquisition cost. treating 1000 hospitalized patients on antibiotics with the double dose of  the product compared to current practice would save a single payer system the sum of $2,661,218.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus acidophilus & epidermal growth factor on experimentally induced clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == background & objectives: clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad) remains  an important nosocomial ailment. antimicrobial therapy used for cdad gives inconsistent results. this experimental study was planned to investigate the beneficial effects of lactobacillus acidophilus and epidermal growth factor (egf) for cdad management. methods: among 10 groups of balb/c mice (6 in each), group 1 served as controls receiving no inoculum. animals in groups 2-10 received c. difficile, those in groups 3, 6 and 9 received l. acidophilus and those in groups 4, 7 and 10 received egf after c. difficile inoculation. animals in groups 5-7 were pre-treated with ampicillin and those in groups 8-10 with lansoprazole prior to c. difficile. the animals were killed and investigated for colonisation by c.  difficile and toxin production, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity and histopathology. results: colonisation by c. difficile was found to be significantly different (p<0.001) in the various groups. c. difficile toxin titres and mpo activity were significantly lower in animals given l. acidophilus  and egf after ampicillin (groups 6 and 7) and lansoprazole (groups 9 and 10). the severity of acute inflammation was also significantly less (p<0.05) in caecal and colonic segments of animals in groups 6 and 7 compared to those in group 5. although the severity of acute inflammation was less in the caecal and colonic segment of animals in groups 9 and 10, the reduction was not significant compared to group 8. interpretation & conclusions: our findings showed that the administration of l. acidophilus and egf reduced the severity of c. difficile infection in the experimental animals.

AB  == imbalance in the regulatory immune mechanisms that control intestinal cellular and bacterial homeostasis may lead to induction of the detrimental inflammatory signals characterized in humans as inflammatory bowel disease. induction of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., il-12) induced by dendritic cells (dcs) expressing pattern recognition receptors may skew naive t cells to t helper 1 polarization, which is strongly implicated in mucosal autoimmunity. recent studies show the ability of probiotic microbes to treat and prevent numerous intestinal disorders, including clostridium difficile-induced colitis. to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction and repression of intestinal inflammation, the phosphoglycerol transferase gene that plays a key role in lipoteichoic acid (lta) biosynthesis in lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (nck56) was deleted. the data show that the l. acidophilus lta-negative in lta (nck2025)  not only down-regulated il-12 and tnfalpha but also significantly enhanced il-10  in dcs and controlled the regulation of costimulatory dc functions, resulting in  their inability to induce cd4(+) t-cell activation. moreover, treatment of mice with nck2025 compared with nck56 significantly mitigated dextran sulfate sodium and cd4(+)cd45rb(high)t cell-induced colitis and effectively ameliorated dextran  sulfate sodium-established colitis through a mechanism that involves il-10 and cd4(+)foxp3(+) t regulatory cells to dampen exaggerated mucosal inflammation. directed alteration of cell surface components of l. acidophilus ncfm establishes a potential strategy for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal disorders.

TI  == probiotic cheese containing lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm(r) modifies subpopulations of fecal lactobacilli and clostridium difficile in the elderly.
AB  == aging is associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota and with immunosenescence. probiotics have the potential to modify a selected part of the  intestinal microbiota as well as improve immune functions and may, therefore, be  particularly beneficial to elderly consumers. in this randomized, controlled cross-over clinical trial, we assessed the effects of a probiotic cheese containing lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on the intestinal microbiota and fecal immune markers of 31 elderly volunteers and compared these effects with the administration of the same cheese without probiotics. the probiotic cheese was found to increase the number of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus ncfm in the feces, suggesting the survival of the strains during the gastrointestinal transit. importantly, probiotic cheese administration was associated with a trend towards lower counts of clostridium difficile in the  elderly, as compared with the run-in period with the plain cheese. the effect was statistically significant in the subpopulation of the elderly who harbored c. difficile at the start of the study. the probiotic cheese was not found to significantly alter the levels of the major microbial groups, suggesting that the microbial changes conferred by the probiotic cheese were limited to specific bacterial groups. despite that the administration of the probiotic cheese to the  study population has earlier been shown to significantly improve the innate immunity of the elders, we did not observe measurable changes in the fecal immune iga concentrations. no increase in fecal calprotectin and beta-defensin concentrations suggests that the probiotic treatment did not affect intestinal inflammatory markers. in conclusion, the administration of probiotic cheese containing l. rhamnosus hn001 and l. acidophilus ncfm, was associated with specific changes in the intestinal microbiota, mainly affecting specific subpopulations of intestinal lactobacilli and c. difficile, but did not have significant effects on the major microbial groups or the fecal immune markers.

TI  == dose-response efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formula of lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea prophylaxis in adult patients.
AB  == objectives: standard therapies for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) have limited efficacy. probiotic prophylaxis is a promising alternative for reduction of aad and cdad incidence. methods: in this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study, we randomized 255 adult inpatients to one of three groups: two probiotic capsules per day (pro-2, n=86), one probiotic capsule and one placebo capsule per day (pro-1, n=85), or two placebo capsules per day (n=84). each probiotic capsule contained 50 billion c.f.u. of live organisms (lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 +lactobacillus casei lbc80r bio-k+ cl1285). probiotic prophylaxis began within 36 h of initial antibiotic administration, continued for 5 days after the last antibiotic dose, and patients were followed for an additional 21 days. results: pro-2 (15.5%) had a lower aad incidence vs. pro-1 (28.2%). each probiotic group had a lower aad incidence vs. placebo (44.1%). in patients who acquired aad, pro-2 (2.8 days) and pro-1 (4.1 days) had  shorter symptom duration vs. placebo (6.4 days). similarly, pro-2 (1.2%) had a lower cdad incidence vs. pro-1 (9.4%). each treatment group had a lower cdad incidence vs. placebo (23.8%). gastrointestinal symptoms were less common in the  treatment groups vs. placebo and in pro-2 vs. pro-1. conclusions: the proprietary probiotic blend used in this study was well tolerated and effective for reducing  risk of aad and, in particular, cdad in hospitalized patients on antibiotics. a dose-ranging effect was shown with 100 billion c.f.u., yielding superior outcomes and fewer gastrointestinal events compared to 50 billion c.f.u. (clinicaltrials.gov number nct00958308).

TI  == effect of biotherapeutics on cyclosporin-induced clostridium difficile infection  in mice.
AB  == background and aim: immunosuppressive therapy may precipitate clostridium difficile associated disease (cdad). we evaluated the role of cyclosporin in the  development of cdad in the experimental mouse model and studied the effect of probiotic and epidermal growth factor (egf) as biotherapeutics measures. methods: balb/c mice (n = 24) were divided into four groups. group i animals not given any inoculum served as controls. animals in the remaining three groups (group ii, iii and iv) were given cyclosporin daily from days 1-7 followed by c. difficile inoculum on day 8. additionally, the animals received lactobacillus acidophilus (group iii) and egf (group iv) for one-week post c. difficile challenge. the animals were evaluated for colonization and toxin production by c. difficile, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity and histopathological changes. results: clostridium difficile was colonized and elaborated its toxins in animals receiving cyclosporin and c. difficile. mpo activity was significantly higher (p  < 0.05) and histopathological epithelial damage, cryptitis and acute inflammatory changes were seen in the cecum and colon. c. difficile count, toxins a and b titers and mpo activity were significantly lowered (p < 0.05) in animals receiving probiotic and egf. histopathologically, mucodepletion and inflammatory  infiltrate were decreased in the biotherapeutic receiving animals. conclusions: cyclosporin led to the development of mild to moderate cdad in animals. administration of biotherapeutics reduced the severity of cdad. future clinical trials are needed for further investigation of these potential biotherapeutic measures.

TI  == purification, characterisation and identification of acidocin lchv, an antimicrobial peptide produced by lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. er 317/402 strain narine.
AB  == in the last two decades, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been gaining attention as antimicrobial alternatives to chemical food preservatives and commonly used antibiotics. lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. er 317/402 strain narine produces a small amp with a molecular weight of 1.1kda, designated acidocin lchv. in this study, the amp was extremely heat stable (90min at 130 degrees c), was active over a wide ph range and was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin and proteinase k). acidocin lchv has a broad spectrum of activity both against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including several that are classified as especially dangerous infections by the world health organization as well as meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and clostridium difficile. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof/ms) was used to determine the molecular mass and sequence of the purified peptide. complete killing with immediate impact on cells was observed within a very short period of time (10min).

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == bacteriotherapy using fecal flora: toying with human motions.
AB  == the intestinal flora may play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain gastrointestinal (gi) diseases. components of bowel flora such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidus have long been used empirically as therapeutic agents for gi disorders. more complex combinations of probiotics for  therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire fecal flora. fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. this type of bacteriotherapy has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort for patients with severe clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. encouraging results have also been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation. the therapeutic use of fecal bacteriotherapy is reviewed here and possible mechanisms of action and potential applications explored. published reports on fecal bacteriotherapy are few in number, and detail the results of small uncontrolled open studies and case reports. nevertheless, given the promising clinical responses, formal research into fecal bacteriotherapy is now warranted.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == influence of anti-helicobacter triple-therapy with metronidazole, omeprazole and  clarithromycin on intestinal microflora.
AB  == background: proton pump inhibitor-based therapy including two antibiotics is the  treatment of choice for helicobacter pylori infection. oral antibiotic treatment  can lead to intestinal overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria. aim: to investigate the intestinal microflora before and at different times after h. pylori treatment with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole. methods: bacterial growth in faecal samples from 51 patients infected with h. pylori was determined qualitatively and quantitatively. during the same period of time, stool samples from 27 h. pylori-negative controls were taken and investigated at  the same intervals. results: the microflora of h. pylori-infected patients was different from that in h. pylori negative controls. it was characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus acidophilus. immediately after therapy there was an increased colonization with yeasts, while the growth of lactobacilli and other species was inhibited. clostridium difficile was cultured from three cases, but without clinical manifestations of pseudomembranous colitis. after 4 weeks of therapy, the microflora returned to normal and was not different from that of the h. pylori-negative control group. conclusions: in h. pylori-positive patients the intestinal flora is characterized by an increase in growth of acid-tolerant l. acidophilus. eradication therapy exerts only a short-term influence on intestinal flora, whereas in the long term, the intestinal microflora is restored to a pattern similar to that of the control group.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == inactivation of clostridium difficile cytotoxin by the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system.
AB  == the cytotoxin of clostridium difficile was examined for sensitivity to oxidant secretory products of neutrophils. exposure to myeloperoxidase, h2o2, and a halide resulted in loss of toxin activity measured by tissue-culture cytotoxicity. the peroxide requirement was provided by reagent h2o2, a peroxide-generating enzyme (glucose oxidase), or a peroxide-producing intestinal  microorganism, lactobacillus acidophilus. human neutrophils stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate caused similar toxin inactivation. in both the cell-free and the neutrophil systems, inactivation of toxin required halides and was abrogated  by azide, cyanide, or catalase. neutrophils from patients with lack of myeloperoxidase or failure to produce h2o2 were impaired in toxin inactivation unless myeloperoxidase or h2o2, respectively, was added. the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol enhanced toxin activity. these data suggest a similarity between c difficile cytotoxin and the classic thiol-activated cytolysins. moreover, they raise the possibility that neutrophils are involved in oxidative detoxification of microbial products.

AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
