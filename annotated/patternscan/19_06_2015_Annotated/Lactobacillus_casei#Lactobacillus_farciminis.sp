TI  == simplification of a complex microbial antilisterial consortium to evaluate the contribution of its flora in uncooked pressed cheese.
AB  == a complex microbial consortium derived from raw milk and composed of populations  classified in 4 groups (lactic acid bacteria (a), gram positive catalase positive bacteria (b), gram negative bacteria (c) and yeasts (d)) can contribute to the inhibition of listeria monocytogenes in the core of an uncooked pressed cheese. to identify what groups may be involved in the inhibition, the consortium was simplified by successively omitting one group at a time. pasteurized milk was inoculated with these more or less complex consortia and their effects on l. monocytogenes count, ph, acids and volatile compounds in the core of uncooked pressed cheese were evaluated. the growth of l. monocytogenes was the highest in  cheeses prepared with pasteurized milk and only st. thermophilus. inhibition in other cheeses was expressed by comparison with growth in these ones. all the consortia containing both lactic acid bacteria (group a) and gram positive catalase positive bacteria (group b)--abcd, abd, abc, ab--were more inhibitory than those containing lactic acid bacteria on its own (a) or associated only with yeasts (ad) or/and gram negative (adc). consortia without lactic acid bacteria were weakly inhibitory or had no effect. gram positive catalase positive bacteria alone were not inhibitory although most of the species became established in the  cheeses. the lactobacillus population (lb. casei, lb. plantarum, lb. curvatus and lb. farciminis) was predominant in cheeses (9 log cfu/g) with a higher count than leuconostoc (7 log cfu/g) and enterococcus (7 log cfu/g). lactobacillus counts were negatively correlated with those of l. monocytogenes (r=-0.84 at 18 days) and with the level of d-lactic acid. there was no correlation between l. monocytogenes and leuconostoc or enterococcus counts. complex consortium abcd and ab not only had a stronger inhibitory power in cheeses than consortium ad, they were also associated with the highest levels of l-lactic and acetic acids. all cheeses inoculated with lactic acid bacteria differed from those without by higher levels of ethyl formiate, pentane and alcohols (2-butanol, 2-pentanol), and lower levels of ketones (2-hexanone, 2,3-butanedione) and aldehydes (2-methyl-butanal). levels of 2-methyl-butanal, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol were higher in abcd and ab cheeses than in ad cheeses. beside their contribution to the inhibition, their effect on cheese flavour must be evaluated.

TI  == characterisation of lab in typical salento pecorino cheese.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the typical pecorino cheese of the salento area of italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. a preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. for the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16s rdna gene was employed in addition, restriction analysis of amplified rdna (ardra) and pcr and  aflp fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated upgma cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. the data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. the main identified strains were lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. sakei, l. pentosus, l. farciminis and leuconostoc mesenteroides.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria from chili bo, a malaysian food ingredient.
AB  == ninety-two strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from a malaysian food ingredient, chili bo, stored for up to 25 days at 28 degreesc with no benzoic acid (product a) or with 7,000 mg of benzoic acid kg-1 (product b). the strains were divided into eight groups by traditional phenotypic tests. a total of 43 strains were selected for comparison of their sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) whole-cell protein patterns with a sds-page database of lab. isolates from product a were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus farciminis, pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecalis, and weissella confusa. five strains belonging to clusters which could not be allocated to existing species by sds-page were further identified by 16s rrna sequence comparison. one strain was  distantly related to the lactobacillus casei/pediococcus group. two strains were  related to weissella at the genus or species level. two other strains did not belong to any previously described 16s rrna group of lab and occupied an intermediate position between the l. casei/pediococcus group and the weissella group and species of carnobacterium. the latter two strains belong to the cluster of lab that predominated in product b. the incidence of new species and subspecies of lab in chili bo indicate the high probability of isolation of new lab from certain southeast asian foods. none of the isolates exhibited bacteriocin activity against l. plantarum atcc 14917 and lmg 17682.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == structural similarity and distribution of small cryptic plasmids of lactobacillus curvatus and l. sake.
AB  == plasmid profiles of strains of lactobacillus curvatus and l. sake isolated from meat or sauerkraut were analysed to investigate plasmid homology and distribution in relation to the ecology of these organisms in fermenting foods. a hybridisation probe was constructed by cloning of plc2, a cryptic, 2.6-kbp plasmid from l. curvatus lth683, into the escherichia coli plasmid prv50. in southern hybridisations with the digoxygenine labeled plc2 probe, plc2-related small plasmids were frequently detected in meat-borne strains of l. casei subsp.  pseudoplantarum, l. curvatus, l. sake, l. alimentarius, l. farciminis and l. halotolerans and in l. curvatus and l. sake isolated from sauerkraut. among 27 lactobacillus type strains originally isolated from habitats other than meat this type of homology was detected only with plasmids of l. buchneri and l. mali. restriction-enzyme mapping of six small cryptic plasmids from l. curvatus and l.  sake revealed strong structural homology but no similarity to previously characterized plasmids of lactobacilli. the presence of a variable region in addition to a conserved one and the occurrence of deletions during cloning of plc2 suggest that vectors derived from these plasmids are likely to be structurally unstable.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.

TI  == radiation resistance of lactobacilli isolated from radurized meat relative to growth and environment.
AB  == of 113 lactobacilli isolated from radurized (5 kgy) minced meat, 7 lactobacillus  sake strains, 1 l. curvatus strain, and 1 l. farciminis strain were used for radiation resistance studies in a semisynthetic substrate (i.e., modified mrs broth). five reference lactobacillus spp., one staphylococcus aureus strain, and  one salmonella typhimurium strain were used for comparative purposes. all l. sake isolates exhibited the phenomenon of being more resistant to gamma-irradiation in the exponential (log) phase than in the stationary phase of their growth cycles by a factor of 28%. four references strains also exhibited this phenomenon, with  l. sake (dsm 20017) showing a 68% increase in resistance in the log phase over the stationary phase. this phenomenon was not common to all bacteria tested and is not common to all strains with high radiation resistance. four l. sake isolates and three reference strains were used in radiation sensitivity testing in a natural food system (i.e., meat). the bacteria were irradiated in minced meat and packaged under four different conditions (air, vacuum, co2, and n2). organisms exhibited the highest death rate (lowest d10 values [doses required to  reduce the logarithm of the bacterial population by 1] ) under co2 packaging conditions, but resistance to irradiation was increased under n2. the d10 values  of the isolates were generally greater than those of the reference strains. the d10 values were also higher (approximately two times) in meat than in semisynthetic growth medium.
