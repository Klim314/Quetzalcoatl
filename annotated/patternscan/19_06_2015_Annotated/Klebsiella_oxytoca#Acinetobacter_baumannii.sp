TI  == molecular characterization and in vitro susceptibilities of beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli, klebsiella species, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to cse1034 and other beta-lactams.
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among 663 clinical isolates obtained from various parts of india and to study the occurrence of different variants of esbls among these isolates. methods: phenotypic characterization and susceptibility studies were performed according to the methods described in clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. the occurrence of esbl variants was analyzed with pcr using the previously reported primers. results: among the six hundred sixty three isolates, the identified isolates were acinetobacter baumannii (72), escherichia coli (218), klebsiella pneumoniae (30), klebsiella oxytoca (63), pseudomonas aeruginosa (264) and staphylococcus aureus (16). pcr results revealed that approximately 89.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were positive for esbl followed by escherichia coli (85.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (76.6%), klebsiella oxytoca (73.0%), acinetobacter baumannii (72.2%) and staphylococcus aureus (31.2%). the overall prevalence of esbl was 82.5%. the presence of tem type esbls were the predominant (in 186 isolates), followed by shv (138), oxa (92), ctx-m (65), ampc (33), kpc (28) and blaz (5). of the drugs involved in the study, cse1034 was found to be the most efficacious against all of esbl positive clinical isolates showing susceptibility approximately 95.7% with minimal inhibitory concentration values between 0.125 and 8.000 mug/ml for all strains tested. the susceptibilities of penems (meropenem and imipenem and cilastatin) ranged between 83% and 93% for all the isolates. the susceptibilities of other drugs like piperacillin and tazobactam, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, cefoperazone and sulbactam were <45% for all the isolates. conclusions: results of the present study indicated that majority of the isolates was susceptible to cse1034 and it could be a potent antibacterial agent for the treatment of severe  bacterial infections caused by such organisms.

TI  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the multi-drug resistance-encoding incl/m plasmid pacm1.
AB  == the 89,977 bp nucleotide sequence of pacm1, isolated from a 1993 outbreak strain  of cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella oxytoca, has been completed and assigned genbank accession number kj541681. the plasmid has a single 31,842 bp mosaic multi-drug resistance-encoding (mdr) region comprising the mer resistance module  of tn1696, two integrons with a total of seven cassettes, one complete copy each  of is1r and is26, and the bla(shv-5)-carrying tn2003 (with defective is26 termini), all within a tn1721-like element inserted into the mucb gene of the incl/m plasmid backbone. the tn1721-tn1696 combination resembles sequence found in the chromosomal mdr islands of some acinetobacter baumannii isolates. among the completely sequenced incl/m resistance plasmids, the tn1721-based mdr region  is unique, but data from older studies suggest that this type of plasmid was widespread in the 1990s. since resistance gene dosage is affected by plasmid copy number (pcn), we used a relatively simple new "efficiency-corrected" qpcr assay to measure the pcn of pacm1. there are approximately three copies per chromosome  in an escherichia coli dh5alpha host, and two in the original klebsiella oxytoca  isolate. we could not find similar pcn data for other medically important plasmids for comparison. the study of this plasmid property and its effect on resistance levels should be facilitated in the future by the availability of qpcr instruments and complete genome sequences.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == rapid identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria with an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay.
AB  == rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically  ill patients. a novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well  as selected extended (esbl) and narrow spectrum (nsbl) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii/braakii, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. the assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. for these isolates, phenotypic identifications  and susceptibility tests were available. an independent detection of carbapenemase, esbl and nsbl genes was carried out by various external reference  laboratories using pcr methods. in direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. this included blavim (13 out of 13), blagim (2/2), blakpc (27/27), blandm (5/5), blaimp-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaoxa-23 (12/13), blaoxa-40-group (7/7), blaoxa-48-group (32/33), blaoxa-51 (1/1) and blaoxa-58 (1/1). furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaoxa-1 (16/16), blaoxa-2 (4/4), blaoxa-9 (33/33), oxa-10 (3/3), blaoxa-51 (25/25), blaoxa-58 (2/2), ctx-m1/m15 (17/17) and blavim (1/1)]. in direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by vitek or  maldi-tof systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), enterobacter spec. (5/5), escherichia coli (4/4), klebsiella pneumoniae  (62/63), klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), citrobacter freundii (1/1) and citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. this assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == efficacy of surface disinfectant cleaners against emerging highly resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: worldwide, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a clinical problem. surface disinfectant cleaners (sdcs) that are effective against these bacteria are needed for use in high risk areas around patients and on multi-touch surfaces. we determined the efficacy of several sdcs  against clinically relevant bacterial species with and without common types of multidrug resistance. methods: bacteria species used were atcc strains; clinical  isolates classified as antibiotic-susceptible; and multi-resistant clinical isolates from klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens  (all oxa-48 and kpc-2); acinetobacter baumannii (oxa-23); pseudomonas aeruginosa  (vim-1); and achromobacter xylosoxidans (atcc strain). experiments were carried out according to en 13727:2012 in quadruplicate under dirty conditions. the five  evaluated sdcs were based on alcohol and an amphoteric substance (aas), an oxygen-releaser (or), surface-active substances (sas), or surface-active-substances plus aldehydes (sasa; two formulations). bactericidal concentrations of sdcs were determined at two different contact times. efficacy was defined as a log10 >/= 5 reduction in bacterial cell count. results: sdcs based on aas, or, and sas were effective against all six species irrespective of  the degree of multi-resistance. the sasa formulations were effective against the  bacteria irrespective of degree of multi-resistance except for one of the four p. aeruginosa isolates (vim-1). we found no general correlation between sdc efficacy and degree of antibiotic resistance. conclusions: sdcs were generally effective against gram-negative bacteria with and without multidrug resistance. sdcs are therefore suitable for surface disinfection in the immediate proximity of patients. single bacterial isolates, however, might have reduced susceptibility to selected biocidal agents.

TI  == impact of reclaimed water irrigation on antibiotic resistance in public parks, beijing, china.
AB  == the abundance and distribution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (args) in soils from six parks using reclaimed water in beijing, china, were characterized. three classes of commonly used antibiotics (tetracycles, quinolones, and sulfonamides) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). the highest concentrations of tetracyclines and quinolones were 145.2 mug kg(-1) and 79.2 mug kg(-1), respectively. detected tetg, tetw, suli, and sulii genes were quantified by quantitative pcr. args exhibited various abundances for different park soils. the integrase gene (inti1) as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer potential was also detected in high abundance, and had significant positive correlation with tetg, suli, and sulii genes, suggesting that inti1 may be involved in args dissemination. both sulii and inti1 clones had high homology with some classes of pathogenic bacteria, such as klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter baumannii, shigella flexneri, which could trigger potential public health concern.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing canward surveillance study. in total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. compared with other cephalosporins, including  ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with a mic(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (mic(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated mrsa (mic(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against staphylococcus  epidermidis; all isolates of mssa and mrsa tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=1 mug/ml). against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline mics (mic(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of s. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. all isolates of s. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). among gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (mic(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (mic(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across canada in 2009.

TI  == use of automated repetitive-sequence-based pcr for rapid laboratory confirmation  of nosocomial outbreaks.
AB  == objective: rapid and reliable diagnosis of genetic relatedness of clinical isolates in microbiologic laboratory is essential in case of nosocomial outbreak  investigation. most molecular techniques used to type microorganisms are technically demanding and time consuming. currently repetitive-sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) technique has been adapted to an automated format on the diversilab system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). aim of this study was to compare the performance of the diversilab system to that of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (pfge) in nosocomial outbreaks. methods: 122 clinical isolates (28 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 26 acinetobacter baumannii, 45 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca) were investigated. 70 isolates originated from six well-documented outbreaks, 52 were non-outbreak isolates. results: concordant results for identification of outbreak and non-outbreak mrsa, a. baumannii and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strains were achieved with both methods. in the outbreak of esbl-producing k. oxytoca automated rep-pcr was slightly more discriminatory than pfge. rep-pcr identified investigated esbl-producing k. oxytoca outbreak-strains as indistinguishable or closely related, showing similarity of >90%, while pfge identified these strains as indistinguishable. conclusion: automated rep-pcr assays on the diversilab system were used for mrsa, a. baumannii and for the first time esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and proved as  a rapid and reliable method for molecular analysis of nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == synergic degradation of phenanthrene by consortia of newly isolated bacterial strains.
AB  == three different bacteria capable of degrading phenanthrene were isolated from sludge of a pulp wastewater treatment plant and identified as acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. phenanthrene degradation efficiencies by different combinations (consortia) of these bacteria  were investigated and their population dynamics during phenanthrene degradation were monitored using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp). when a single microorganism was used, phenanthrene degradation efficiency was very low (48.0, 11.0, and 9.0% for a. baumannii, k. oxytoca, and s. maltophilia respectively, after 360 h cultivation). all consortia that included s. maltophilia degraded approximately 80.0% of phenanthrene and reduced lag time to 48 h compared to the 168 h of pure a. baumannii culture. ce-sscp analysis showed that s. maltophilia was the predominant species during phenanthrene degradation in the mixed culture. the results indicate that mixed cultures of microorganisms may effectively degrade target chemicals, even if the  microorganisms show low degradation activity in pure culture.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from severe infections in 1992: results of a french multicenter study. groupe d'etude d'infections a bacilles a gram negatif (geign)].
AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
