TI  - Interactions of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of S. Typhimurium. This was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. Subsequently, interactions between S. Typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. The exponential growth of S. Typhimurium was halted when the population of Escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. Furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of S. Typhimurium in the other compartment. The survival of S. Typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of S. Typhimurium was observed in these cultures. However, no effect on S. Typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions. The effect of human faecal samples on S. Typhimurium in a three-stage continuous culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than survival was affected under these conditions. S. Typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. Depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect S. Typhimurium.
TI  - Potential of goat probiotic to bind mutagens.
AB  - The mutagen binding ability of the goat probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39, and Bifidobacterium bifidum DDBA) was evaluated. The oral administration of these probiotics reduced fecal mutagens and intestinal cancer markers in goats. Secondly, the effects of probiotics against the mutagenesis induced by sodium azide (SA), and Benzopyrene (B[alpha]P) by performing the modified Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 was investigated. The capacity to bind benzopyrene and the stability of the bacterial-mutagen complex was analyzed by HPLC. The dismutagenic potential against both mutagens was proportional to probiotic concentration. Results showed that probiotic antimutagenic capacity against SA was ranging from 13 to 78%. The mixture of four goat probiotics (MGP) displayed higher antimutagenic activity against SA than any individual strains at the same cell concentration. This study shows that the highest diminution of mutagenicity in presence of B[alpha]P (74%) was observed in presence of MGP. The antimutagenic activity of nearly all the individual probiotic and the MGP were in concordance with the B[alpha]P binding determined by HPLC. According to our results, the B[alpha]P binding to probiotic was irreversible still after being washed with DMSO solution. The stability of the toxic compounds-bacterial cell binding is a key consideration when probiotic antimutagenic property is evaluated. MGP exhibits the ability to bind and detoxify potent mutagens, and this property can be useful in supplemented foods for goats since it can lead to the removal of potent mutagens and protect and enhance ruminal health and hence food safety of consumers.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of expression of virulence genes responsible for colonization and systemic spread of enteric pathogens using Bifidobacterium bifidum secreted molecules.
AB  - Enteric pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli require an initial indispensable step of attachment or invasion of enterocytes before they can produce systemic disease and translocate to their target organs. Prevention of either of these steps will result in an avirulent state and limit their pathogenicity. In vitro tests demonstrated that molecules secreted by Bifidobacterium bifidum interfere with both attachment and invasion. The main regulatory genes controlling the virulence factors essential for these pathogenicity steps were efficiently down-regulated when treated with chromatographically separated B. bifidum cell free fractions as measured by reporter constructs and confirmed by RT-PCR. Moreover, the ability of both pathogens to colonize eukaryotic cells was significantly reduced, and the capacity of Salmonella to survive and multiply within macrophages was also diminished upon treatment with these bioactive molecules. These results indicate that probiotic Bifidobacteria strains may represent an effective alternative approach to control food-borne enteric pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of mouse alpha-defensin cryptdin-4 predominantly affects noncommensal bacteria.
AB  - Mouse Paneth cell alpha-defensins, termed cryptdins, are secreted into the intestinal lumen, have microbicidal activity, and contribute to intestinal innate immunity. Among them, cryptdin-4 (Crp4) has the most potent microbicidal activity. In the intestinal lumen, commensal bacteria colonize and elicit beneficial effects in the host. However, the effects of Crp4 against commensal bacteria are poorly understood. Thus, we investigated the bactericidal activities of Crp4 against commensal bacteria compared to noncommensal bacteria. Oxidized Crp4 showed only minimal or no bactericidal activity against 8 out of 12 commensal bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus casei. We further addressed a role of the conserved disulfide bonds of Crp4 by analyzing reduced Crp4 (r-Crp4). r-Crp4 demonstrated significantly greater bactericidal activities against 7 of 12 commensal bacteria than did oxidized Crp4. Oxidized Crp4 and r-Crp4 elicited equivalently potent bactericidal activities against 11 of the 11 noncommensal bacteria tested, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,and against 5 of 12 commensal bacteria. Furthermore, when r-Crp4 was exposed to a processing enzyme of cryptdins, i.e. MMP-7, r-Crp4 was degraded and the bactericidal activities disappeared. These findings suggest that Crp4 has selective bactericidal activities against intestinal microbiota and that the activities are dependent on the disulfide bonds.
TI  - Purified galactooligosaccharide, derived from a mixture produced by the enzymic activity of Bifidobacterium bifidum, reduces Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium adhesion and invasion in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The prebiotic Bimuno((R)) is a mixture containing galactooligosaccharides (GOSs), produced by the galactosyltransferase activity of Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB 41171 using lactose as the substrate. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrating the efficacy of Bimuno((R)) in reducing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) colonization did not ascertain whether or not the protective effects could be attributed to the prebiotic component GOS. Here we wished to test the hypothesis that GOS, derived from Bimuno((R)), may confer the direct anti-invasive and protective effects of Bimuno((R)). In this study the efficacy of Bimuno((R)), a basal solution of Bimuno((R)) without GOS [which contained glucose, galactose, lactose, maltodextrin and gum arabic in the same relative proportions (w/w) as they are found in Bimuno((R))] and purified GOS to reduce S. Typhimurium adhesion and invasion was assessed using a series of in vitro and in vivo models. The novel use of three dimensionally cultured HT-29-16E cells to study prebiotics in vitro demonstrated that the presence of approximately 5 mg Bimuno((R)) ml(-1) or approximately 2.5 mg GOS ml(-1) significantly reduced the invasion of S. Typhimurium (SL1344nal(r)) (P<0.0001). Furthermore, approximately 2.5 mg GOS ml(-1) significantly reduced the adherence of S. Typhimurium (SL1344nal(r)) (P<0.0001). It was demonstrated that cells produced using this system formed multi-layered aggregates of cells that displayed excellent formation of brush borders and tight junctions. In the murine ligated ileal gut loops, the presence of Bimuno((R)) or GOS prevented the adherence or invasion of S. Typhimurium to enterocytes, and thus reduced its associated pathology. This protection appeared to correlate with significant reductions in the neutral and acidic mucins detected in goblet cells, possibly as a consequence of stimulating the cells to secrete the mucin into the lumen. In all assays, Bimuno((R)) without GOS conferred no such protection, indicating that the basal solution confers no protective effects against S. Typhimurium. Collectively, the studies presented here clearly indicate that the protective effects conferred by Bimuno((R)) can be attributed to GOS.
TI  - Dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells.
AB  - Dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of Bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Listeria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of B. longum (10(8) CFU/ml). B. longum, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that GAGs may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of B. longum.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Invasion of the gut by pathogenic Salmonella leads to production of IL-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. However, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress IL-8 production prevent tissue damage. We hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of IL-8 synthesis. Caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis W52, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactococcus lactis W58, Lactobacillus acidophilus W70, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, or Lactobacillus salivarius W24 or pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell for 1 hour. Cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of Salmonella as either co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by Salmonella (1 hour). The cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. IL-8 and Hsp70 were determined by ELISA and Western blot respectively. Both probiotics and Salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of IL-8 but probiotics induced far lower IL-8 levels than Salmonella. The Salmonella-induced IL-8 was significantly suppressed by B. infantis W52, L. casei W56 and L. lactis W58 at low numbers of Salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. The observed probiotic-mediated reduction in IL-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. In addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in Hsp70 expression while L. acidophilus W70, B. bifidum W23 and L. salivarius W24 induced a weak Hsp70 expression and could not suppress the Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis. We conclude that suppression of Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis by Caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of Hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via Hsp70 expression. This suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic Salmonella.
TI  - Probiotics down-regulate genes in Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium pathogenicity islands 1 and 2.
AB  - Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis relies mainly on the expression of genes of two pathogenicity islands, Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI1 and SPI2). Each island has its own pattern of expression and regulation. Success in suppression of the responsible key activator of each island would be an effective way of controlling Salmonella, especially with the emerging problem of antibiotic-resistant strains. Probiotics have been shown to inhibit several foodborne pathogens, and their mode of action may partly involve down-regulation of virulence genes. To investigate whether probiotics played a role in the regulation of the pathogenicity islands SPI1 and SPI2 in Salmonella, two reporter strains were constructed in which the general regulator of SPI1, hilA, and the response regulator of SPI2, ssrB, were fused with luxCDABE genes. These constructs were used to screen the effect of probiotics on the expression of each gene. Molecules secreted by Bifidobacterium bifidum were able to down-regulate both genes.
TI  - A mixture containing galactooligosaccharide, produced by the enzymic activity of  Bifidobacterium bifidum, reduces Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection in mice.
AB  - The prebiotic Bimuno is a mixture containing galactooligosaccharide, produced by  the galactosyltransferase activity of Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB 41171 in the presence of lactose. Previous studies have implicated prebiotics in reducing infections by enteric pathogens, thus it was hypothesized that Bimuno may confer some protection in the murine host from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection. In this study, infection caused by S. Typhimurium SL1344nal(r) in the presence or absence of Bimuno was assessed using tissue culture assays, a murine ligated ileal gut loop model and a murine oral challenge model. In tissue culture adherence and invasion assays with HT-29-16E cells, the presence of approximately 2 mM Bimuno significantly reduced the invasion of S. Typhimurium SL1344nal(r) (P<0.0001). In the murine ligated ileal gut loops, the presence of Bimuno prevented colonization and the associated pathology of S. Typhimurium. In the BALB/c mouse model, the oral delivery of Bimuno prior to challenge with S. Typhimurium resulted in significant reductions in colonization in the five organs sampled, with highly significant reductions being observed in the spleen at 72 and 96 h post-challenge (P=0.0002, <0.0001, respectively). Collectively, the results indicate that Bimuno significantly reduced the colonization and pathology associated with S. Typhimurium infection in a murine model system, possibly by reducing the invasion of the pathogen into host cells.
TI  - Secreted probiotic factors ameliorate enteropathogenic infection in zinc-deficient human Caco-2 and T84 cell lines.
AB  - Zinc deficiency enhances infectious diarrhea whereas probiotics may inhibit pathogen enterocyte invasion. The effect of probiotics on zinc-deficient versus normal human intestinal epithelium (Caco-2 and T-84) with regard to invasion and subsequent inflammatory response by Salmonella typhimurium was determined. Cells were infected with pathogens and preincubated with media conditioned by several lactobacilli or Bifidobacterium bifidum 12. Pathogen invasion was quantified, inflammation was determined by IL-8 secretion, and MAP kinase activation in the epithelium was analyzed. Probiotic inhibiting factors were partially characterized based on physicochemical properties. Zinc deficiency allowed for greater pathogen invasion and enhanced IL-8 secretion. Probiotic conditioned media reduced activation of proinflammatory signaling via the ERK and p38 pathway. Probiotic factors reverse increased susceptibility of zinc-deficient enterocytes to S. typhimurium invasion, suggesting an additive protective effect of probiotics in zinc deficiency. Probiotic conditioned media but not bacteria inhibited pathogen invasion and IL-8 production in zinc deficient enterocytes. Probiotic inhibitory factors are stable to treatment with proteases, deoxyribonucleases (DNAses), ribonucleases (RNAse), strong acid, and heat.
TI  - Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
TI  - A novel galactooligosaccharide mixture increases the bifidobacterial population numbers in a continuous in vitro fermentation system and in the proximal colonic contents of pigs in vivo.
AB  - Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that encourage proliferation of selected groups of the colonic microflora, thereby altering the composition toward a more beneficial community. In the present study, the prebiotic potential of a novel galactooligosaccharide (GOS) mixture, produced by the activity of galactosyltransferases from Bifidobacterium bifidum 41171 on lactose, was assessed in vitro and in a parallel continuous randomized pig trial. In situ fluorescent hybridization with 16S rRNA-targeted probes was used to investigate changes in total bacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides, and Clostridium histolyticum group in response to supplementing the novel GOS mixture. In a 3-stage continuous culture system, the bifidobacterial numbers for the first 2 vessels, which represented the proximal and traverse colon, increased (P < 0.05) after the addition of the oligosaccharide mixture. In addition, the oligosaccharide mixture strongly inhibited the attachment of enterohepatic Escherichia coli (P < 0.01) and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (P < 0.01) to HT29 cells. Addition of the novel mixture at 4% (wt:wt) to a commercial diet increased the density of bifidobacteria (P < 0.001) and the acetate concentration (P < 0.001), and decreased the pH (P < 0.001) compared with the control diet and the control diet supplemented with inulin, suggesting a great prebiotic potential for the novel oligosaccharide mixture.
TI  - In vitro growth responses of bifidobacteria and enteropathogens to bovine and human lactoferrin.
AB  - A series of in vitro experiments was performed to test the ability of bovine and  human lactoferrin to influence the growth of the gram-positive probiotic bacteria, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacteria, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium. None of the lactoferrin preparations stimulated the growth of the tested strains. However, iron-free apo-lactoferrin (bovine and human) and 66% iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin dramatically slowed the growth of E. coli O157:H7 in single culture experiments, while 98% iron-saturated preparations had no effect. In coculture experiments of B. infantis and E. coli, the iron-limited preparations of lactoferrin also slowed the growth of the latter without inhibiting the bifidobacteria. These results suggest that lactoferrin in iron-limited forms may have the potential to be combined with probiotic bacteria in biotherapeutic products, which could help balance human gut microflora and limit the overgrowth of certain enteric microorganisms.
TI  - [Effect of bifidobacteria on the anti-lysozyme activity of enterobacteria].
AB  - The influence of the subinhibitory concentrations of bifidobacterial exometabolites on the capacity for inactivating lysozyme in pathogenic and opportunistic enterobacteria was determined. The supernatant of B. bifidum 1 suppressed antilysozyme activity (ALA) in most Klebsiella strains and in some pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, but increased ALA in some E. coli of indigenous flora and failed to influence ALA in Salmonellae. The stimulating effect of the vital activity products of bifidobacteria with respect to the antilysozyme sign in some S. enteritidis isolates and diarrheagenic E. coli was found. These properties should be taken into consideration while selecting strains for the construction of probiotics.
TI  - Increased resistance of mice to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection by synbiotic administration of Bifidobacteria and transgalactosylated oligosaccharides.
AB  - AIMS: The anti-infectious activity of Bifidobacteria in combination with transgalactosylated oligosaccharides (TOS) against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT-2 in an opportunistic antibiotic-induced murine infection model in mice was examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: B. breve (strain Yakult) with natural resistance to streptomycin sulphate (SM, MIC: > 4 mg ml(-1)), when given daily at a dose of 108 cfu/mouse orally under SM treatment was constantly excreted at 10(10) cfu g(-1) faeces so long as SM was administered, even at 2 weeks after discontinuing administration of B. breve. Explosive intestinal growth and subsequent extra-intestinal translocation of orally infected LT-2 under SM treatment were inhibited by B. breve colonization, and this anti-infectious activity was strengthened by synbiotic administration of TOS with B. breve. Comparison of anti-Salmonella activity among several Bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance to SM revealed that strains such as B. bifidum ATCC 15696 and B. catenulatum ATCC 27539T conferred no activity, even when they reached high population levels similar those of effective strains such as strain Yakult and B. pseudocatenulatum DSM 20439. Both the increase in the concentration of organic acids and the lowered pH in the intestine due to bifidobacterial colonization correlated with the anti-infectious activity. Moreover, the crude cecal extract of B. breve-colonized mice exerted growth-inhibitory activity against LT-2 in vitro, whereas that of the ineffective B. bifidum-colonized cecum showed much lower activity. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria given exogenously together with TOS during antibiotic treatment prevents the antibiotic-induced disruption of colonization resistance to oral infection with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and the metabolic activity needed to produce organic acids and lower the intestinal pH is important in the anti-infectious activity of synbiotics against enteric infection with Salmonella. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results indicate that certain bifidobacteria together with prebiotics may be used for the prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Protective effect of bifidus milk on the experimental infection with Salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium in conventional and gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The ability of Bifidobacterium bifidum from a commercial bifidus milk to antagonize Salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium in vivo, and to reduce the pathological consequences for the host, was determined using conventional and gnotobiotic mice. Conventional animals received daily, by gavage, 0.1 ml bifidus milk containing about 10(9) cfu B. bifidum and germ-free animals received a single 0.1 ml dose. The conventional and gnotobiotic groups were challenged orally with 10(2) cfu of the pathogenic bacteria 5 and/or 10 d after the beginning of treatment. Control groups were treated with milk. Bifidus milk protected both animal models against the challenge with the pathogenic bacteria, as demonstrated by survival and histopathological data. However, to obtain the protective effect in gnotobiotic animals, the treatment had to be initiated 10 d before the challenge. In experimental and control gnotobiotic mice, Salm. enteritidis subsp. typhimurium became similarly established at levels ranging from 10(8) to 10(9) viable cells g-1 of faeces and remained at these high levels until the animals died or were sacrificed. It was concluded that the protection against Salm. enteritidis subsp. typhimurium observed in conventional and gnotobiotic mice treated with bifidus milk was not due to the reduction of the intestinal populations of the pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Evaluation of antinfective activity of an association bifidobacterium/lactobacillus in mouse intestine.
AB  - The present research aimed at studying the action of an association of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in controlling an experimental severe infection by Salmonella enteritidis administered in mouse per os. The behaviour of some parameters was undertaken, checking for the pH of intestinal content; the condition of the colonization in the intestinal wall by means of scanning electron microscopy and plates cultures; the presence of antibodies IgA in intestinal content; the index of mortality in the diversely treated animal's groups. The reported data show a string incidence of the administration of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in increasing the animal's resistance against the lethal infection.
