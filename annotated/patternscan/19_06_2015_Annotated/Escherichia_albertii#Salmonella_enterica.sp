TI  == a genomic island in salmonella enterica ssp. salamae provides new insights on the genealogy of the locus of enterocyte effacement.
AB  == the genomic island encoding the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) is an important virulence factor of the human pathogenic escherichia coli. lee typically encodes a type iii secretion system (t3ss) and secreted effectors capable of forming attaching and effacing lesions. although prominent in the pathogenic e. coli such as serotype o157:h7, lee has also been detected in citrobacter rodentium, e. albertii, and although not confirmed, it is likely to also be in shigella boydii. previous phylogenetic analysis of lee indicated the genomic island was evolving through stepwise acquisition of various components. this study describes a new lee region from two strains of salmonella enterica subspecies salamae serovar sofia along with a phylogenetic analysis of lee that provides new insights into the likely evolution of this genomic island. the salmonella lee contains 36 of the 41 genes typically observed in lee within a genomic island of 49, 371 bp that encodes a total of 54 genes. a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the entire t3ss and four t3ss genes (escf, escj, escn,  and escv) to elucidate the genealogy of lee. phylogenetic analysis inferred that  the previously known lee islands are members of a single lineage distinct from the new salmonella lee lineage. the previously known lineage of lee diverged between islands found in citrobacter and those in escherichia and shigella. although recombination and horizontal gene transfer are important factors in the  genealogy of most genomic islands, the phylogeny of the t3ss of lee can be interpreted with a bifurcating tree. it seems likely that the lee island entered  the enterobacteriaceae through horizontal gene transfer as a single unit, rather  than as separate subsections, which was then subjected to the forces of both mutational change and recombination.

TI  == phylogenetic incongruence arising from fragmented speciation in enteric bacteria.
AB  == evolutionary relationships among species are often assumed to be fundamentally unambiguous, where genes within a genome are thought to evolve in concert and phylogenetic incongruence between individual orthologs is attributed to idiosyncrasies in their evolution. we have identified substantial incongruence between the phylogenies of orthologous genes in escherichia, salmonella, and citrobacter, or e. coli, e. fergusonii, and e. albertii. the source of incongruence was inferred to be recombination, because individual genes support conflicting topology more robustly than expected from stochastic sequence homoplasies. clustering of phylogenetically informative sites on the genome indicated that the regions of recombination extended over several kilobases. analysis of phylogenetically distant taxa resulted in consensus among individual  gene phylogenies, suggesting that recombination is not ongoing; instead, conflicting relationships among genes in descendent taxa reflect recombination among their ancestors. incongruence could have resulted from random assortment of ancestral polymorphisms if species were instantly created from the division of a  recombining population. however, the estimated branch lengths in alternative phylogenies would require ancestral populations with far more diversity than is found in extant populations. rather, these and previous data collectively suggest that genome-wide recombination rates decreased gradually, with variation in rate  among loci, leading to pluralistic relationships among their descendent taxa.

TI  == fate of the h-ns-repressed bgl operon in evolution of escherichia coli.
AB  == in the enterobacterial species escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, expression of horizontally acquired genes with a higher than average at content is repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein h-ns. a classical example of an h-ns-repressed locus is the bgl (aryl-beta,d-glucoside) operon of e. coli. this locus is "cryptic," as no laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve repression of bgl by h-ns in e. coli k12. however, repression can be relieved by  spontaneous mutations. here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. typing of bgl in a representative collection of e. coli demonstrated that it evolved clonally and that it is present in strains of the phylogenetic groups a,  b1, and b2, while it is presumably replaced by a cluster of orfans in the phylogenetic group d. interestingly, the bgl operon is mutated in 20% of the strains of phylogenetic groups a and b1, suggesting erosion of bgl in these groups. however, bgl is functional in almost all b2 isolates and, in approximately 50% of them, it is weakly expressed at laboratory growth conditions. homologs of bgl genes exist in klebsiella, enterobacter, and erwinia  species and also in low gc-content gram-positive bacteria, while absent in e. albertii and salmonella sp. this suggests horizontal transfer of bgl genes to an  ancestral enterobacterium. conservation and weak expression of bgl in isolates of phylogenetic group b2 may indicate a functional role of bgl in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli.

TI  == evolutionary genetics of a new pathogenic escherichia species: escherichia albertii and related shigella boydii strains.
AB  == a bacterium originally described as hafnia alvei induces diarrhea in rabbits and  causes epithelial damage similar to the attachment and effacement associated with enteropathogenic escherichia coli. subsequent studies identified similar h. alvei-like strains that are positive for an intimin gene (eae) probe and, based on dna relatedness, are classified as a distinct escherichia species, escherichia albertii. we determined sequences for multiple housekeeping genes in five e. albertii strains and compared these sequences to those of strains representing the major groups of pathogenic e. coli and shigella. a comparison of 2,484 codon  positions in 14 genes revealed that e. albertii strains differ, on average, at approximately 7.4% of the nucleotide sites from pathogenic e. coli strains and at 15.7% from salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. interestingly, e. albertii strains were found to be closely related to strains of shigella boydii serotype 13 (shigella b13), a distant relative of e. coli representing a divergent lineage in the genus escherichia. analysis of homologues of intimin (eae) revealed that the central conserved domains are similar in e. albertii and shigella b13 and distinct from those of eae variants found in pathogenic e. coli. sequence analysis of the cytolethal distending toxin gene cluster (cdt) also disclosed three allelic groups corresponding to e. albertii, shigella b13, and a nontypeable isolate serologically related to s. boydii serotype 7. based on the synonymous substitution rate, the e. albertii-shigella b13 lineage is estimated to have split from an e. coli-like ancestor approximately 28 million years ago and formed a distinct evolutionary branch of enteric pathogens that has radiated  into groups with distinct virulence properties.
