TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == prevalent high-risk hpv infection and vaginal microbiota in nigerian women.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the association between high-risk human papillomavirus (hrhpv) and the vaginal microbiome. participants were recruited in nigeria between april and august 2012. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by deep sequencing of barcoded 16s rrna gene fragments (v4) on illumina miseq and hpv was identified using the roche linear array(r) hpv genotyping test. we used exact logistic regression models to evaluate the association between community state types (csts) of vaginal microbiota and hrhpv  infection, weighted unifrac distances to compare the vaginal microbiota of individuals with prevalent hrhpv to those without prevalent hrhpv infection, and  the linear discriminant analysis effect size (lefse) algorithm to characterize bacteria associated with prevalent hrhpv infection. we observed four csts: cst iv-b with a low relative abundance of lactobacillus spp. in 50% of participants;  cst iii (dominated by l. iners) in 39.2%; cst i (dominated by l. crispatus) in 7.9%; and cst vi (dominated by proteobacteria) in 2.9% of participants. lefse analysis suggested an association between prevalent hrhpv infection and a decreased abundance of lactobacillus sp. with increased abundance of anaerobes particularly of the genera prevotella and leptotrichia in hiv-negative women (p < 0.05). these results are hypothesis generating and further studies are required.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  == probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of lactobacillus salivarius ren (ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (dmh). the results indicated that oral administration of ren could effectively suppress dmh-induced colonic carcinogenesis. a significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 cfu/kg bodyweight per day. using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with dmh significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while ren counteracted these dmh-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by dmh and ren. injection of dmh significantly increased the amount of ruminococcus species (sp.) and clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the prevotella sp. administration of ren reduced the amount of ruminococcus sp., clostridiales bacteria, and bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of prevotella. real-time pcr results  were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. these findings suggested that ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. in conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  == chemical constituents and evaluation of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of kielmeyera coriacea mart. & zucc. essential oils.
AB  == many essential oils (eos) of different plant species possess interesting antimicrobial effects on buccal microorganisms and cytotoxic properties. eos of kielmeyera coriacea mart. & zucc. were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to  mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the eo from leaves is rich in sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. the three major compounds identified  were germacrene-d (24.2%), (e)-caryophyllene (15.5%), and bicyclogermacrene (11.6%). the inner bark eo is composed mainly of sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and  the major components are alpha-copaene (14.9%) and alpha-(e)-bergamotene (13.0%). the outer bark eo is composed mainly of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and long-chain  alkanes, and the major components are alpha-eudesmol (4.2%) and nonacosane (5.8%). the wood eo is mainly composed of long-chain alkanes and fatty acids, and the major components are nonacosane (9.7%) and palmitic acid (16.2%). the inner bark eo showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against the anaerobic bacteria prevotella nigrescens (minimum inhibitory concentration-mic of 50 microg ml(-1)). the outer bark and wood eos showed mics of 100 microg ml(-1) for all aerobic microorganisms tested. the eos presented low toxicity to vero cells. these results suggest that k. coriacea, a brazilian plant, provide initial evidence of a new and alternative source of substances with medicinal interest.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == exploring the sheep rumen microbiome for carbohydrate-active enzymes.
AB  == the rumen is a complex ecosystem enriched for microorganisms able to degrade biomass during the animal's digestion process. the recovery of new enzymes from naturally evolved biomass-degrading microbial communities is a promising strategy to overcome the inefficient enzymatic plant destruction in industrial production  of biofuels. in this context, this study aimed to describe the bacterial composition and functions in the sheep rumen microbiome, focusing on carbohydrate-active enzymes (cae). here, we used phylogenetic profiling analysis  (inventory of 16s rrna genes) combined with metagenomics to access the rumen microbiome of four sheep and explore its potential to identify fibrolytic enzymes. the bacterial community was dominated by bacteroidetes and firmicutes, followed by proteobacteria. as observed for other ruminants, prevotella was the dominant genus in the microbiome, comprising more than 30 % of the total bacterial community. multivariate analysis of the phylogenetic profiling data and chemical parameters showed a positive correlation between the abundance of prevotellaceae (bacteroidetes phylum) and organic matter degradability. a negative correlation was observed between succinivibrionaceae (proteobacteria phylum) and methane production. an average of 2 % of the shotgun metagenomic reads was assigned to putative cae when considering nine protein databases. in addition, assembled contigs allowed recognition of 67 putative partial cae (ncbi-refseq) representing 12 glycosyl hydrolase families (pfam database). overall, we identified a total of 28 lignocellulases, 22 amylases and 9 other putative cae, showing the sheep rumen microbiome as a promising source of new fibrolytic enzymes.

TI  == salivary microbiota associated with immunoglobulin a nephropathy.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan). fourteen healthy volunteers (hc) were used as control. compared to hc, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of igan patients. total bacteria from salivary samples of igan patients and hc subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene. paired t test showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (otu,  ace, chao1, and shannon index) between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients. the difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. compared to hc, the ratio between  firmicutes/proteobacteria markedly decreased in igan patients. gemella haemolysins, granulicatella adiacens, and veillonella parvula were positively associated (p < 0.05) with hc. within the phylum bacteroidetes, prevotella species (prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella pallens, and prevotella salivae) were the highest in hc. the only exception was for prevotella aurantiaca. compared to hc, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to pasteurellaceae family (e.g., haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in igan patients. fusobacteriaceae (fusobacterium) and corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients.

TI  == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial  communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries  (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root  caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and  patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium  acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated  with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI  == association between periodontal condition and subgingival microbiota in women during pregnancy: a longitudinal study.
AB  == objective: in this study, the gingival conditions and the quantitative detection  for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in pregnant women were determined. material  and methods: quantitative determinations of periodontal bacteria by using a sybr  green system in women during pregnancy were performed. women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and non-pregnant women were included in this study. a. actinomycetemcomitans was observed in high numbers in women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy with a significant difference (p<0.05). f. nucleatum and  p. intermedia were also observed in high levels. results and conclusion: our results show that pregnant women are more susceptible to gingivitis, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival biofilm might be taken into account for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == intraindividual variation in core microbiota in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
AB  == the oral microbiota change dramatically with each part of the oral cavity, even within the same mouth. nevertheless, the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis and periodontitis have been considered the same. to improve our  knowledge of the different communities of complex oral microbiota, we compared the microbial features between peri-implantitis and periodontitis in 20 patients  with both diseases. although the clinical symptoms of peri-implantitis were similar to those of periodontitis, the core microbiota of the diseases differed.  correlation analysis revealed the specific microbial co-occurrence patterns and found some of the species were associated with the clinical parameters in a disease-specific manner. the proportion of prevotella nigrescens was significantly higher in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis, while the proportions of peptostreptococcaceae sp. and desulfomicrobium orale were significantly higher in periodontitis than in peri-implantitis. the severity of the peri-implantitis was also species-associated, including with an uncultured treponema sp. that correlated to 4 clinical parameters. these results indicate that peri-implantitis and periodontitis are both polymicrobial infections with different causative pathogens. our study provides a framework for the ecologically different bacterial communities between peri-implantitis and periodontitis, and it will be useful for further studies to understand the complex microbiota and pathogenic mechanisms of oral polymicrobial diseases.

TI  == alcohol and tobacco consumption affects bacterial richness in oral cavity mucosa  biofilms.
AB  == background: today there are more than 2 billion alcohol users and about 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide. the chronic and heavy use of these two substances is at the heart of numerous diseases and may wreak havoc on the human  oral microbiome. this study delves into the changes that alcohol and tobacco may  cause on biofilms of the human oral microbiome. to do so, we used swabs to sample the oral biofilm of 22 subjects; including 9 control-individuals with no or very  low consumption of alcohol and no consumption of tobacco, 7 who were chronic and  heavy users of both substances and 6 active smokers that reported no significant  alcohol consumption. dna was extracted from swabs and the v1 region of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced using the ion torrent pgm platform, generating 3.7 million high quality reads. dna sequences were clustered and otus  were assigned using the arb silva database and qiime. results: we found no differences in species diversity and evenness among the groups. however, we found a significant decrease in species richness in only smokers and in smokers/drinkers when compared to controls. we found that neisseria abundance was significantly decreased in both groups when compared to controls. smokers had significant increases in prevotella and capnocytophaga and reductions in granulicatella, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus and gemella when compared to the two other groups. controls showed higher abundance of aggregibacter, whilst smokers/drinkers had lower abundances of fusobacteria. samples from only smokers  clustered closer together than to controls and smokers/drinkers, and also had a significant reduction in inter-group dissimilarity distances, indicating a more homogenous group than controls. conclusions: our results indicate that the continued use of tobacco or alcohol plus tobacco significantly reduces bacterial  richness, which apparently leads to a reduction in inter-group variability, turning the respective biofilms into a more homogenous microenvironment in terms  of bacterial community composition, with possible consequences for human oral diseases.

TI  == shifts in microbiota species and fermentation products in a dietary model enriched in fat and sucrose.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract harbours a 'superorganism' called the gut microbiota,  which is known to play a crucial role in the onset and development of diverse diseases. this internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (hfs) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of western societies. the aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male wistar rats fed a hfs diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. for this purpose, dna extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. short-chain fatty  acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. at the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria) and class level (erisypelotrichi, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidia and bacilli). interestingly, the class clostridia showed a significant decrease after hfs diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. of particular interest, clostridium cluster xiva species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (mitsuokella jalaludinii, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridium sp. fcb90-3, prevotella nanceiensis, clostridium fusiformis, clostridium sp. bnl1100 and eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. these results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able  to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years.  molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers,  were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious  lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

TI  == effects of stress hormones on the production of volatile sulfur compounds by periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of halitosis. thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of adrenaline (adr), noradrenaline (na) and cortisol (cort) on bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (vsc), the major gases responsible for bad breath. cultures of fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe), prevotella intermedia (pi) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were exposed to 50 microm adr, na and cort or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and 24 h. growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. portable gas chromatography was used to measure vsc concentrations. kruskal-wallis and the dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. for fn, adr, na and cort significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). all the substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (h2s) production (p<0.05). for pe, all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and  na significantly increased the h2s concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). in the pg and pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). in the pi cultures, adr, na and cort increased h2s (p<0.05). catecholamines and cortisol can interfere with growth and h2s production of sub-gingival species in vitro. this process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress and the production of vsc.

TI  == [effect of er:yag laser on the dynamic changes in subgingival flora in type 2 diabetic patients with periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to observe the changes in subgingival microflora before and after er:yag laser treatment on diabetic patients with periodontitis, and to compare with the subgingival microflora of chronic periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque of 13 pairs of teeth (26 sites) was selected from type 2 diabetic patients at pretreatment, one month post-treatment, and three months post-treatment. subgingival plaque was also obtained from 11 cases of moderate to severe chronic  periodontitis with similar severity of periodontitis. the dna of the subgingival  plaque samples was extracted. whole bacterial 16s rdna gene fragments separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. specific dna bands were then chosen for retrieval and sequencing. results: the gene sequencing results of the special dna bands of subgingival plaque samples show that the pathogenic bacteria of both diabetic periodontitis and simple chronic periodontitis were prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia, respectively. the composition of the subgingival microflora before and after laser treatment changed. some dna bands,  including that of tannerella forsythia, disappeared or weakened one month after treatment. a new strip appeared, which belonged to actinomyces sp. conclusion: the profiles of the subgingival microflora changed after treatment, and one month was indicated as an important stage. er:yag laser may have an important function  in delaying microflora recolonization.

TI  == bacteriological analysis of necrotic pulp and fistulae in primary teeth.
AB  == objectives: primary teeth work as guides for the eruption of permanent dentition, contribute for the development of the jaws, chewing process, preparing food for digestion, and nutrient assimilation. treatment of pulp necrosis in primary teeth is complex due to anatomical and physiological characteristics and high number of bacterial species present in endodontic infections. the bacterial presence alone  or in association in necrotic pulp and fistula samples from primary teeth of boys and girls was evaluated. material and methods: necrotic pulp (103) and fistula (7) samples from deciduous teeth with deep caries of 110 children were evaluated. bacterial morphotypes and species from all clinical samples were determined. results: a predominance of gram-positive cocci (81.8%) and gram-negative coccobacilli (49.1%) was observed. in 88 out of 103 pulp samples, a high prevalence of enterococcus spp. (50%), porphyromonas gingivalis (49%), fusobacterium nucleatum (25%) and prevotella nigrescens (11.4%) was observed. porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in three out of seven fistula samples, enterococcus spp. in two out of seven samples, and f. nucleatum, p. nigrescens and d. pneumosintes in one out of seven samples. conclusions: our results show that enterococcus spp. and p. gingivalis were prevalent in necrotic pulp from deciduous teeth in boys from 2 to 5 years old, and that care of the oral cavity of children up to five years of age is important.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == chicory (cichorium intybus l.) and cereals differently affect gut development in  broiler chickens and young pigs.
AB  == dietary fiber, resistant to host-mediated digestion in the small intestine due to lack of endogenous enzymes, impacts many facets of animal health and is associated with gut development especially in young monogastrics. furthermore, it can be used as in-feed antibiotic alternative. chicory (cichorium intybus l.) forage with high content of pectin (uronic acids as building blocks) is a novel class of dietary fiber that is chemically different from cereal grains (with high content of arabinoxylans). in the present study, we investigated effects of dietary inclusion of chicory forage on digestibility, gut morphology and microbiota in broilers and young pigs. in the chicken experiment, 160 1-d old broiler chicks were fed 3 nutritionally balanced diets for 30 d including a cereal-based diet and 2 diets with part of the cereals substituted with 60 and 120 g/kg chicory forage (cf60 and cf120), whereas in the pig experiment, 18 seven-wk old yorkshire pigs were fed 3 diets for 18 d including a cereal-based diet and 2 diets with 80 and 160 g/kg chicory forage inclusion (cf80 and cf160).  our results showed that young pigs were capable to utilize chicory forage well with higher total tract apparent digestibility (ttad) of all fiber fractions, particularly uronic acid, compared with the control (p < 0.01). in contrast, a decreased ttad of all fiber fractions was observed in chickens fed on diet cf120  (p < 0.05). moreover, diet induced changes in gut morphology were observed in the large intestine of chickens. the alteration of cecal mucosal thickness was further positively correlated with ttad of non-starch polysaccharides (nsp) and its constituent sugars (p < 0.05). in addition, in pigs, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis of intestinal microbiota revealed  substantial dietary effects (cereal control diet vs. chicory forage inclusion) on the relative abundance of 2 dominant bacterial phylotypes (prevotella sp. vs. roseburia sp.) respectively (p < 0.05). in conclusion, our data showed that chicory forage (cichorium intybus l.), a novel dietary fiber source in animal nutrition, have potential beneficial properties as fiber ingredient in diets for  both pigs and chickens.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == application of a packed bed reactor for the production of hydrogen from cheese whey permeate: effect of organic loading rate.
AB  == the production of h2 was studied using a packed bed reactor with polyurethane foam acting as support material. experiments were performed using mixed microflora under non sterile conditions. the system was initially operated with synthetic wastewater as the sole substrate. subsequently, cheese whey permeate was added to the system at varying organic loading rates (olr). the performance of the reactor was evaluated by applying a continuous decrease in olr. as a result, a significant decrease in h2 yields (hy) was observed with the decrease in olr from 18.8 to 6.3 g chemical oxygen demand (cod)/l d. microbial analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of non-hydrogen producers, sporolactobacillus sp. and prevotella, was the main reason for low hys obtained. this behavior indicates that the fermentation under non-sterile conditions was favored by high  concentrations of substrate by creating an adverse environment for nonhydrogen producer organisms.

TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == analysis of the airway microbiota of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by t-rflp and clone sequencing.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive, inflammatory lung  disease that affects a large number of patients and has significant impact. one hallmark of the disease is the presence of bacteria in the lower airways. objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the detailed structure of microbial communities found in the lungs of healthy individuals and patients with copd. nine copd patients as compared and 9 healthy individuals underwent flexible bronchoscopy and bal was performed. bacterial nucleic acids were subjected to terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and clone library analysis. overall, we identified 326 t-rflp band, 159 in patients and 167 in healthy controls. the results of the trf analysis correlated partly with the data obtained from clone sequencing. although the results of the sequencing showed high diversity, the genera prevotella, sphingomonas, pseudomonas, acinetobacter,  fusobacterium, megasphaera, veillonella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus constituted the major part of the core microbiome found in both groups. a trf band possibly representing pseudomonas sp. monoinfection was associated with a reduction of the microbial diversity. non-cultural methods reveal the complexity  of the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals and in patients with copd. alterations of the microbiome in pulmonary diseases are correlated with disease.

TI  == prevotella jejuni sp. nov., isolated from the small intestine of a child with coeliac disease.
AB  == five obligately anaerobic, gram-stain-negative, saccharolytic and proteolytic, non-spore-forming bacilli (strains cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t), cd3 : 33, cd3 : 32 and  cd3 : 34) are described. all five strains were isolated from the small intestine  of a female child with coeliac disease. cells of the five strains were short rods or coccoid cells with longer filamentous forms seen sporadically. the organisms produced acetic acid and succinic acid as major metabolic end products. phylogenetic analysis based on comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed close relationships between cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t) and cd3 : 33, between  cd3 : 32 and prevotella histicola ccug 55407(t), and between cd3 : 34 and prevotella melaninogenica ccug 4944b(t). strains cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t) and cd3 :  33 were clearly different from all recognized species within the genus prevotella and related most closely to but distinct from p. melaninogenica. based on 16s rrna, rna polymerase beta-subunit (rpob) and 60 kda chaperonin protein subunit (cpn60) gene sequencing, and phenotypic, chemical and biochemical properties, strains cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t) and cd3 : 33 are considered to represent a novel species within the genus prevotella, for which the name prevotella jejuni sp. nov. is proposed. strain cd3 : 28(t) ( = ccug 60371(t) = dsm 26989(t)) is the type strain of the proposed novel species. all five strains were able to form homologous aggregates, in which tube-like structures were connecting individual bacteria cells. the five strains were able to bind to human intestinal carcinoma  cell lines at 37 degrees c.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI  == differential activation of eosinophils by bacteria associated with asthma.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that there is a complex interaction between microbiota and various human diseases. some bacteria have been reported to be involved in the inception and progression of asthma, and others in the protection against asthma. we know very little about the mechanisms by which bacteria do harm or good with regard to asthma. this study investigated whether bacteria exert differential effects on the functions of eosinophils, major effector cells  in airway inflammation in asthma. methods: eosinophils were purified from healthy adult volunteers by percoll density gradient centrifugation and negative immunomagnetic bead selection using anti-cd16 microbeads. three kinds of heat-killed bacteria that have been implicated in asthma, namely staphylococcus aureus (sa), haemophilus influenzae (hi) and a prevotella sp. (ps), were tested for their effects on the secretion of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn), the generation of superoxides and the production of cytokines/chemokines. results: sa, but not hi or ps, induced significant edn release in a dose-dependent manner. superoxide generation was significantly enhanced by each of the bacterial species, but most strongly by sa, which induced significantly greater tnf-alpha production by eosinophils than either hi or ps. conversely, interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was more strongly induced by hi and ps than by sa. conclusions: bacteria exert differential effects on eosinophils. based on these results, sa may be involved in the exacerbation of, and hi and ps in the inhibition of, eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.

TI  == growth and fermentation of d-xylose by saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a novel d-xylose isomerase originating from the bacterium prevotella ruminicola tc2-24.
AB  == background: saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing d-xylose isomerase (xi) produce some of the highest reported ethanol yields from d-xylose. unfortunately, most bacterial xis that have been expressed in s. cerevisiae are either not functional, require additional strain modification, or have low affinity for d-xylose. this study analyzed several xis from rumen and intestinal microorganisms to identify enzymes with improved properties for engineering s. cerevisiae for d-xylose fermentation. results: four xis originating from rumen and intestinal bacteria were isolated and expressed in a s. cerevisiae cen.pk2-1c parental strain primed for d-xylose metabolism by over expression of its native d-xylulokinase. three of the xis were functional in s. cerevisiae, based on the strain's ability to grow in d-xylose medium. the most promising strain, expressing the xi mined from prevotella ruminicola tc2-24, was further adapted for aerobic and fermentative growth by serial transfers of d-xylose cultures under aerobic, and followed by microaerobic conditions. the evolved strain had a  specific growth rate of 0.23 h-1 on d-xylose medium, which is comparable to the best reported results for analogous s. cerevisiae strains including those expressing the piromyces sp. e2 xi. when used to ferment d-xylose, the adapted strain produced 13.6 g/l ethanol in 91 h with a metabolic yield of 83% of theoretical. from analysis of the p. ruminicola xi, it was determined the enzyme  possessed a vmax of 0.81 mumole/min/mg protein and a km of 34 mm. conclusion: this study identifies a new xylose isomerase from the rumen bacterium prevotella  ruminicola tc2-24 that has one of the highest affinities and specific activities  compared to other bacterial and fungal d-xylose isomerases expressed in yeast. when expressed in s. cerevisiae and used to ferment d-xylose, very high ethanol yield was obtained. this new xi should be a promising resource for constructing other d-xylose fermenting strains, including industrial yeast genetic backgrounds.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue  (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus  in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence  underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials,  antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and severity in a contemporary series of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == objective: to identify the causative pathogens and evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and virulence in a contemporary series of patients with fournier's gangrene. materials and methods: the medical records of  41 consecutive cases of fournier's gangrene were evaluated. the patient demographics, causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, and resistance patterns were assessed. the fournier's gangrene severity index and length of stay were analyzed statistically to determine any differences by causative pathogen. results: a total of 122 pathogens were cultured. the wound cultures were polymicrobial for 34 patients (83%). most common pathogens cultured were bacteroides sp (43.9%), escherichia coli (36.6%), and prevotella sp (34.1%). e coli was resistant to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 13.3%, and 40% of isolates respectively. the wound cultures were monomicrobial for 7 patients (17.0%). a monomicrobial isolate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was cultured that was susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was seen in providencia sp, klebsiella sp, e coli, and methicillin-resistant s aureus. resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin was seen in methicillin-resistant s aureus and e coli, respectively. no resistance to clindamycin was demonstrated. no statistically significant difference was detected between the fournier's gangrene severity index or length of stay and the causative pathogens. conclusion: fournier's gangrene remains a community-acquired polymicrobial infection, with anaerobic bacteria as the most common causative pathogens. candida and methicillin-resistant s aureus are emerging causative pathogens, but  methicillin-resistant s aureus remains sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. although resistance was demonstrated by some causative pathogens, together, the currently recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics adequately covered all pathogens. coverage with agents such as fluconazole, vancomycin, or piperacillin-tazobactam is indicated in patients at risk of fungal or hospital-acquired organisms.

TI  == microbial community diversity of organically rich cassava sago factory waste waters and their ability to use nitrate and n2o added as external n-sources for enhancing biomethanation and the purification efficiency.
AB  == water shortage necessitated south indian sago factory owners, extracting starch out of cassava tubers, to install biogas plants where a starch utilizing microbial community multiplies and reduces the biological oxygen demand (bod) of  the waste waters by presently about 30%. the purification efficiency of sago factory waste waters, rich in solid particles and having wide c/n ratios, around  250, through unstirred biogas plants needs to be improved. our approach was to apply instead of animal slurry nitrate (no3(-)) and nitrous oxide (n2o) as external n-sources anticipating a better n-distribution in the unstirred biogas plants. estimated cell numbers, bacterial community changes, on the basis of 16s  rrna gene clone libraries and changing co2-, ch4-, n2o releases due to the presence of nitrate or n2o suggest that acid tolerant lactobacillus spp. dominate the biogas plant inflows (ph 3.5). they were very less or not found in the outflows (ph 7.3). assumingly, the phyla bacteroidetes (prevotella spp.), proteobacteria (rhizobium spp., defluvibacter sp.), firmicutes (megasphaera spp., dialister spp., clostridium spp.) and synergistetes (thermanaerovibrio spp.), not-detectable in the biogas plant inflows, replaced them. anaerobes, about 400cellsml(-1) in the inflows, increased to about 10(6)cellsml(-1) in the outflows. the methane formation, as confirmed by the incubation experiments, suggests that methanogens must have been present among the anaerobes. in the biogas plant in- and outflows also about 300cellsml(-1) denitrifying bacteria and up to 10(4)cfu fungi were found. despite the low number of denitrifying bacteria  nitrate added to the biogas plant in- and outflows was widely consumed and added  n2o decreased considerably. thus, wide c/n ratios substrates like sago factory waste waters keep the n2o emissions low by using n2o either as electron acceptor  or by incorporating it into the growing biomass what needs to be confirmed. the biogas plant inflow samples have emitted tentatively more co2 and the outflow samples released more ch4.

AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of commercial alpha-gluco-oligosaccharide by faecal microbiota from lean and obese human subjects.
AB  == the fermentation selectivity of a commercial source of a-gluco-oligosaccharides (bioecolians; solabia) was investigated in vitro. fermentation by faecal bacteria from four lean and four obese healthy adults was determined in anaerobic, ph-controlled faecal batch cultures. inulin was used as a positive prebiotic control. samples were obtained at 0, 10, 24 and 36 h for bacterial enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa analyses. gas production during fermentation was investigated in non-ph-controlled batch cultures. a-gluco-oligosaccharides significantly increased the bifidobacterium sp. population compared with the control. other bacterial groups enumerated were unaffected with the exception of an increase in the bacteroides-prevotella group  and a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii on both a-gluco-oligosaccharides and inulin compared with baseline. an increase in acetate and propionate was seen on both substrates. the fermentation of a-gluco-oligosaccharides produced less total gas at a more gradual rate of production than inulin. generally, substrates fermented with the obese microbiota produced similar results to the lean fermentation regarding bacteriology and metabolic activity. no significant difference at baseline (0 h) was detected between the lean and obese individuals  in any of the faecal bacterial groups studied.

TI  == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients  (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction.  salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry.  clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found  in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the  reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy;  periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in  accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters,  it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == pattern of distribution of prevotella species/phylotypes associated with healthy  gingiva and periodontal disease.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to obtain diverse profiles of prevotella species associated with gingival sites in an isolated aboriginal and an urban community by phylogenetic analysis and to establish patterns of association of identified prevotella species in gingival sites. species/phylotypes identified from the phylogenetic analysis of near full-length bacteroidetes 16s rrna gene sequences cloned from subgingival plaque samples obtained from an aboriginal community were compared with those from an ethnically diverse urban metropolitan  population suffering from periodontal disease. specific primer sets were designed and validated for 22 distinct prevotella species from the 24 species/phylotypes identified from both populations. within the isolated aboriginal community, gingival sites in adults were colonised by a mean of 15 different prevotella species. prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, prevotella denticola and prevotella sp. strain p4p62 had the highest association with increasing probing depth in diseased sites (p < 0.05). p. intermedia and prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, the prevotella species significantly associated with increasing probing depth in diseased gingival sites and also strongly associated with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed significant correlation for co-colonisation (r = 0.6). prevotella sp. oral clone b31fd, showing strong association with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed no significant correlation for co-colonisation with any other prevotella species. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of prevotella species associated with gingival sites for the informative evaluation of the epidemiology of infection by this genus.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == quantification of cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in post-treatment apical periodontitis before and after chemo-mechanical preparation.
AB  == this clinical study was conducted to quantify cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in root canals with post-treatment apical periodontitis by correlating their levels with clinical features and to evaluate the effect of chemo-mechanical preparation (cmp) with 2 % chlorhexidine gel + 17 % edta on bacterial and endotoxin removal/elimination. moreover, target strict gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). fifteen teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis were sampled before (s1) and after (s2) cmp.  culture techniques determined the number of colony-forming units (cfu). pcr (16s  rdna) and limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. prevotella nigrescens (4/15), prevotella intermedia (2/15), and tannerella forsythia (2/15) were the most frequently detected species. endotoxin was recovered in 100 % of the samples. at s1, bacteria and endotoxin were detected at a median value of 5.14 x 10(3) cfu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively. higher levels of endotoxin were related to a larger size of radiolucent area (>5 mm) (p < 0.05). cmp was more effective in reducing bacteria (99.61 %) than endotoxin (60.6 %) (both p < 0.05). our findings indicated that the levels of endotoxin found in infected root canals were related to a larger size of radiolucent area in the periapical region. moreover, cmp was  effective in reducing both bacterial and endotoxin contents in post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == equine stomachs harbor an abundant and diverse mucosal microbiota.
AB  == little is known about the gastric mucosal microbiota in healthy horses, and its role in gastric disease has not been critically examined. the present study used  a combination of 16s rrna bacterial tag-encoded pyrosequencing (btefap) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) to characterize the composition and spatial distribution of selected gastric mucosal microbiota of healthy horses. biopsy specimens of the squamous, glandular, antral, and any ulcerated mucosa were obtained from 6 healthy horses by gastroscopy and from 3 horses immediately  postmortem. pyrosequencing was performed on biopsy specimens from 6 of the horses and yielded 53,920 reads in total, with 631 to 4,345 reads in each region per horse. the microbiome segregated into two distinct clusters comprised of horses that were stabled, fed hay, and sampled at postmortem (cluster 1) and horses that were pastured on grass, fed hay, and biopsied gastroscopically after a 12-h fast  (cluster 2). the types of bacteria obtained from different anatomic regions clustered by horse rather than region. the dominant bacteria in cluster 1 were firmicutes (>83% reads/sample), mainly streptococcus spp., lactobacillus spp. and, sarcina spp. cluster 2 was more diverse, with predominantly proteobacteria,  bacteroidetes, and firmicutes, consisting of actinobacillus spp. moraxella spp.,  prevotella spp., and porphyromonas spp. helicobacter sp. sequences were not identified in any of 53,920 reads. fish (n = 9) revealed bacteria throughout the  stomach in close apposition to the mucosa, with significantly more streptococcus  spp. present in the glandular region of the stomach. the equine stomach harbors an abundant and diverse mucosal microbiota that varies by individual.

TI  == longitudinal assessment of pigtailed macaque lower genital tract microbiota by pyrosequencing reveals dissimilarity to the genital microbiota of healthy humans.
AB  == vaginal bacterial communities play an important role in human health and have been shown to influence hiv infection. pigtailed macaques (macaca nemestrina) are used as an animal model of hiv vaginal infection of women. since the bacterial microbiota could influence retrovirus infection of pigtailed macaques, the genital microbiota in 10 cycling macaques was determined by pyrosequencing. the microbiota of all macaques was polymicrobial with a median of 13 distinct genera. strikingly, the genera sneathia and fusobacterium, both in the phylum fusobacteria, accounted for 18.9% and 13.3% of sequences while the next most frequent were prevotella (5.6%), porphyromonas (4.1%), atopobium (3.6%), and parvimonas (2.6%). sequences corresponding to lactobacillus comprised only 2.2% of sequences on average and were essentially all l. amylovorus. longitudinal sampling of the 10 macaques over an 8-week period, which spanned at least one full ovulatory cycle, showed a generally stable presence of the major types of bacteria with some exceptions. these studies show that the microbiota of the pigtailed macaques is substantially dissimilar to that found in most healthy humans, where the genital microbiota is usually dominated by lactobacillus sp. the polymicrobial makeup of the macaque bacterial populations, the paucity of lactobacilli, and the specific types of bacteria present suggest that the pigtailed macaque microbiota could influence vaginal retrovirus infection.

AB  == the complexity of the human microbiome makes it difficult to reveal organizational principles of the community and even more challenging to generate  testable hypotheses. it has been suggested that in the gut microbiome species such as bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are keystone in maintaining the stability and functional adaptability of the microbial community. in this study, we investigate the interspecies associations in a complex microbial biofilm applying systems biology principles. using correlation network analysis we identified bacterial modules that represent important microbial associations within the oral community. we used dental plaque as a model community because of its high diversity and the well known species-species interactions that are common in the  oral biofilm. we analyzed samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with periodontitis, a polymicrobial disease. using results obtained by checkerboard hybridization on cultivable bacteria we identified modules that correlated well with microbial complexes previously described. furthermore, we extended our analysis using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim), which includes a large number of bacterial species, among them uncultivated organisms present in the mouth. two distinct microbial communities appeared in healthy individuals while there was one major type in disease. bacterial modules in all communities did not overlap, indicating that bacteria were able to effectively re-associate with new partners depending on the environmental conditions. we then identified hubs that could act as keystone species in the bacterial modules. based on those results we then cultured a not-yet-cultivated microorganism, tannerella sp. ot286 (clone bu063). after two rounds of enrichment by a selected helper (prevotella oris ot311) we obtained colonies of tannerella sp. ot286 growing on blood agar plates. this system-level  approach would open the possibility of manipulating microbial communities in a targeted fashion as well as associating certain bacterial modules to clinical traits (e.g.: obesity, crohn's disease, periodontal disease, etc).

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == molecular diversity of the foregut bacteria community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius).
AB  == the molecular diversity of the foregut bacterial community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius) in central australia was investigated through comparative analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences prepared from the foregut contents of 12 adult feral camels fed on native vegetation. a total of 267 full-length 16s rrna  gene clones were examined, with 151 operational taxonomic units (otus) identified at a 99% species-level identity cut-off criterion. the prediction of actual diversity in the foregut of the dromedary camel using the chaol approach was 238  otus, while the richness and evenness of the diversity estimated using shannon index was 4.84. the majority of bacteria in the current study were affiliated with the bacterial phylum firmicutes (67% of total clones) and were related to the classes clostridia, bacilli and mollicutes, followed by the bacteroidetes (25%) that were mostly represented by the family prevotellaceae. the remaining phyla were represented by actinobacteria, chloroflexi, cynophyta, lentisphaerae,  planctomycetes, proteobacteria and sphirochaetes. moreover, 11 clones of cultivated bacteria were identified as brevundimonas sp., butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella sp. and ruminococcus flavefaciens. the novelty in this foregut environment is remarkable where 97% of the otus were distantly related to any known sequence in the public database.

TI  == [repression of bacterial biofilms in suppurative necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome by ultrasound cavitation].
AB  == aim: study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (dfs), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (usc). materials and methods: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of dfs, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. in the main group sonoca-180 (siring, germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of usc treatment. results: in patients with dfs bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. in the microbial landscape in dfs patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, bacteroides genera. bacteria of staphylococcus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, escherichia and klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. application of usc in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. conclusion: usc method, when compared  with classical therapy approach in dfs complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.

TI  == burden of emerging anaerobes in the maldi-tof and 16s rrna gene sequencing era.
AB  == the isolation of anaerobes from patients has declined in recent years, whereas their detection by molecular techniques has increased. in the present work, we analyzed the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and 16s rrna gene sequencing to routine identification of anaerobes in clinical microbiology laboratory. we identified 544 isolates of 79 species by routine culture from deep samples in our hospital. maldi-tof ms allowed identification of 332 isolates (61%). the remaining 212 (39%) were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, allowing identification of 202 at the species level. the most common anaerobes were propionibacterium spp. (12%), finegoldia magna (4%), fusobacterium spp. (6%) and  bacteroides spp. (6%). however, among the 79 identified species, seven were new species or genera, including two prevotella conceptionensis, a species previously detected by our team by amplification and sequencing, five anaerococcus sp. and one prevotella sp. beyond the identification of these new species, we also identified several uncommon or previously not described associations between species and specific pathologic conditions. maldi-tof ms-based identification, which will become more effective with future spectra database improvement, will be likely responsible of a burden of emerging anaerobes in clinical microbiology.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == metronidazole resistance in prevotella spp. and description of a new nim gene in  prevotella baroniae.
AB  == nonduplicate clinical isolates of prevotella spp. recovered from patients hospitalized between 2003 and 2006 in two french tertiary-care teaching hospitals were investigated for their susceptibility to metronidazole and the presence of nim genes. of the 188 strains tested, 3 isolates displayed reduced susceptibility to metronidazole after 48 h of incubation, while 27 additional isolates exhibited heterogeneous resistance after prolonged incubation; all 30 of the isolates were  nim negative. among the remaining 158 isolates, 7 nim-positive isolates were detected. all of these strains were identified as prevotella baroniae by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and contained a new nim gene, named nimi, as determined by dna sequence analysis. chromosomal localization of this single-copy gene was demonstrated in all clinical isolates as well as in type strain p. baroniae dsm 16972 by using southern hybridization. no known associated insertion sequence elements were detected upstream of the nimi gene in any of the nim-positive strains by pcr mapping. after prolonged exposure to metronidazole, stable resistant subpopulations could be selected in nimi-positive prevotella isolates (n = 6) as well as in nim-negative prevotella isolates (n = 6), irrespective of their initial susceptibility to this antibiotic. this study is the first description of a new nitroimidazole resistance gene in p. baroniae which seems to be silent and which might be intrinsic in this species. moreover, our findings highlight the fact that high-level resistance to metronidazole may be easily induced in both nim-positive and nim-negative prevotella sp. strains.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

AB  == four strains (num 1903(t), num 1904, num 1912 and num 1925) that were obligately  anaerobic, pigmented, gram-negative-staining rods were isolated from the oral cavity of donkeys. these strains were analysed using the rapid id 32a, api 20a and api zym systems, by dna-dna hybridization with other related species and by 16s rrna gene sequencing. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the new isolates was a member of the genus prevotella and related to prevotella multiformis pppa21(t), showing about 93 % sequence similarity. based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the four strains are representatives of a novel species, for which the name prevotella dentasini sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is num 1903(t) (=jcm 15908(t)=dsm 22229(t)).

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strains isolated from the human oral cavity, oma31(t) and oma130, were characterized by determining their phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular  fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolates belonged to a single species of the genus prevotella. the two isolates showed 100 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with each other and were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t) with 96.4 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity; the next most closely related strains to the isolates were prevotella pallens ahn 10371(t) (96.1 %) and prevotella falsenii jcm 15124(t) (95.3 %). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t), p. falsenii jcm 15124(t) and prevotella nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140( t)  by mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. conventional biochemical tests were unable to differentiate the new isolates from p. intermedia, p. falsenii and p. nigrescens. however, hsp60 gene sequence analysis suggested that  strain oma31(t) was not a representative of p. intermedia, p. pallens, p. falsenii or p. nigrescens. based on these data, a novel species of the genus prevotella, prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., is proposed, with oma31(t) (=jcm 15754(t)=ccug 57723(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from a human brain abscess sample.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic bacterial strain, 7401987t, was isolated from a human brain  abscess sample. cells were gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid to rod-shaped and motile by flagella in a lophotrichous arrangement. the isolate was asaccharolytic and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c15:0 (28.2%), c16:0 (18.0%), iso-c15:0 (12.3%) and iso-c17:0 3-oh (11.7%). 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons showed that the isolate was distantly related to members of  the genera bacteroides (<83.6% similarity), parabacteroides (<79.9% similarity),  tannerella (<79.8% similarity), dysgonomonas (<79.6% similarity), porphyromonas (<79.3% similarity) and prevotella (<78.9% similarity). the low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity values and physiological and biochemical characteristics differentiated strain 7401987t from all known species and indicate that our isolate represents a novel species in a new genus within the phylum bacteroidetes. the name phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of phocaeicola abscessus is 7401987t (=ccug 55929t=csur p22t=dsm  21584t).

AB  == two anaerobic, non-spore-forming, pleomorphic, gram-negative rods, designated yit 11840t and yit 11841t, were isolated from human faeces. the organisms were catalase-negative, produced succinic and acetic acids as end products of glucose  metabolism and had dna g+c contents of approximately 48-49 mol%. although the phenotypic characteristics of these two strains were very similar, analysis of their 16s rrna gene sequences showed that they are only distantly related (93.8%), indicating that they represent two different species. a comparative sequence analysis revealed that these two species are members of the family 'prevotellaceae' but are phylogenetically distant (<88% sequence similarity) from the known genera belonging to this family, including prevotella, hallela and xylanibacter. on the basis of the phylogenetic analysis and physiological tests,  strains yit 11840t and yit 11841t represent two novel species of a new genus, for which the names paraprevotella clara gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain yit 11840t=jcm 14859t=dsm 19731t), the type species, and paraprevotella xylaniphila sp. nov. (type strain yit 11841t=jcm 14860t=dsm 19681t) are proposed.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel xylanase from the symbiotic sphingobacterium sp. tn19.
AB  == a xylanase-encoding gene, designated xyna19, was cloned from sphingobacterium sp. tn19--a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of batocera horsfieldi larvae--and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the full-length xyna19 (1,155 bp in length) encodes a 384-residue polypeptide (xyna19) containing a predicted signal peptide of 24 residues and a catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 10 (gh 10). the deduced amino acid sequence of xyna19 is most similar (53.1% identity) to an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from prevotella bryantii b(1)4. phylogenetic analysis of gh 10 bacteroidia xylanases indicated that gh 10 xylanases from sphingobacteria were separated into two clusters, and xyna19 is more closely related to the xylanases of bacteroidia from gut or rumen  than to those of flavobacteria and sphingobacteria from other sources. recombinant xyna19 (r-xyna19) showed apparent optimal activity at ph 6.5 and 45 degrees c. compared with thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts, r-xyna19 was more active at low temperatures, retaining >65% of its maximum activity at 20-28  degrees c and approximately 40% even at 10 degrees c, and modeling indicated that xyna19 has fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. these properties suggest that xyna19 has various potential applications, especially in aquaculture and the food industry.

AB  == three strains of anaerobic, variably pigmenting, gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral mucosal tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the genus prevotella, being most closely related to prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella veroralis. a novel species, prevotella histicola sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella histicola is saccharolytic and produces acetic acid and succinic acid  as major end products of fermentation and trace to minor amounts of isovaleric acid and lactic acid. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 43 mol%. the type strain of prevotella histicola is t05-04t (=dsm 19854t=ccug 55407t).

TI  == antimicrobial effect and ph of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the ph changes caused by these medications. antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. the zones of  growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by kruskal-wallis test (p<0.05). the ph of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. the largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% chx gel, followed by ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + iodoform, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + zinc oxide, and ca(oh)2 +  water. the mean ph of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for chx gel (ph=7.0). the results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% chx gel, followed by its combination with ca(oh)2 and iodoform.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == prevotella amnii sp. nov., isolated from human amniotic fluid.
AB  == two gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped organisms were isolated from human amniotic fluid. based on morphological and biochemical criteria, the strains were tentatively identified as bacteroidaceae but they did  not appear to correspond to any recognized species of this family. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies showed the strains were highly related to each other and confirmed their placement in the genus prevotella, but sequence divergence values of >4% with reference prevotella species demonstrated that the  organisms from human clinical sources represent a novel species. phylogenetic analysis revealed the novel organism to be most closely related to prevotella bivia, an organism frequently associated with pelvic inflammatory diseases. the major long-chain cellular fatty acids of the novel species consist of iso-c(14:0), anteiso-c(15:0), iso-c(15:0), c(16:0), iso-c(16:0) and iso-3-oh-c(17:0). based on biochemical criteria and phylogenetic considerations,  it is proposed that the unknown isolates from human amniotic fluid be assigned to a new species of the genus prevotella, as prevotella amnii sp. nov. the type strain of prevotella amnii is ccug 53648(t) (=jcm 14753(t)).

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) is the gold standard for detection of pathogens in the lower airways in cystic fibrosis (cf). however, current culture results do not explain all clinical observations in cf, including negative culture results during pulmonary exacerbation and inflammation in the absence of pathogens. we hypothesize that organisms not routinely identified by culture occur in the cf airway and may contribute to disease. to test this hypothesis we used a culture-independent molecular approach, based on use of rrna sequence analysis, to assess the bacterial composition of balf from children with cf and disease controls (dc). specimens from 42 subjects (28 cf) were examined, and approximately 6,600 total clones were screened to identify 121 species of bacteria. in general, a single rrna type dominated clone libraries from cf specimens, but not dc. thirteen cf subjects contained bacteria that are not routinely assessed by culture. in four cf subjects, candidate pathogens were identified and include the anaerobe prevotella denticola, a lysobacter sp., and members of the rickettsiales. the presumptive pathogens tropheryma whipplei and granulicatella elegans were identified in cases from the dc group. the presence of unexpected bacteria in cf may explain inflammation without documented pathogens and consequent failure to respond to standard treatment. these results  show that molecular techniques provide a broader perspective on airway bacteria than do routine clinical cultures and thus can identify targets for further clinical evaluation.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with dystocia and retained placenta in iraqi buffaloes.
AB  == the present study was conducted on 50 recently calved iraqi buffalo cows. depending on the kind of parturition, buffalo cows were divided into two main groups, the first group had normal unassisted parturition (np) (26 animals) and the second group with certain periparturent complications (ppc) (24 animals). after 24 h of parturition, these two groups were further subdivided into two groups as cows expel their foetal membranes in <24 h postpartum and referred as non-retained placenta (nrp) while cows that did not expel their foetal membrane after 24 h referred as retained placenta (rp). sampling for bacteriology, uterine discharge for polymorphonuclear cells per cent and blood samples for polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) and the enzyme creatine kinase activity were performed at 6, 24 and 48 h postpartum. in ppc group, the most prevalent bacteria after 6 h of calving were escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and lactobacillus acidophilus. total bacterial isolates in the uterus of buffaloes with rp in ppc group after 24 and 48 h were 129 and 183 respectively. among the isolates, archanobacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella melaninogenicus and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent isolates after  48 h of rp buffaloes in ppc group. polymorphonuclear neutrophil were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the uterine discharge than in blood in buffaloes with rp in both ppc and np groups. in conclusion, uterine contamination occurs as a result of postpartum ascending contamination by non-specific environmental organisms. the presence of lactobacillus sp. in the uterus indicated a healthy uterus. peripartum complications followed by retention of foetal membranes with the dominance of e. coli in the uterine lumen might favour  the colonization of other bacteria including facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic in the uterine wall of buffaloes.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is particularly common in black women, and in nigeria it is often caused by mycoplasma, as well as atopobium, prevotella and gardnerella sp. antimicrobial metronidazole oral therapy is poorly effective in eradicating the condition and restoring the lactobacillus microbiota in the vagina. in this study, 40 women diagnosed with bv by discharge, fishy odor, sialidase positive test and nugent gram stain scoring, were randomized to receive either two dried capsules containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14  each night for 5 days, or 0.75% metronidazole gel, applied vaginally twice a day  (in the morning and evening). follow-up at day 6, 15 and 30 showed cure of bv in  significantly more probiotic treated subjects (16, 17 and 18/20, respectively) compared to metronidazole treatment (9, 9 and 11/20: p=0.016 at day 6, p=0.002 at day 15 and p=0.056 at day 30). this is the first report of an effective (90%) cure of bv using probiotic lactobacilli. given the correlation between bv and hiv, and the high risk of the latter in nigeria, intravaginal use of lactobacilli could provide women with a self-use therapy, similar to over-the-counter anti-yeast medication, for treatment of urogenital infections.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by ca(oh)2 mixed with sterile water and by chx gel alone. two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. however, 2% chx gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. a paste of ca(oh)2 plus sterile water  inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. in conclusion, 2% chx gel + ca(oh)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than ca(oh)2 manipulated with sterile water.

TI  == the effect of decreasing alkalinity on microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor as analyzed by pcr-sscp.
AB  == pcr-single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and southern blotting techniques were adopted to investigate microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor caused by decreasing influent alkalinity. experimental results indicated that the sulfate-removal rate approached 87% in 25 d under the conditions of influent alkalinity of 4000 mg/l (as caco3) and sulfate-loading rate of 4.8 g/(l*d), which indicated that the bioreactor started  up successfully. the analysis of microbial community structure in this stage showed that lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. were dominant populations. it was found that when influent alkalinity reduced to 1000 mg/l, sulfate-removal rate decreased rapidly to 35% in 3 d. then influent alkalinity was increased to 3000 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to 55%. under these conditions, the populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacte sp., obesumbacterium  sp. and clostridium sp. got to rich, which predominated in the community together with lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. however, when the alkalinity was decreased to 1500 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to and kept  stable at 70% and populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacter sp. and obesumbacterium sp. died out, while some strains of desulfovibrio sp. and clostridium sp. increased in concentration. in order to determine the minimum alkalinity value that the system could tolerate, the influent alkalinity was decreased from 1500 to 400 mg/l secondly. this resulted in the sulfate-removal rate, ph value and effluent alkalinity dropping quickly. the amount of petrotoga  sp., prevotella sp., kluyvera sp. and neisseria sp. reduced obviously. the result data from southern blotting indicated that the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srbs) decreased with influent alkalinity dropping. analysis of the microbial community structure and diversity showed that the srbs populations were very abundant in the inoculated activated sludge and the alkalinity decrease caused the reduction of the populations noted. most of resident populations in the bioreactor were fermentative acidogenic bacteria (fabs), among which the phylum firmicute was in the majority, but srbs were very few. this community structure demonstrates the cooperation between srbs and fabs, which sustains the  system's high sulfate-removal and operation stability.

TI  == xylanibacter oryzae gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, xylanolytic bacterium isolated from rice-plant residue in flooded  rice-field soil in japan.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, xylanolytic bacterium, strain kb3(t), isolated from rice-plant residue in flooded anoxic rice-field soil in japan, was characterized  phenotypically and phylogenetically. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, short to filamentous rods. growth of the strain was remarkably stimulated by the addition of haemin to the medium. the novel strain utilized various sugars including xylan, xylose, pectin and carboxymethylcellulose and produced acetate, propionate and succinate with a small amount of malate. propionate production was stimulated by the addition of a b-vitamin mixture or cobalamin to the medium. the novel strain was slightly acidophilic with an optimum ph 5.7-6.2 and the optimum growth temperature was 30 degrees c. oxidase,  catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were negative. aesculin was hydrolysed.  the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0) and iso-3-oh c(17 : 0). the major respiratory quinones were menaquinones mk-12(h(2)) and mk-13(h(2)). the genomic dna g+c content was 43.6 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence placed the strain in the phylum bacteroidetes. the closest related  species was prevotella bivia with a 16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 89.5 %.  prevotella albensis and prevotella oulorum were the next closest recognized species with sequence similarities of 89.1 %. based on a comprehensive examination of the differences in phylogenetic, ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain kb3(t) and those of related species, a novel genus and species, xylanibacter oryzae gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed to  accommodate strain kb3(t). the type strain of the novel species is kb3(t) (=jcm 13648(t)=dsm 17970(t)).

TI  == microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to analyze the microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses. methods: thirty patients, mean age 24,2 years, with peritonsillar abscesses underwent aspiration of at least 3 ml of pus, which was cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. results: 87% samples showed positive cultures. aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria were isolated from 23% aspirates, mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 60%, and anaerobic bacteria  from only 3% aspirate. a total of 69 bacterial isolates (34 aerobic and 35 anaerobic) were recovered. the most common aerobic isolate was streptococcus sp,  with streptococcus pyogenes being identified in 23% of aspirates. the predominant anaerobic isolates were prevotella sp and peptostreptococcus sp. patients had received previous antimicrobial therapy in 63% cases. in this group, 1.8 isolates per specimen were recovered, a lower number than in the untreated group (3.0 per  specimen). no significant difference in the species isolated was observed between these two groups. conclusion: peritonsillar abscess is usually a polymicrobial infection, with predominance of anaerobic bacteria. the number of agents isolated was larger in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, but the use of antimicrobial drugs did not interfere with the type of bacterium isolated.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == an examination of 'unidentified' prevotella (formerly pinlo) using rapd-pcr and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == prevotella intermedia- and prevotella nigrescens-like organisms (pinlo) have been described as organisms which are phenotypically and biochemically similar to p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and the species p. pallens was created to include some of them. other pinlo groups which do not fit the definition of p. pallens exist, and in this study these 'unidentified' prevotella sp. were compared with p. corporis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and p. pallens using commercial identification kits, glc, rapd-pcr and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. the rapid id 32 a and the rapid ana ii system both identified all 'unidentified' prevotella as p. intermedia. similarly they gave this identification to all the species tested (with the exception of p. corporis using the rapid ana ii system)  clearly demonstrating biochemical similarities. gas liquid chromatography (glc) analysis of the volatile end-products of fermentation could not distinguish between strains. rapd-pcr using arbitrary primer l10 demonstrated intra-species homogeneity within pinlo strains with amplification profiles which differed from  other prevotella species tested. cluster analysis of the amplification profiles confirmed species divisions and yielded a distinct 'unidentified' prevotella cluster. comparison of partial 16s rdna sequences displayed 98% sequence similarity between the 'unidentified' prevotella strains, although 2 strains, hst 1156 and hst 2160 displayed 100% identity. the highest similarity between groups  was seen between 'unidentified' prevotella strains and p. corporis (approximately 94% similarity). the dna techniques used here confirm that 'unidentified' prevotella strains are distinct from the other species of prevotella tested, including p. pallens. partial 16s rdna sequence comparisons suggested a close relationship with p. corporis.

TI  == individual microflora beget unique oral microcosms.
AB  == aims: to examine the efficacy of the multiple sorbarod device (msd) for the reproduction of inter-individual variations in oral microbiotas. the msd supports sessile growth on parallel cellulose filters, perfused with artificial saliva. this enables biofilms (bf) to be grown and sampled, together with released cells  in eluted medium (perfusates, pas). methods and results: two sets of triplicate msds were established. one set was inoculated using fresh saliva from three separate volunteers; the second set was inoculated from one saliva donor. both were incubated in an anaerobic cabinet. bf and pa were analysed at 24-h intervals by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rdna. hierarchical dendrograms were constructed in order to sort community fingerprints over time, based on community relatedness. the msd supported complex oral communities, as evidenced by dgge (>20 distinct dgge bands) and confocal scanning laser microscopy. dgge band sequencing revealed bacteriological diversity and a high incidence of anaerobic species, including prevotella sp. dendrograms demonstrated marked inter-individual variation in the relative species abundance within salivary inocula from different volunteers (dv) and each associated msd (all >45%, majority c. 85% concordance). less variation was shown between triplicate models established using saliva from a single volunteer (sv) (all >58%; majority  c. 95% concordance). pas clustered together with the associated biofilms and inocula in the majority of cases for the dv msds whilst sv msd community profiles clustered between replicate msds. conclusions: data indicate that marked inter-individual variations in human salivary composition can be partially replicated in individualized msd microcosms. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the in vitro reproduction of individual oral microbiotas and suggests that taking inter-individual variability into account will increase the relevance of microcosm studies.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. for such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. pastes were prepared with ca(oh)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (cmcp), cmcp + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and cmcp + polyethyleneglycol. the time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the kruskal wallis test at 5% significance level. timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). in conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. these findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.

(2004). j clin microbiol 42, 5238-5244], with about 99% similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmenting, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. the isolates could be differentiated from other prevotella species by d-mannitol, d-melezitose, d-sorbitol and d-trehalose fermentation in api 20a tests. the cellular fatty acid composition of strains pppa16, pppa20(t), pppa24, pppa31, eppa6 and eppa7 was significantly different from that of other prevotella species. compared with other prevotella species, only these six strains contained dimethyl acetals. the  major menaquinones of the clinical isolates were mk-12 and mk-13, whereas the major menaquinones of other prevotella species were mk-10 and mk-11. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multisaccharivorax sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa20(t) (=jcm 12954(t)=dsm 17128(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

AB  == four bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, pppa19, pppa21(t), pppa28 and pppa30, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and the phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of  the isolates was a member of the genus prevotella. these strains were related to  prevotella denticola with about 95 % similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. however, the cells of these strains were often cocci (coccobacilli), depending on the cultivation time. colonies of different sizes were detected on eggerth gagnon agar plates for these strains. the cells forming large colonies were cocci, whereas those forming small colonies were cocci and rods. however, 16s rrna gene  sequence comparison of colonies of different sizes revealed that only a single organism was present. although these strains had phenotypic characteristics that  were similar to those of p. denticola jcm 8528, they could be differentiated from p. denticola jcm 8528 by aesculin hydrolysis and d-cellobiose fermentation in api 20a tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinction of  these four strains with respect to p. denticola jcm 8528. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multiformis sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa21(t) (=jcm 12541(t)=dsm 16608(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == microbiological culture analysis of the tongue anaerobic microflora in subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == objective: determination of the microflora present on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis using conventional microbiological culture methods. methods: twenty-one halitosis and 20 control patients were recruited using a strict clinical protocol. samples were collected from the posterior dorsum of the tongue using a sterile brush. each sample was vortex mixed for 30 s and serial 10-fold dilutions to 10(-7) were carried out. samples were plated onto fastidious anaerobe agar (faa) and faa enriched with vancomycin. these were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 10 days at 37 degrees c. strict anaerobes were identified by metronidazole sensitivity and bacteria were identified to genus level by a combination of colony morphology, gram staining and biochemical and enzymatic tests (rapid id 32 a). results: the predominant species in test and control groups were veillonella sp. and prevotella sp. greater species diversity was found in the halitosis samples compared with controls. the halitosis samples contained an increased incidence of unidentifiable gram-negative rods, gram-positive rods and gram-negative coccobacilli. conclusions: there was no obvious association between halitosis and any specific bacterial genus. the increased species diversity found in halitosis  samples suggests that halitosis may be the result of complex interactions between several bacterial species. the role of uncultivable bacteria may also be important in contributing to this process.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.

TI  == detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in norway and usa were screened for the presence of the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), bla(ampc), bla(cfxa), and bla(cepa/cbla) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified dna. thirty-four of the  53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the pcr assays. all beta-lactamase-producing prevotella and capnocytophaga spp. were cfxa positive. tem-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of escherichia coli and neisseria sp., and one strain of citrobacter freundii possessed an ampc-type  beta-lactamase. screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. sequence analyses showed that most cfxa positive prevotella and capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the cfxa2 and cfxa3 enzyme. the present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.

TI  == microbiological basis of oral infections and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. the special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. different anaerobic species belonging to the peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, gemella, and porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species streptococcus, staphylococcus, and corynebacterium. each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (actinomyces, prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these  conditions, as can yeasts (candida sp., histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (entamoeba gingivalis, trichomonas tenax). when infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). empirical treatment is  administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. however, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there  is a noticeable trend towards resistances. as a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. in recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. this in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections,  so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.

TI  == substance p enhances expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory factors in dental pulp cells.
AB  == to examine how substance p (sp) is related with dental pulp inflammation, we examined the effects of sp on expression of genes for inflammatory factors in human dental pulp cell cultures. using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that prevotella intermedia lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced expression of sp and sp-receptor mrnas, and that somatostatin inhibited the lps-induced expression of sp mrna. we also found that sp enhanced lps-induced stimulation of nf-kappab binding activity. in addition, sp induced expression of  cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-10 receptor mrnas. in contrast, sp inhibited expression of interferon-gamma receptor mrna. these results suggest that sp may play a regulatory role in the immunological response of dental pulp tissue to pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == relationship of subgingival and salivary microbiota to gingival overgrowth in heart transplant patients following cyclosporin a therapy.
AB  == background: severe gingival overgrowth (go) is induced in patients taking cyclosporin a (csa) following organ transplantation. determining which patient will develop go is still not possible. the purpose of this study was to establish an association between csa and gingival overgrowth in heart transplant patients taking into account periodontal and microbiological conditions. methods: thirty patients (10 female, 20 male; range: 13 to 67 years; mean age: 44.89) undergoing  csa treatment were evaluated using the gingival index (gi), plaque index (pi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival samples collected from the deepest site of each quadrant and saliva samples were submitted to microbial analysis. all patients had at least 12 teeth. exclusion criteria were the use of antibiotics and/or having undergone periodontal treatment 6 months prior to the study. patients were divided in two groups: with  gingival (go+) and without gingival overgrowth (go-). results: there were no statistically significant differences between the go+ and go- groups when csa dosage, time since transplant, gi, pi, pd, and cal were compared. microbiological examination of the subgingival samples detected the following microorganisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), porphyromonas gingivalis (36%), prevotella intermedia (93%), fusobacterium sp. (66%), campylobacter rectus (30%), micromonas micros (66%), enteric rods (0%), and yeasts (30%). a positive association between m. micros and the go+ group was found (p < 0.001). yeasts were detected in 30% of the subgingival and saliva samples. conclusions: clinical parameters were not sufficient to determine which patients would develop go. however, colonization by m. micros might play a role in the etiology of go.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

AB  == two bacterial strains, ehs11(t) and epsa11(t), which were isolated from the human oral cavity, were characterized in terms of phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic position based on  16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus prevotella. strain ehs11(t) was related to prevotella loescheii (about 95 % similarity), whereas strain epsa11(t) was related to prevotella oris (about 94 % similarity). both strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile,  gram-negative rods. the cellular fatty acid composition of strain epsa11(t) was very similar to that of p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the other hand, the cellular fatty acid composition of strain ehs11(t) was significantly different from those  of other prevotella species. the predominant fatty acids in strain ehs11(t) are c(18 : 1)omega9c, c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) 3-oh, whereas other prevotella species, except for p. loescheii jcm 8530(t), possess anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh and c(18 : 1)omega9c. the predominant fatty acids in p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) are anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(18 : 1)omega9c. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed a genomic distinction of strains ehs11(t) and  epsa11(t) from p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) and p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the basis of  these data, two novel prevotella species are proposed: prevotella shahii sp. nov. and prevotella salivae sp. nov. the type strains of p. shahii and p. salivae are  ehs11(t) (=jcm 12083(t)=dsm 15611(t)) and epsa11(t) (=jcm 12084(t)=dsm 15606(t)), respectively.

AB  == anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. the types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include  para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. the anaerobes  recovered in these studies were gram-negative bacilli (including bacteroides fragilis and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp.), clostridium sp., anaerobic gram-positive cocci and actinomyces sp. in many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. the recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. these antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == assessment of equine fecal contamination: the search for alternative bacterial source-tracking targets.
AB  == 16s rdna clone libraries were evaluated for detection of fecal source-identifying bacteria from a collapsed equine manure pile. libraries were constructed using universal eubacterial primers and bacteroides-prevotella group-specific primers.  eubacterial sequences indicated that upstream and downstream water samples were predominantly beta- and gamma-proteobacteria (35 and 19%, respectively), while the manure library consisted predominantly of firmicutes (31%) and previously unidentified sequences (60%). manure-specific eubacterial sequences were not detectable beyond 5 m downstream of the pile, suggesting either poor survival or  high dilution rates. in contrast, bacteroides and prevotella sp. sequences were detected both in manure and downstream using group-specific primers. novel sequences from bacteroides and prevotella analysis produced an equine-specific phylogenetic cluster as compared to previous data sets obtained for human and bovine samples. while these results suggest that some anaerobic fecal bacteria might be potential identifiers for use in source-tracking applications, a comprehensive examination of environmental sequences within these species should  be performed before methods targeting these bacterial groups are applied to watersheds for development of microbial source-tracking protocols.

AB  == background: microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. methods: thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. the patients were subclassified into 17  localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. in each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing  depth, 39 sites). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the 16s ribosomal rna gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. results: the prevalences were 75% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for micromonas micros (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for treponema sp. the prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. logistic regression analysis showed that p. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, p = 0.015). conclusions: our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with korean aggressive periodontitis. in particular, p. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  == dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (tr)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (trd). this was diluted so that the  antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with primers specific for the v2-v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rrna gene (rdna). dominant isolates and pcr amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16s rdna. trd caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion  of lactobacilli. dgge indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria  and showed that a porphyromonas sp. and selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by trd. pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that neisseria subflava, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to tr, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least  susceptible. clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of tr activity. the mean mics of tr, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin v, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5  days of exposure to trd showed few significant changes. in conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to trd showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in view of its localization, brain abscess (ba) usually requires medical and surgical care. a broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. a retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented ba  admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. ba due to anaerobic bacteria (group a) were compared with other cases (group b) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of ba with isolated anaerobic bacteria. between 1991 and 2000, ba were diagnosed in 42 patients (28m, 14f, mean age 54.6  y). no differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with ba caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with ba. anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients  (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. the most frequently isolated species were fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), prevotella sp. (n = 8), actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and bacteroides sp. (n = 4). compared with group b, group a had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and  ear, nose and throat (ent) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). these results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in ba. the presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ent infection, or both. therapy should take into  account this high frequency.

TI  == etiology of persistent tubo-ovarian abscess in nairobi, kenya.
AB  == objective: to study the microbial etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess (toa). methods: we recruited 11 women in nairobi, kenya who failed antibiotic therapy alone and required surgical drainage of a presumptive toa. pus from the nine abscesses and two pyosalpinges were collected and cultured for aerobic, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. results: eleven women suspected of having a toa were hospitalized and treated for a median of 6 days (range 3-14 days) prior to surgical drainage of the abscess. nine (82%) specimens were culture positive. aerobes were present in all nine specimens. seven of the nine positive cultures (78%) were polymicrobial and five of the polymicrobial cultures contained both anaerobes and aerobes. anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (prevotella sp., porphyromonas sp. and bacteroides sp., escherichia coli) and streptococcus sp. (s. viridans and s. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: in kenya, persistent toas are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of althaea officinalis l. roots, arnica montana l. flowers, calendula officinalis l. flowers, hamamelis virginiana l. leaves, illicium verum hook. fruits and melissa  officinalis l. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veilonella parvula, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces odontolyticus. the methanol extracts of h. virginiana and a. montana and, to a lesser extent, a. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (mic < or = 2048 mg/l) against many of the species tested. in comparison, m. officinalis and c. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (mic > or = 2048 mg/l) against all the tested species with the exception of prevotella sp. illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against e. corrodens. the results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of h. virginiana, a. montana and a. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.

TI  == lethal photosensitization in microbiological treatment of ligature-induced peri-implantitis: a preliminary study in dogs.
AB  == this pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue o (tbo,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mw gaalas diode laser. the mean initial and final  bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 cfu/ml, respectively for tvc (p < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 cfu/ml for p. intermedia/nigrescens (p = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 cfu/ml for fusobacterium spp. (p = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 cfu/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (p = 0.0039). it may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.

TI  == microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == crestal bone loss around submerged and exposed unloaded dental implants: a radiographic and microbiological descriptive study.
AB  == the successful maintenance of crestal bone surrounding dental implants is imperative for long-term implant success. crestal bone loss is reportedly related to stress. however, early perforation and partial exposure of the implant's covering device are a focus for plaque accumulation, which, if left untreated, may result in inflammation. the objective of this study was to evaluate the crestal bone levels adjacent to submerged and exposed unloaded dental implants during the initial healing phase. in addition, the microbiota around exposed implants were studied. bilateral implants were placed in the mandible of 10 patients. in one quadrant, the implants were covered by the flap. in the other quadrant, the flap was sutured, leaving the cover screws completely exposed. standardized periapical radiographs were obtained at implant placement and 4 months later. radiographs were digitalized, aligned, and analyzed with a computer-assisted method. cultures were obtained from exposed implant sites. all  patients showed more crestal bone loss around exposed dental implants compared to submerged implants. prevotella sp., streptococcus beta-hemoliticus, and fusobacterium sp. were the microorganisms identified in most of the sites. the exposure of the implant covering device created foci for bacterial plaque accumulation, which may have facilitated periimplant crestal bone loss. the initial healing phase follow-up may be critical for implant success.

TI  == prevalence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli in routine clinical specimens.
AB  == a total of 206 gram negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 2591 routine clinical specimens. majority of them (78.2%) were part of a mixed flora. a high incidence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli was found in post-operative wound infections and diabetic foot infections (30.1%), followed by necrotizing fasciitis and crush injuries (18%), pus of empyema and lung abscesses (14.5%) and aspirates from other deep abscesses (10.7%). bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently recognized species (42.2%), followed by fusobacterium sp. (17.4%), prevotella sp. (15.1%) and porphyromonas sp. (11.2%). neomycin blood agar plate yielded the maximum number (72.8%) of strains in pure culture. gram negative anaerobic bacilli in infective processes are significantly on the rise and so suspected cultures should be processed for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

TI  == high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == this prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. one to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the prevotella genus (bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). pcr assays were used to detect cfxa and cepa/cbla, the genes encoding class a/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the bacteroides fragilis group. the present investigation confirmed  the role of prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. additionally, this pcr screening showed (1): the high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepa/cbla (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxa in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.

AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

AB  == in this study the authors examined the activity of flurithromycin compared to that of erythromycin, spiramycin and penicillin against 107 strains of various species supposed to cause periodontitis. the range of mics of flurithromycin was: < or =0.06-2 mg/l for p. gingivalis (28 isolates), 0.06-2 mg/l for p. melaninogenica (7), 0.5-4 mg/l for p. intermedia (5), 0.25-8 mg/l for prevotella  sp. (8), 1-16 mg/l for f. nucleatum (14), 0.12-0.5 mg/l for w. recta (2), 0.5-32  mg/l for e. corrodens, 0.5-2 mg/l for b. forsythus (2); < or =0.06-64 mg/l for peptostreptococcus sp. (11), < or =0.06-1 mg/l for a. odontolyticus (11) and for  a. naeslundii (7) and < or =0.06-16 mg/l for a. viscosus (7). macrolide activity  was ranked in decreasing order from flurithromycin to erythromycin to spiramycin. beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in prevotella sp. (20%) and in f. nucleatum (7%). isolates which were beta-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among peptostreptococcus sp. and actinomyces sp. a post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for flurithromycin on p. gingivalis and e. corrodens. the good in vitro activity of flurithromycin against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases.

AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == microbiology of serous otitis media in children: correlation with age and length  of effusion.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to correlate the microbiology of serous otitis media in children with the duration of the condition and the patient's age. aspirates of serous ear fluids from 114 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 47 patients (41%). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 27 aspirates (57% of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria only in 7 (15%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 13 (28%). a total of 83 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.2 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total  of 57 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus sp (12). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (10), prevotella spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (4). the rate of positive cultures (20 of 36; 56%) was higher in patients younger than 2 years of age than in those older than 2 years of age (27 of 78; 35%). streptococcus pneumoniae and h influenzae were more often isolated in children younger than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 3 to 5 months, whereas anaerobes were recovered more often in those older than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 6 to 13 months. these data illustrate the effects of the length of effusion and age on the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in serous otitis media.

TI  == dysgonomonas gen. nov. to accommodate dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov., an organism isolated from a human gall bladder, and dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides (formerly cdc group df-3).
AB  == results of a polyphasic taxonomic study on an unknown gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccobacillus-shaped organism isolated from an infected  human gall bladder are presented. phenotypic and molecular taxonomic studies revealed the organism to be close to, but distinct from, organisms designated cdc (centers for disease control and prevention) group df-3. the unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from reference strains of bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas and related taxa by 16s rrna gene sequencing, biochemical tests, analysis of cellular long-chain fatty acids and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. based on the results of the present study, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in a new genus, dysgonomonas, as dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov. (type strain ccug 42882t = cip 106420t). in addition, a new species, dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate strains previously belonging to cdc group df-3. the type species of the genus dysgonomonas is dysgonomonas gadei.

TI  == detection of major putative periodontopathogens in korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == the microbial spectrum of brain abscess with special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer rapid ana ii panel and e-test methods, respectively. characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  in another three (16.6%) patients. there were nine anaerobic isolates. the predominant anaerobes were prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). a total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were gram-positive cocci were recovered. all the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of p. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. there was complete agreement between the identification  based on biochemical profiles and rflp patterns. these findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == ecological effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on defined mixed cultures of oral species grown in continuous culture.
AB  == the effects of triclosan and its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate were studied using a continuous culture microcosm model. two conditions were simulated, a caries-like state (ph 5.5 with artificial saliva plus glucose as growth medium) and a periodontal disease-like state (ph 7.5 with  bhi plus yeast extract, haemin and cysteine as growth medium). both cultures were maintained anaerobically at 37 degrees c at a growth rate of 0.1/h. steady-state  chemostats were pulsed with triclosan or triclosan monophosphate (initial concentrations between 20 and 40 mg/l) and changes in the ecological composition  noted after 6 h. the caries-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, lactobacillus and veillonella sp. with low but detectable levels of neisseria, actinomyces and fusobacterium sp. no significant ecological shifts occurred following pulses of either antimicrobial agent; all species were affected to approximately the same degree. the periodontal disease-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, fusobacterium, veillonella, actinomyces, prevotella and porphyromonas sp. with low numbers of neisseria and lactobacillus sp. significant ecological shifts were apparent following pulses of triclosan. the streptococci became the dominant group followed by fusobacterium sp. for triclosan monophosphate, the streptococci again became dominant although  lactobacillus and actinomyces were now the main sub-dominant species and gram-negative anaerobes including fusobacterium sp. were markedly inhibited. it is concluded that in the periodontal disease state, both triclosan and triclosan  monophosphate affected the gram-negative anaerobes to a greater extent than the gram-positive groups and that this effect was more marked for triclosan monophosphate.

TI  == bacterial interference in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of sinusitis prone and non-sinusitis prone children.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of sinusitis prone (sp) children, with their recovery in non-sinusitis prone (n-sp) children. nasopharyngeal and nasal cultures were taken from 20 sp and 20 n-sp children. potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these micro-organisms were identified. twenty-one potential pathogens (1.05 patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures from 14 of the 20 sp children, and 10 (0.5 patient) were  recovered from 6 of the 20 nsp (p < 0.05). bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha and non-haemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (prevotella and peptostreptococcus species) and four potential pathogens was observed. bacterial interference was noted in 64 instances against 4 potential pathogens by 24 normal flora isolates that were recovered from 7 of the sp group  and in 144 instances by 47 isolates from 18 of the nsp group (p < 0.05). nineteen potential pathogens (0.95/patient) were isolated from nasal cultures of 13 of the 20 sp children and 8 (0.4/patient) were recovered from 5 of the 20 nsp (p < 0.05). bacterial interference by similar micro-organisms was noted in 21 instances by 9 normal flora isolates that were recovered from 5 of the sp group,  and in 63 instances by 26 isolates from 15 of the nsp group (p < 0.05). our findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal and nasal flora of nsp children contains more aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms with interfering capability and less potential pathogens than that of sp children.

TI  == diversity of extracellular proteolytic activities among prevotella species from the rumen.
AB  == the current research was aimed at comparing proteolytic activities among ruminal  prevotella spp. growth rates of prevotella sp. 2202, prevotella ruminicola d31d,  p. brevis ga33, p. albensis m384, and p. bryantii b(1)4 varied with n source, and no one n source produced the fastest growth in all species. proteolytic activity  was greatest with casein compared with peptides, aa, and nh(4)cl in all species.  proteolytic activity of prevotella sp. 2202, p. brevis ga33, and p. bryantii b(1)4 was modulated by n source. with gelatin co-polymerized sds-page, the extracellular activities of the prevotella spp. showed wide variation in number,  size, and type of proteases. prevotella sp. 2202 and p. albensis m384 produced metalloproteases of low molecular weight (40 kda). p. ruminicola d31d produced one cysteine protease (100-200 kda) and two metalloproteases (90-100 kda). p. brevis ga33 generated a diffuse clearing zone (95-160 kda) containing serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases. p. bryantii b(1)4 produced a metalloprotease greater than 200 kda in size. the molecular sizes provided are estimations and served only to differentiate among the bacterial species in this study. large variations in proteolytic activities among species and the known genetic diversity of the prevotella taxon suggested that targeting this bacterial assemblage for genetic manipulation in order to alter the bacterial impact on ruminal protein degradation would be difficult.

TI  == mutant analysis of prevotella sp. plaa-lacz fusion protein expression in escherichia coli: support for an essential role of the stem-loop.
AB  == this study investigated the involvement of rna folding in the synthesis of a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase activity. the coding gap region of the prevotella loescheii adhesin gene plaa was fused in-frame with the escherichia coli lacz gene on plasmid psk105. n-terminal sequencing of the expressed plaa-lacz protein indicated that it resulted from translational initiation at a fortuitous ribosomal-binding site within the plaa sequence at nt 570. specific mutations were introduced in the stem-loop region that precedes the gap sequence. analysis of stem-loop mutants, together with the introduction of compensatory mutations that restored activity, supports a requirement for stem-loop formation  within the plaa sequence preceding the translational initiation site. a mutation  reducing the predicted size of the loop, but preserving the stem structure, inactivated fusion protein synthesis. a suppressor mutation predicted to restore  the size of the loop restored efficient fusion protein synthesis. in addition, the sequence preceding the translational start site of the plaa-lacz fusion has several similarities to sequences that function as translational enhancers in prokaryotes. these include a stem-loop structure, an a-u rich region preceding the initiation codon, and a region of homology to 16s rrna.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

(6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == phylogenetic characterization and proposal of a new pigmented species to the genus prevotella: prevotella pallens sp. nov.
AB  == complete 16s rrna gene sequences of three representative strains of anaerobic, gram-negative, pigmented, moderately saccharolytic, indole-positive bacteria isolated from the oral cavity of humans were determined. according to comparative analyses of the rrna sequence data, this organism represents a previously unknown species within the genus prevotella. in addition, 22 representative strains and 21 reference strains (including 11 prevotella intermedia and 10 prevotella nigrescens strains) were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis. the strains were consistently separated into three clearly distinct groups, corresponding to their previous entities. on the basis of the present phylogenetic results that confirmed our biochemical and genetic data, we propose  a new species, prevotella pallens. the type strain is nctc 13042 (= ahn 10371).

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == in-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  == one hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. all isolates, except rothia spp. (one), enterococcus avium (three), haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of prevotella, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides and porphyromonas. all the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. a potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the mics of  spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of eubacterium, two of  lactobacilli, one strain of peptostreptococcus sp. and one clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.

TI  == glutamate dehydrogenase activity profiles for type strains of ruminal prevotella  spp.
AB  == the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) activities for the type strains of prevotella ruminicola (strain 23), prevotella brevis (strain ga33), and prevotella bryantii  (strain b(1)4) were assessed by a combination of enzyme assays and analysis of migration patterns of gdh proteins following nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. unlike results with most other prokaryotes, but similar to results with other members of the family bacteroidaceae, nadph-utilizing specific activity was greatest in all species following ammonia-limited growth. similar also to previous findings with p. bryantii, the nad(p)h-utilizing gdh activity of p. ruminicola can be attributed to a single protein. however, p. brevis produces  an additional gdh protein(s) in response to growth with peptides. these results conclusively demonstrate that all type strains of the ruminal prevotella sp. grouping possess gdh activity.

TI  == phenotypic diversity among ruminal isolates of prevotella ruminicola: proposal of prevotella brevis sp. nov., prevotella bryantii sp. nov., and prevotella albensis sp. nov. and redefinition of prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == selected phenotypic characteristics of isolates of prevotella ruminicola (formerly bacteroides ruminicola) were studied in order to establish whether the  characteristics of genotypic strain groups established previously on the basis of 16s ribosomal dna sequences differed systematically. among strains formerly considered p. ruminicola subsp. brevis, strains related to strain ga33t (t = type strain) typically failed to produce carboxymethyl cellulase (cmcase) activity detectable by plate assays and failed to ferment xylose, while strains related to strain b14t produced abundant cmcase and fermented xylose. we propose that strains related to ga33t, which have dna g + c contents between 45 and 51 mol%, should be assigned to a new species, prevotella brevis, and that strains related  to b14t, which have dna g + c contents between 39 and 43 mol%, should be assigned to another new species, prevotella bryantii. most of the isolates formerly classified as p. ruminicola subsp. ruminicola strains produced cmcase and had dna g + c contents between 45 and 51 mol%, and we propose that these organisms should be placed in the redefined species p. ruminicola. a small group of isolates that  have lower g + c contents are assigned to another new species, prevotella albensis. most p. brevis and p. bryantii strains produced abundatn extracellular  dnase activity. proteinase activities (as determined by [14c]casein hydrolysis) varied widely between strains, and p. brevis strains exhibited the highest mean activity. all strains produced dipeptidyl peptidase activity, but the relative activities against different peptide substrates exhibited by p. bryantii, p. albensis, and p. brevis differed systematically. the phenotypic differences among the newly defined species suggest that they may occupy distinct niches within the rumen ecosystem.

TI  == microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. materials and methods: the current literature is reviewed. review: sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. aureus, fusobacterium sp., and prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (s. pneumoniae). the pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to  cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. conclusions: the indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. the direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections. proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.

TI  == bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  == objective: to assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. methods: ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within  15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. demographic, labor,  delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. results: bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (p = .02). isolates included group b streptococcus (n = 5), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of prevotella bivia, g vaginalis,  and viridans streptococci (n = 1). bacteremia was associated with earlier median  gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. conclusion: bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. many of the isolates are capable  of causing endocarditis. appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  == whole genomic and randomly-cloned dna probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. the specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. the cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. a significant degree of cross-reactivity with bacteroides species, capnocytophaga sp. and prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. the cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target dna to be detected during hybridization. although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. methods: studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. the model consisted of a mixed culture  of lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus epidermidis, prevotella bivia, and group d streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. the status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. results: challenge of the model with c albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in a decrease in c albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. however, treatment also altered other components of  the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. addition of clotrimazole  (100 micrograms/ml) to the system in the absence of c albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. conclusions: candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. clotrimazole, although effective against c albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the  normal vaginal microflora. one of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk  of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.

AB  == the pathogenicity of eight clinical isolates of non-type b haemophilus influenzae was investigated by inoculating them subcutaneously into mice, alone or mixed with viable or non-viable bacteria of certain other species. three of the h. influenzae isolates were non-capsulated while five were slightly capsulated (less than 1% of organisms had capsules). the other strains of bacteria tested were four isolates of capsulated and four isolates of non-capsulated pigmented strains of prevotella sp. and porphyromonus sp. as well as a capsulate klebsiella pneumoniae ("helpers"). none of the non-capsulated strains induced an abscess when inoculated alone. following co-inoculation of viable or non-viable "helpers" with h. influenzae, abscesses were formed in all instances in which the "helper"  had a capsule. profusely capsulated cells of h. influenzae were recovered, however, only from abscesses induced with the five slightly capsulated strains of h. influenzae. these capsulated organisms were found serologically to be of type  b and induced abscesses when inoculated alone. our findings illustrate the ability of non-capsulated strains of h. influenzae to produce progeny of capsulated type b organisms after co-inoculation with certain other species.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. the piperacillin/tazobactam study group.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. methods: this was  a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper  genital tract. patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the united states and two hospitals in canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. one group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. cultures for chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. results: two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. the most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). the most common microorganisms recovered included: peptostreptococcus sp (99), prevotella sp (87), black pigmented bacteroides (29), b fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group b streptococcus (26),  escherichia coli (31), neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and c trachomatis (19). a favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin  patients. among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; p = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. none of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. conclusion: the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.

TI  == the role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods (bacteroides sp., prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. the pathogenicity of bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium, and afgpc was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and afgpc-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. as determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative  cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and also between most afgpc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == the management of acute, serous and chronic otitis media: the role of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one which can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om enables the most appropriate treatment regimen to be selected and thus minimizes further  complications which may require hospital admission and surgery. the microbiology  of acute, serous and chronic om is reviewed, with particular regard to the role of anaerobic bacteria. anaerobes, mainly gram-positive cocci, have been recovered from 25% of the ear aspirates of patients with acute otitis media. in a study of  serous om, anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 12% of the culture-positive aspirates. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci and pigmented prevotella. several studies have reported the recovery of anaerobes from about 50% of patients with chronic om and those with cholesteatoma. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella, porphyromonas sp., bacteroides spp. and fusobacterium spp. many of these organisms produce beta-lactamase which might have contributed to the failure of the patients to respond to penicillins. the appropriate antimicrobial therapy for acute, serous and chronic otitis media is discussed.

TI  == biochemical and chemical studies on strains designated prevotella intermedia and  proposal of a new pigmented species, prevotella nigrescens sp. nov.
AB  == a total of 31 strains of prevotella intermedia were subjected to dna-dna hybridization and were characterized by performing physiological tests and by performing a multilocus enzyme analysis, using malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. all of the strains assigned to p. intermedia fermented glucose and sucrose, hydrolyzed starch but not esculin, and produced indole, acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and succinic acids as metabolic end products. the results of dna reassociation experiments performed with the reference probe permitted separation of the strains into two well-defined homology groups. in addition, strains with dnas that hybridized with dna from strain atcc 25611t (t = type strain) had high levels of peptidase activity and cleaved lipid substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl laurate and 4-methylumbellifelyl elaidate). multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed two electromorphic profiles, one characteristic of strain atcc 25611t and the other characteristic of strain atcc 33563t. we propose that a new species, prevotella nigrescens, should be created for the genetically distinct group of strains that hybridized with strain atcc 33563t. strain atcc 33563 is designated the type strain of p. nigrescens.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  == the bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. predisposing conditions were present in all instances. sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. the abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients.  there were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 bacteroides fragilis group), fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and prevotella sp.  and actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). a total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 gram-positive cocci and 6 haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess,  and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == the bacteriology of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == plaque samples from 22 ulcerated sites in eight patients with anug were cultured  using quantitative anaerobic procedures and were examined microscopically. the partial characterization of the predominant cultivable flora revealed a constant  flora comprised of a limited number of bacterial types and a variable flora composed of a heterogeneous array of bacterial types. this constant flora would appear to be pathognomonic of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (anug) and  included the various treponema and selenomonas sp., which comprised about 32 and  6%, respectively, of the microscopic count; b. melaninogenicus ssp. intermedius and fusobacterium sp., which averaged 24 and 3%, respectively, of the viable count. one week of metronidazole treatment caused a prompt resolution of clinical symptoms, which coincided with a significant reduction in the plaque proportions  of the treponema sp., b. melaninogenicus ssp., intermedius and fusobacterium sp.  for at least 2 to 3 months following treatment. thus, the same anaerobic species  which were numerically associated with the anug lesion were also selectively reduced in the plaque flora following resolution of the infection. this supports  a role for the above species in the ulcerative stage of the lesion but does not demonstrate that these specific anaerobes initiated the infection. although not confirmed by the data, it was proposed that these particular anaerobic species gained ascendency in the plaque as a result of being selected through the availability of host-derived nutrients in individuals who had undergone certain physiological and psychological stresses.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
