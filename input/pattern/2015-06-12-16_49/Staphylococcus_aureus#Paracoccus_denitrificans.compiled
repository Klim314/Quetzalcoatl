TI  - Chloride dependence of growth in bacteria.
AB  - Chloride is an abundant anion on earth but studies analyzing a possible function  of chloride in prokaryotes are scarce. To address the question, we have tested 44 different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for a chloride dependence or chloride stimulation of growth. None required chloride for growth at their optimal growth (salt) conditions. However, in hyperosmotic media containing high concentrations of Na+, 11 bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Paracoccus denitrificans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Thermus thermophilus, and Vibrio fischeri) had a strict chloride dependence for growth or were significantly stimulated by chloride. These data show that chloride is essential for growth at high salt (Na+) concentrations in various species of the domain Bacteria.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of adenylate kinase from Paracoccus denitrificans and its relationship to mitochondrial and microbial adenylate kinases.
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of adenylate kinase (MgATP + AMP in equilibrium  MgADP + ADP) from Paracoccus denitrificans has been determined. 1. The S-[14C]carboxymethylated protein was cleaved with clostripain, cyanogen bromide and endoproteinase Lys-C; 18, 9 and 6 fragments, respectively, were analyzed. Some of these peptides were further degraded by trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and carboxypeptidases A and B. The fragments were separated by HPLC and sequenced with a gas-phase sequencer. 2. Sequencing the whole unblocked protein yielded the N-terminal region. The C-terminal residues were obtained by carboxypeptidase-Y digestion in agreement with the sequence of tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides. 3. The final sequence shows 217 amino acids with Mr = 23,609 and contains one free cysteine and a disulfide bond. 4. The comparison of the P. denitrificans sequence with other known adenylate kinases shows highest similarity with the structurally known Escherichia coli enzyme (47%). The only and catalytically relevant His in the paracoccal enzyme is close to the site of binding of adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine to E. coli adenylate kinase. The disulfide bridge is located in the 30-residue segment, which is indicative of the large variants and is absent in cytosolic adenylate kinase. The similarity to the mitochondrial intermembrane-space and matrix adenylate kinase isoenzymes is only 40% and 30%, respectively, while 39% of redidues are identical to those of yeast cytosolic adenylate kinase. Therefore, adenylate kinases do not support the hypothesis of a close relationship between Paracoccus and mitochondria.
TI  - Preparation of a one-subunit cytochrome oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans: spectral analysis and enzymatic activity.
AB  - Cytochrome c oxidase was isolated from Paracoccus denitrificans as a two-subunit  enzyme. Chymotrypsin-catalyzed proteolysis reduced the molecular weight of each subunit by about 8000. The spectral properties of this preparation, as well as its Km for cytochrome c(1.7 muM), remained unchanged with respect to the native enzyme. Vmax was reduced by about 55% when assayed in Triton X-100 or in Triton X-100 supplemented with asolectin. Following further proteolysis by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, subunit I remained unchanged as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas subunit II was split into small peptides. These were removed by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. The one-subunit enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 43,000. The reduction of molecular weight was also confirmed by the diminution of the ultraviolet/Soret absorption ratio. This value was 1.8-2.1 for the native enzyme and 1.3-1.5 for the one-subunit enzyme. The spectral properties (including the spectrum CO reduced minus reduced) were not modified by the proteolytic treatment, indicating that cytochromes a and a3 were present in equal amounts. The lack of spectral alteration and the known close association of the copper B atom with cytochrome a3 suggest that copper B is also contained within the one-subunit enzyme. The Km of the one-subunit oxidase was similar to that of the two-subunit enzyme; Vmax was decreased by about 50%. The activity of the one-subunit oxidase had a salt-dependent maximum at 30 mM KCl, almost identical with that of the undigested enzyme, and was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of KCN.
TI  - Cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans: both hemes are located in subunit I.
AB  - The two-subunit cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans has been sequentially digested with chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The smaller subunit of the enzyme (apparent Mr 32,000) was split into numerous peptides that were removed by anion-exchange HPLC. The larger subunit was only digested to a limited extent (from an apparent Mr 45,000 to Mr 43,000), and the spectral properties were preserved relative to the native enzyme (a reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum with maxima at 447 and 607 nm in the Soret and alpha region, respectively). As judged from CO-reduced spectra this proteolytically digested, one-fragment oxidase was found to contain an equal amount of cytochromes a and a3. The enzymatic activity with reduced cytochrome c as substrate in the presence of Triton X-100 proceeded with equal affinity (apparent Km = 0.5-1.0 microM) and with a Vmax of approximately 20% (40 s-1) of that found with the native enzyme (200 s-1). When the assay system was supplemented with soybean phospholipids, the Km became 2 microM for both enzymes and the Vmax became 730 and 170 s-1 for the native and the digested enzyme, respectively. Thus subunit I of P. denitrificans oxidase, and most probably of the other cytochrome c oxidases as well, contains both hemes and at least one Cu atom and has significant enzymatic activity.
