TI  == ecdysone mediates the development of immunity in the drosophila embryo.
AB  == beyond their role in cell metabolism, development, and reproduction, hormones are also important modulators of the immune system. in the context of inflammatory disorders, systemic administration of pharmacological doses of synthetic glucocorticoids (gcs) is widely used as an anti-inflammatory treatment [1, 2]. however, not all actions of gcs are immunosuppressive, and many studies have suggested that physiological concentrations of gcs can have immunoenhancing effects [3-7]. for a more comprehensive understanding of how steroid hormones regulate immunity and inflammation, a simple in vivo system is required. the drosophila embryo has recently emerged as a powerful model system to study the recruitment of immune cells to sterile wounds [8] and host-pathogen dynamics [9]. here we investigate the immune response of the fly embryo to bacterial infections and find that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-he) can regulate the quality of the immune response and influence the resolution of infection in drosophila embryos.

TI  == study of antibacterial activity by capillary electrophoresis using multiple uv detection points.
AB  == a new methodology for an antibacterial assay based on capillary electrophoresis with multiple uv detection points has been proposed. the possible antibacterial activity of cationic molecules on bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative) is studied by detecting the bacteria before, during, and after their meeting with the cationic antibacterial compound. for that, a uv area imaging detector having  two loops and three detection windows was used with a 95 cm x100 mum i.d. capillary. in the antibacterial assay, the bacteria (negatively charged) and the  cationic molecules were injected separately from each end of the capillary. the bacteria were mobilized by anionic itp mode while cationic molecules migrate in the opposite direction under conditions close to cze. the cationic molecules were injected into the capillary as a broad band (injected volume about 16% of the volume of the capillary) to prevent dilution of the sample during the electrophoretic process. bacteriolytic activity, as well as strong interactions between the small antibacterial molecules and the bacteria, can be investigated within a few minutes. the assay was used to study the antibacterial activity of dendrigraft poly-l-lysines on micrococcus luteus and erwinia carotovora. because  dendrigraft poly-l-lysines are nonimmunogenic and have low toxicity, this new class of dendritic biomacromolecules is very promising for antibacterial applications.

TI  == antiviral immunity in drosophila requires systemic rna interference spread.
AB  == multicellular organisms evolved sophisticated defence systems to confer protection against pathogens. an important characteristic of these immune systems is their ability to act both locally at the site of infection and at distal uninfected locations. in insects, such as drosophila melanogaster, rna interference (rnai) mediates antiviral immunity. however, the antiviral rnai defence in flies seems to be a local, cell-autonomous process, as flies are thought to be unable to generate a systemic rnai response. here we show that a recently defined double-stranded rna (dsrna) uptake pathway is essential for effective antiviral rnai immunity in adult flies. mutant flies defective in this  dsrna uptake pathway were hypersensitive to infection with drosophila c virus and sindbis virus. mortality in dsrna-uptake-defective flies was accompanied by 100-to 10(5)-fold increases in viral titres and higher levels of viral rna. furthermore, inoculating naked dsrna into flies elicited a sequence-specific antiviral immune response that required an intact dsrna uptake pathway. these findings suggest that spread of dsrna to uninfected sites is essential for effective antiviral immunity. notably, infection with green fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged sindbis virus suppressed expression of host-encoded gfp at a distal  site. thus, similar to protein-based immunity in vertebrates, the antiviral rnai  response in flies also relies on the systemic spread of a virus-specific immunity signal.
