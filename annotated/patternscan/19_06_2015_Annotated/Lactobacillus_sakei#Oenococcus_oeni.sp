TI  == heterologous expression of oenococcus oeni malolactic enzyme in lactobacillus plantarum for improved malolactic fermentation.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum is involved in a multitude of food related industrial fermentation processes including the malolactic fermentation (mlf) of wine. this  work is the first report on a recombinant l. plantarum strain successfully conducting mlf. the malolactic enzyme (mle) from oenococcus oeni was cloned into  the lactobacillal expression vector psip409 which is based on the sakacin p operon of lactobacillus sakei and expressed in the host strain l. plantarum wcfs1. both recombinant and wild-type l. plantarum strains were tested for mlf using a buffered malic acid solution in absence of glucose. under the conditions  with l-malic acid as the only energy source and in presence of mn2+ and nad+, the recombinant l. plantarum and the wild-type strain converted 85% (2.5 g/l) and 51% (1.5 g/l), respectively, of l-malic acid in 3.5 days. furthermore, the recombinant l. plantarum cells converted in a modified wine 15% (0.4 g/l) of initial l-malic acid concentration in 2 days. in conclusion, recombinant l. plantarum cells expressing mle accelerate the malolactic fermentation.

TI  == analysis of a 30 kbp plasmid encoding histidine decarboxylase gene in tetragenococcus halophilus isolated from fish sauce.
AB  == in order to analyze the genes related to the histamine production, a strain of histamine producing halophilic bacteria, referred to as strain h, was isolated using enrichment culture and dilution-to-extinction methods with histidine broth  inoculated from the fish sauce mashes. the two japanese fish sauce mashes used, accumulate over 1000 mg/l of histamine. phenotypic and 16 s rrna gene sequence analyses identified strain h as tetragenococcus halophilus, the predominant histamine producing bacteria present during fish sauce fermentation. genetic analyses (pcr and southern blot) of the histamine producing strain confirmed that the strain harbored a 30 kbp plasmid (phdc) encoding a single copy of the pyruvoyl dependent histidine decarboxylase gene (hdc). a comparison of hdca that  is a structural gene of histidine decarboxylase among strain h, lactobacillus hilgardii 0006, l. sakei lth2076, oenococcus oeni 9204, t. halophilus and t. muriaticus jcm10006 (t) indicated >99% sequence similarity. the hdc gene cluster  consisted of 4 orfs, hdcp, hdca, hdcb, and hdcrs, and were almost identical to that of l. hilgardii 0006 with 99% sequence similarity including the structural hdc spacer region. however, the approximately 500 bp regions upstream and downstream of the hdc gene were different between that of strain h and l. hilgardii 0006. the complete sequence of phdc revealed 29,924 nucleotides including 28 orfs, two pairs of ir (inverted repeat), similar sequence of plasmid conjugative elements, and a theta-type replicon. these results suggested that hdc could be encoded on transformable elements among lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == characterization of islpl4, a functional insertion sequence in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a lactobacillus plantarum strain, cect 4645, was found to have insertions of a sequence (985 bp in length) at least in eight loci in its genome. the prototype copy (lp1) of this insertion sequence (named islpl4) has one open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 292 amino acids in length with significant levels of similarity with is982 family transposases. perfect 16-bp inverted repeats were found at its termini. upon transposition, generates 8-bp direct repeats of the target sequence, but no consensus sequences could be identified at either insertion site. the islpl4 pattern changed over many generations on the cect 4645 strain. this finding strongly supports our hypothesis that islpl4 is a  functional element in l. plantarum. some of these elements may be cryptic, since  point mutation or 1-nucleotide deletions were found in their transposase encoding genes. islpl4 copies have been detected in leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus  oeni, and lactobacillus sakei. an islpl4 copy of o. oeni contained a +1 nucleotide insertion on its transposase encoding gene and, by using an experimental system, we were able to demonstrate that this specific sequence originates a +1 programmed translational frameshifting. although the frameshifting process reported here operates at a low rate, this description might represent the first case of a functional +1 frameshifting among is.
