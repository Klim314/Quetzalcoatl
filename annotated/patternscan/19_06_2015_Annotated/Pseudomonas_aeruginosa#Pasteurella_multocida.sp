TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  == in this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin,  which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. most of the bacteria tested  (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, pasteurella multocida and bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin mic(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. solely proteus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher mic(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. only six (3.4%) of 177 s. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 e. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin mics of >/= 2 mug/ml. analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in gyra that resulted in amino acid exchanges s83l+d87n or s83l+d87y and single or double mutations in parc that resulted in amino acid exchanges s80i or s80i+e84g  in all 12 e. coli isolates. the six s. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino  acid exchanges s84l or e88k in gyra and s80i in grla. comparative analysis of the mics of pradofloxacin and the mics determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens s. pseudintermedius, e. coli and p. multocida. this comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin mics were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.

TI  == influence of methylation on the antibacterial properties of triclosan in pasteurella multocida and pseudomonas aeruginosa variant strains.
AB  == the opportunistic bacterium pasteurella multocida is extremely susceptible to the hydrophobic biocide triclosan by virtue of its markedly permeable outer membrane, while the nosocomial pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant to levels far exceeding the triclosan aqueous solubility limit. widespread incorporation of triclosan in health and personal care products has resulted in its concomitant accumulation with metabolites such as methyl triclosan in environmental and biological systems. the present study was undertaken to investigate the possibility that methylation of triclosan may mitigate its antiseptic efficacy in healthcare settings, as well as represent a potential resistance mechanism. comparative standardised disc agar diffusion and batch cultural turbidimetric bioassays were employed to assess the relationship between triclosan-susceptible or -resistant bacteria and methyl triclosan. a wild-type p. aeruginosa parental strain and a mutant exhibiting a permeable outer cell envelope phenotype were examined in concert with a refractory wild-type strain sensitised to triclosan susceptibility using outer membrane permeabiliser compound 48/80. all organisms examined were resistant to methyl triclosan, and all organisms excluding p. aeruginosa were susceptible to triclosan over a wide concentration range. the permeable outer membrane phenotype in both mutant and chemically sensitised wild-type strains rendered p. aeruginosa susceptible to triclosan, but not to methyl triclosan. these data support the notion that methylation of triclosan renders the compound unable to inhibit the growth of disparate bacterial pathogens in a manner independent of an intact outer membrane. it can also be concluded that biocide modification may contribute to the intrinsic resistance of p. aeruginosa to triclosan.

TI  == recurrent infective endocarditis with uncommon gram-negative pasteurella multocida and pseudomonas aeruginosa: a case report.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) due to gram-negative bacteria is a rare occurrence, with a relative frequency of less than 10% compared to that caused by gram-positive bacteria. herein is presented the fatal case of a 66-year-old man who had undergone mechanical aortic valve replacement 10 years previously, and developed aortic valve ie after sepsis with pasteurella multocida caused by a cat bite at the left medial ankle. in addition, the patient suffered five months later from mitral and aortic valve endocarditis caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. recurrent surgical therapy was mandatory. this unique case of recurrent gram-negative ie shows that the condition must still be regarded as complex and often fatal, despite adequate medical and surgical treatment.

TI  == usage of antimicrobials and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria from mink.
AB  == the usage of antimicrobials for treatment of mink and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among the most important bacterial pathogens in mink was investigated. the aim of the study was to provide data, which may serve as a basis for the formulation of recommendations for prudent use of antimicrobials for mink. a total of 164 haemolytic staphylococci, 49 haemolytic streptococci, 39 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 pasteurella multocida, and 1093 escherichia coli isolates from danish mink were included in the study. a high frequency of resistance among s. intermedius was found for tetracyclines (54.7%), followed by  penicillin (21.7%), lincosamides (20.4%), macrolides (19.1%), and spectinomycin (18.5%). very low frequencies of resistance were recorded for other antimicrobials. the highest frequency among the e. coli isolates was recorded for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines, whereas resistance to other antimicrobials was rare. all p. aeruginosa were sensitive to gentamicin and colistin and sensitive or intermediate to enrofloxacin, whereas most isolates were resistant to all other antimicrobials. all p. multocida and haemolytic streptococci were sensitive to penicillin. there was a steady increase in the use of antimicrobials during the period 2001-2006, the majority of the prescribed amount being extended spectrum penicillins followed by aminoglycosides, sulphonamides with trimethoprim, and macrolides.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == quantitative resistance level (mic) of bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus) isolated from chickens and turkeys: national resistance monitoring by the bvl 2004/2005.
AB  == in the study 2004/2005, the current quantitative resistance level of escherichia  coli, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp. and staphylococcus aureus from chickens and turkeys was determined for the first time within the framework of the national resistance monitoring of the federal office  of consumer protection and food safety (bvl). the objective was to implement a valid database on the basis of which the development and spread of resistance can be evaluated and monitored. during the investigation period from january 2004 to  february 2005,927 strains were collected and 857 (92%) bacteria strains which corresponded to the specifications of the study protocol were tested with the broth microdilution method to determine the in vitro susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration) to 22 to 28 antimicrobial agents or antibiotic combinations. the results document a prevalence of resistance that exceeds that of bacterial pathogens of other animal species, especially in the case of tetracycline. apart for s. aureus, clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones can still be considered low in poultry pathogens (e. coli approx. 2%). by applying the micg of 4 mg/l for enrofloxacin, a susceptibility of approximately 78 % was calculated for s. aureus. a comparison of the prevalence of resistance between chickens and turkeys, showed that a slightly higher prevalence of resistance can  be expected in turkeys. differences between the susceptibility data of chicks and adult animals could only be found in turkeys. in the case of e. coli, the prevalence of resistance of strains isolated from adult turkeys was up to 10% higher than those isolated from chicks for the corresponding antimicrobial agents. it must be pointed out that the number of e. coli strains from adult turkeys was much higher (n = 194) than the number from turkey chicks (n = 21). the results indicate clearly that in a resistance monitoring system it is necessary to categorise poultry by animal species (chicken, turkey) as well as by production stage and type (broiler, laying hen), so that the epidemiology of resistance can be correctly represented and evaluated. this information is the basis for the development of long-term management options for minimizing antibiotic resistance. furthermore, the knowledge of prevailing resistance levels in germany is a valuable tool for veterinary practitioners when determining an empirical therapy. the data collected by the bvl make an important contribution to the optimisation of the safety of food from animals, and thus to improving consumer protection.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial pathogens against lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin g/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin g/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) as determined in the bft-germvet monitoring program 2004-2006.
AB  == a total of 368 bacterial pathogens, including 72 coagulase-positive and coagulase-variable staphylococci, 97 beta-haemolytic streptococci, 51 escherichia coli, 75 pasteurella multocida, 25 mannheimia haemolytica, 25 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 23 arcanobacterium pyogenes, were investigated for their susceptibility to the three combinations of antimicrobial agents lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin g/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin g/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) in comparison to their susceptibility to the corresponding single substances. when comparing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined for any of the three combinations with those for the single substances, the lowest mic of one of the two substances usually determined the mic of the combination.this observation was made for all three combinations and all bacterial pathogens tested.thus, it is assumed that the combination of lincomycin with spectinomycin as well as that of penicillin with either neomycin or dihydrostreptomycin resulted in an extended spectrum of target bacterial pathogens rather than in an increase in antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == a multidomain outer membrane protein from pasteurella multocida: modelling and simulation studies of pmompa.
AB  == pmompa is a two-domain outer membrane protein from pasteurella multocida. the n-terminal domain of pmompa is a homologue of the transmembrane beta-barrel domain of ompa from escherichia coli, whilst the c-terminal domain of pmompa is a homologue of the extra-membrane neisseria meningitidis rmpm c-terminal domain. this enables a model of a complete two domain pmompa to be constructed and its conformational dynamics explored via md simulations of the protein embedded within two different phospholipid bilayers (dmpc and dmpe). the conformational stability of the transmembrane beta-barrel is similar to that of a homology model of oprf from pseudomonas aeruginosa in bilayer simulations. there is a degree of  water penetration into the interior of the beta-barrel, suggestive of a possible  transmembrane pore. although the pmompa model is stable over 20 ns simulations, retaining its secondary structure and fold integrity throughout, substantial flexibility is observed in a short linker region between the n- and the c-terminal domains. at low ionic strength, the c-terminal domain moves to interact electrostatically with the lipid bilayer headgroups. this study demonstrates that computational approaches may be applied to more complex, multi-domain outer membrane proteins, rather than just to transmembrane beta-barrels, opening the possibility of in silico proteomics approaches to such  proteins.

TI  == occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from diagnostic samples from dogs.
AB  == objectives: to study the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens from dogs and relate resistance patterns to data on consumption of antimicrobials. methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 201 staphylococcus intermedius, 37 streptococcus canis, 39 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 pasteurella multocida, 29 proteus spp. and 449 escherichia coli isolates from clinical submissions from dogs were determined by a broth-dilution  method for determination of minimal inhibitory concentration. data for consumption of antimicrobials were retrieved from vetstat, a national database for reporting antimicrobial prescriptions. results: the majority of the antimicrobials prescribed for dogs were broad-spectrum compounds, and extended-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins and sulphonamides + trimethoprim together accounted for 81% of the total amount used for companion animals. resistance to cephalosporins and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid was very low for all bacterial species examined, except for p. aeruginosa, and resistance to sulphonamides and trimethoprim was low for most species. among the s. intermedius isolates, 60.2% were resistant to penicillin, 30.2% to fusidic acid and 27.9% to  macrolides. among e. coli isolates, the highest level of resistance was recorded  for ampicillin, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, tetracyclines and streptomycin. certain differences in resistance patterns between isolates from different sites  or organs were noticed for e. coli, s. intermedius and proteus isolates. conclusions: this investigation provided data on occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in important pathogenic bacteria from dogs, which may be useful for the small animal practitioner. resistance was low to the compounds that were most often used, but unfortunately, these compounds were broad-spectrum. data on resistance and usage may form a background for the establishment of a set of recommendations for prudent use of antimicrobials for companion animals.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == ompa: gating and dynamics via molecular dynamics simulations.
AB  == outer membrane proteins (omps) of gram-negative bacteria have a variety of functions including passive transport, active transport, catalysis, pathogenesis  and signal transduction. whilst the structures of approximately 25 omps are currently known, there is relatively little known about their dynamics in different environments. the outer membrane protein, ompa from escherichia coli has been studied extensively in different environments both experimentally and computationally, and thus provides an ideal test case for the study of the dynamics and environmental interactions of outer membrane proteins. we review molecular dynamics simulations of ompa and its homologues in a variety of different environments and discuss possible mechanisms of pore gating. the transmembrane domain of e. coli ompa shows subtle differences in dynamics and interactions between a detergent micelle and a lipid bilayer environment. simulations of the crystallographic unit cell reveal a micelle-like network of detergent molecules interacting with the protein monomers. simulation and modelling studies emphasise the role of an electrostatic-switch mechanism in the  pore-gating mechanism. simulation studies have been extended to comparative models of ompa homologues from pseudomonas aeruginosa (oprf) and pasteurella multocida (pmompa), the latter model including the periplasmic c-terminal domain.

TI  == outer membrane permeability for nonpolar antimicrobial agents underlies extreme susceptibility of pasteurella multocida to the hydrophobic biocide triclosan.
AB  == pasteurella multocida exhibits nonspecific susceptibility to nonpolar antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, despite possessing an ultrastructurally typical gram-negative cell envelope. capsulated and noncapsulated cell surface variants were examined to investigate the role outer membrane permeability plays  in triclosan susceptibility. test strains were unable to initiate growth in the presence of bile salts and were susceptible to triclosan with minimal inhibitory  concentrations (mics) ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml. disk agar diffusion bioassays revealed triclosan susceptibility to be dose dependent and all strains  were susceptible to the hydrophobic antibiotics novobiocin, rifamycin sv, and chloramphenicol. triclosan minimal bactericidal concentrations were greater than  mics, thereby suggesting that dose dependency reflected both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. total and viable cell density growth kinetic determinations revealed a triclosan concentration of 2.0 microg/ml resulted in loss of batch culture viability within 4-24 h. concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 microg/ml exerted either a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect depending on the strain. uptake of the hydrophobic probe 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine was greater in p. multocida strains than refractory control organisms pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli thereby suggesting the presence of phospholipid bilayer regions in the outer membrane. because triclosan inhibits a conserved enoyl-acp reductase necessary for bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis, these data support the notion that extreme susceptibility in p. multocida is due to the general inability of the outer membrane to exclude nonpolar compounds. moreover, susceptibility is independent of the presence of capsular material and the biocide is bactericidal in a concentration dependent manner.

TI  == prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

TI  == a seven-year survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of pathogenic strains isolated from pets.
AB  == this study, vetoquinol s.a. epidemiosurveillance, was conducted from 1994 to 2001 in order to determine the susceptibility (by mic determination) to marbofloxacin  (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains from infected pets originated from six european countries. isolates were collected from urinary infections (escherichia coli), respiratory infections (pasteurella multocida), dermatological infections (staphylococcus intermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and otitis (s. intermedius, p. aeruginosa).  the mic distribution for each species was the same both before and after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1995. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin; this resistance was induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period, there was no significant evolution of mic(90) for any bacterial species studied and no  development of resistance was observed. marbofloxacin was the most active antibiotic against p. multocida isolates and had the lowest mic. no difference in mic distribution was seen between the s. intermedius (unimodal distribution) isolated from dermatological infections and those from otitis. this was also true for p. aeruginosa. the use of marbofloxacin was not found to have induced a significant increase or spread of resistant bacteria.

TI  == microbial contamination of dialysate and its prevention in haemodialysis units.
AB  == at the haemodialysis centres of nine hospitals in japan, microbial contamination  of treated water (reverse osmosis method), acid and bicarbonate concentrates, and dialysate was investigated. among these fluids used in haemodialysis, the dialysate was most frequently contaminated and had the highest concentration of bacteria. of 40 dialysate samples analysed, 42.5% showed a bacterial count of more than 2000cfu/ml, which was above the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation (aami) standard. however, among the 40 samples from 20 dialysis machines, all six dialysate samples from three dialysis machines that used an ultrafiltration membrane in the circuit before the entrance of the dialysate into the dialyser, showed a bacterial count of < or =10 cfu/ml. in addition, when an ultrafiltration membrane was used in the circuit before the entrance of the dialysate into the dialyser for four dialysis machines showing dialysate samples contaminated with 10(4)-10(5)cfu/ml the bacterial count in dialysate samples from these machines became zero. because dialysis machines are  susceptible to microbial contamination, it is necessary to take measures such as  placing an ultrafiltration membrane into the circuit before the entrance of dialysate into the dialyser.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == infectious agents associated with rabbit pneumonia: isolation of amyxomatous myxoma virus strains.
AB  == sixty-six rabbits, with no history of vaccination against myxomatosis and which had died of pulmonary lesions, were submitted for virological and serological tests for myxoma virus (mv) infection and for bacteriological examinations. at post mortem, the diagnoses based on observed lesions were as follows: acute haemorrhagic pneumonia (38%); acute suppurative bronchopneumonia (35%); and fibrinohaemorrhagic bronchopneumonia with fibrinous pleuritis (27%). mv was isolated from 10% of the rabbits, mainly from those with acute haemorrhagic pneumonia. serological evidence of mv infection was demonstrated in 44% of rabbits. pathogenic bacteria species isolated from lungs were pasteurella (spp. and multocida), escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, from 41, 11, 7 and 6% of samples. no relationship could be established between the presence of specific antibodies to mv and the observed pulmonary lesions or the results of the bacteriological examinations. a significant trend was established between the severity of the lesions and the results of the bacteriological examinations.

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

TI  == targeting lurking pathogens in acute traumatic and chronic wounds.
AB  == the appropriate antimicrobial treatment for skin and soft tissue following acute  trauma is determined by the mechanism of injury, time from injury to treatment, environmental wound contamination, pathogenicity of colonizing bacteria, and patient-specific issues. these factors can be used to predict the risk of secondary infection of wounds. although common skin pathogens (such as staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus) cause most secondary wound infections, antibiotic therapy sometimes must be directed against unusual pathogens that are associated with atypical wounds, such as animal bites (amoxicillin with clavulanate for pasteurella multocida) and plantar puncture wounds (ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa). this customized treatment approach is also appropriate for chronic wounds, such as pressure and diabetic foot ulcers. in addition to antibiotic therapy, wound management may include surgical debridement. active areas of investigation in wound management include the use of growth factors and hyperbaric oxygen.

AB  == septic arthritis of the hand and wrist is relatively uncommon. the most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a human or animal bite. the most common causative organism is staphylococcus aureus. septic arthritis caused by streptococcal species. haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia species, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pasteurella multocida, eikenella corrodens, and mycobacterium marinum also may occur in specific clinical settings. the best clinical results occur following an accurate diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage, and debridement in concert with appropriate antibiotics and early postoperative range of motion. a delay in diagnosis or treatment is associated with an unsatisfactory outcome.

TI  == two-color hybridization assay for simultaneous detection of bordetella bronchiseptica and toxigenic pasteurella multocida from swine.
AB  == bordetella bronchiseptica and toxigenic pasteurella multocida are the etiologic agents of swine atrophic rhinitis. methods currently used for their identification are time-consuming and suffer from a lack of sensitivity. we describe a colony lift-hybridization assay for detection of b. bronchiseptica and toxigenic p. multocida that can be performed with a single colony lift derived from a primary isolation plate without the need for pure subcultures of suspect bacteria. membranes are hybridized simultaneously to probes derived from the b. bronchiseptica alca gene and the p. multocida toxa gene. a multicolor development procedure permits sequential detection of bound probes. the assay was tested with 84 primary isolation plates generated from nasal swabs from swine with clinical signs of atrophic rhinitis. comparison of the results from the colony lift-hybridization assay with those from conventional testing, based on a combination of colony morphology, biochemical reactions, mouse lethality, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indicated that the colony lift assay has superior sensitivity and comparable specificity. this technique has wide application for diagnostic and experimental studies.

TI  == evaluation of a computerized antimicrobial susceptibility system with bacteria isolated from animals.
AB  == the biomic is a computerized system used to calculate the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of an antimicrobial agent from a zone of inhibition generated by a disk diffusion test. this system was developed using bacterial pathogens of  human origin. this study investigated the use of the biomic system for determining mics for bacterial pathogens from animals. the mics generated by the  biomic system were compared with the mics generated using a broth microdilution testing method. a total of 663 drug-organism combinations was tested. these combinations included 3 species of gram-positive bacteria, 5 species of gram-negative bacteria, and the antimicrobial agents ampicillin, gentamicin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and erythromycin. overall, the mics generated by the biomic system  correlated with the broth microdilution mics for 72% of the total drug-organism combinations tested. the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains tested showed the highest agreement between the 2 systems, with 100% for all antibacterial agents tested, whereas pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and enterococci showed the least agreement (76%, 57%, and 47%, respectively). among these organisms, trimethoprim-sulfa showed the least agreement (31%) and ciprofloxacin showed the  greatest (91%). these results indicate that the biomic system could be a useful tool in veterinary medicine for producing quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility results. however, it is currently unreliable for some drug-bacteria combinations. this discrepancy possibly could be corrected by modification of the software using data points generated by a large-scale study.

TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.

TI  == effect of polymyxin b nonapeptide on daptomycin permeability and cell surface properties in pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == the present study was carried out to determine if sensitization of gram-negative  bacteria to the polyanionic antibiotic daptomycin by cationic molecules can be explained on the basis of decreased cell surface charge in order to better understand intrinsic resistance. turbidimetric assessments of batch cultural growth kinetics revealed the outer membrane permeabilizer polymyxin b nonapeptide sensitized pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli to the hydrophobic probe novobiocin, whereas little or no sensitization was observed for two surface hydrophobicity variants of pasteurella multocida. polymyxin b nonapeptide and daptomycin synergistically inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa only. a hydrocarbon  adherence assay revealed permeabilizing concentrations of polymyxin b nonapeptide increased cell surface hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa and the hydrophobic p. multocida variant, while e. coli and the hydrophilic p. multocida variant remained unaffected. measurement of cellular electrophoretic mobility showed polymyxin b nonapeptide permeabilization of p. aeruginosa to daptomycin occurred  concomitantly with a significant decrease in cell surface charge, while no such sensitization occurred in organisms which failed to undergo polymyxin b nonapeptide-induced surface charge decreases. these data suggest that sensitization of gram-negative bacteria to polyanionic lipopeptides by growth in  the presence of polycationic outer membrane permeabilizers such as polymyxin b nonapeptide is dependent on diminution of overall cell surface charge and polarity, thereby allowing outer cell envelope permeation.

TI  == differentiation of toxigenic from nontoxigenic isolates of pasteurella multocida  by pcr.
AB  == a pcr assay was developed for the differentiation of toxigenic pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida strains, the major etiologic agent for progressive atrophic rhinitis in pigs, from nontoxigenic strains. the pcr targeted a toxa gene encoding a 143-kda dermonecrotic toxin that is considered to be the central  etiologic factor in progressive atrophic rhinitis. toxa fragments were amplified  from toxigenic p. multocida isolates but not from nontoxigenic isolates or other  bacteria isolated from pigs. the sensitivity of the reaction was as low as 10 pg  of chromosomal dna from a toxigenic strain. the results obtained by pcr of the dnas of 187 field isolates of p. multocida were consistent with those obtained by the guinea pig skin test and western blot (immunoblot) analysis. restriction fragment analysis of the pcr-amplified fragments from 67 field isolates and comparison of the dna sequences of fragments from capsular serotype a and d strains suggest that the pcr-amplified region, which is considered to encode the  major immunologic determinants of the toxin, would be the same among p. multocida strains. the pcr that we describe should be useful for the diagnosis and the etiologic survey of progressive atrophic rhinitis.

TI  == ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae by normal serum.
AB  == pulmonary surfactant has been shown to play an increasingly important role in bacterial clearance at the alveolar surface in the lung. this study describes a bactericidal mechanism in which ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica by normal serum. to demonstrate killing, six bacterial species were incubated first with pulmonary surfactant for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then with serum for an additional 60 min at 37 degrees c. p. haemolytica type a1 strains 82-25 and l101, a p. haemolytica type 2 strain, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible and pasteurella multocida, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible to killing by ovine pulmonary surfactant and normal serum. no bacteria incubated with bovine pulmonary surfactant were killed by normal serum. although the species origin of  pulmonary surfactant was selective, the species origin of serum was not. p. haemolytica incubated with ovine pulmonary surfactant was killed by fetal calf serum, gnotobiotic calf serum, pooled normal sheep serum, pooled normal rabbit serum, and pooled guinea pig serum. ultrastructurally, killed p. haemolytica suspensions contained dead cells and cells distorted with vacuoles between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. the mechanism of killing did not correlate with concentrations of complement or lysozyme or titers of residual antibody in either the pulmonary surfactant or the serum, and killing was reduced by preincubation of surfactant with p. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide. preliminary characterization of both surfactant and serum implicate a low-molecular-weight proteinaceous component in the surfactant and serum albumin  in the serum. this mechanism may help clear certain gram-negative bacteria from the lungs of sheep as a part of the pulmonary innate defense system.

TI  == leishmania major: bacterial contamination of cutaneous lesions in experimental animals.
AB  == no bacterial contamination has been demonstrated in cutaneous leishmaniasis (cl)  nodule and in lesions caused by leishmania major in balb/c mice up to 20 days after infection. however, although many phagocytic cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) were present in the cl lesion, 80% of the lesions showed bacterial contamination that developed within the first 70 days of infection. topical treatment of the lesion with an ointment containing 15% paromomycin and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin for 20 days eliminated all the leishmania parasites and several of the associated bacteria including: proteus vulgaris, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus albus and staphylococcus aureus. this treatment did not affect escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. total elimination of these bacteria was achieved only during the healing process, and within 20 days following termination of treatment. the rate of disappearance of bacteria inoculated alone  into the base of the tail of normal uninfected balb/c mice was much faster than that of bacteria inoculated into either the cl nodule or the cl lesion. this study suggests the development of local immunosuppression in the cl lesion that may be mediated by the leishmania parasites and their metabolites.

TI  == susceptibility to hydrophobic molecules and phospholipid composition in pasteurella multocida and actinobacillus lignieresii.
AB  == despite its typically gram-negative cell envelope ultrastructure, pasteurella multocida is susceptible to the hydrophobic antibiotic novobiocin and is unable to initiate growth on macconkey agar, a parameter often used to effect is differentiation from other members of the family pasteurellaceae such as actinobacillus lignieresii. however, growth on basal medium supplemented with individual selective factors and an agar diffusion assay revealed the bile salts  contained in macconkey agar to be toxic to both organisms. four p. multocida surface hydrophobicity variants exhibited consistent in vitro susceptibility to the hydrophobic antibiotics novobiocin, rifamycin sv, and actinomycin d as determined by broth dilution. readily extractable lipid fractions were obtained by chloroform-methanol extraction of freeze-dried whole cells from exponential-phase cultures. no major differences in total cellular readily extractable lipid content were observed among the p. multocida and a. lignieresii strains examined, although hydrophobic p. multocida strains appeared to contain slightly more than did hydrophilic strains. analytical thin-layer chromatography  and quantitation of resolved readily extractable lipid components revealed the major cell envelope phospholipids of both organisms to be phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol in a molar ratio of approximately 4:1 regardless of cell surface hydrophobicity properties. similar results were obtained for pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is notably refractory to  hydrophobic molecules. these data support the conclusion that the permeability of the p. multocida cell envelope to structurally unrelated, hydrophobic molecules is not dependent on cell surface hydrophobicity and cannot be explained on the basis of anomalous polar lipid composition.

TI  == [intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  == bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. the following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with  diseases or died: escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); vibrio genitalis (3.86%); streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); proteus sp. (1.62%); staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); pasteurella multocida (0.11%). the serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. the tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. there were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == use of the api 20e system to identify non-enterobacteriaceae from veterinary medical sources.
AB  == the capability of the api 20e system to identify gram-negative nonfermenters and  nonenteric fermenters was evaluated for 272 isolates from veterinary sources. two different methods were used for interpreting the carbohydrate fermentation reactions on the strip. in method i, weakly fermented (yellow-green) carbohydrates were considered positive for all oxidase-positive organisms, and in method ii, yellow-green carbohydrates were considered positive for all organisms  requiring incubation for 48 hours. by both methods, the api system correctly identified 62% of the isolates. with method i, 31% of the isolates were misidentified and 6% were not identified. with method ii, 21% of the isolates were misidentified and 17% received no identification. organisms most affected by these 2 methods of interpretation were pasteurella and actinobacillus. identifications reached by the api system were also compared with identifications made by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. the frequency of identifications agreements was not significantly affected by the method of api carbohydrate fermentation reaction interpretation. generally, 30% of the identifications agreed (diagnostic laboratories vs api) when using only the api index, whereas 51% agreed when the entire api computer data base identifications were included.  the type of identification disagreements between diagnostic laboratories and the  api system, however, was significantly affected by the method of api strip interpretation. with method i, 42% of the identifications were different and 6% were not in the api data base. with method ii, 33% of the identifications were different and 17% were not in the api data base. biotype differences between human and veterinary isolates were also compared. significant differences between the predicted and actual reactions were noted for pseudomonas aeruginosa and bordetella bronchiseptica; however, these differences did not affect their correct identification to the api index. for pasteurella multocida, most profile  numbers were not listed in the api index because of differences in the actual vs  predicted oxidase and nitrate reduction reactions; however, they were correctly identified with the total computer data base.

TI  == experimental atrophic rhinitis in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  == twenty-nine caesarian derived colostrum deprived germfree pigs were reared in isolators in groups of three to four per isolator. at seven days of age each group was inoculated intranasally with one of four strains of bordetella bronchiseptica (designated b, j, l and 55b), or pseudomonas aeruginosa or a mucoid strain of escherichia coli, all previously isolated from nasal mucus of pigs affected with clinical atrophic rhinitis. another group was inoculated simultaneously with b. bronchiseptica b and pasteurella multocida. the animals were observed for clinical signs of atrophic rhinitis and monitored bacteriologically at weekly intervals for seven weeks. then they were bled for serology and killed and their respiratory organs examined for gross and histopathological lesions. all of the pigs inoculated with the bordetellae had inflammation of the nasal mucosa and developed positive serum antibody titers against all four of the bordetella strains used in this study. strain j caused sneezing and turbinate atrophy in three of four pigs. one of the three pigs inoculated with strain l died in ten days from bronchopneumonia and pericarditis  and had turbinate atrophy. strains b and b55 caused no turbinate atrophy, but two out of three pigs inoculated with both b. bronchiseptica b and p. multocida had turbinate atrophy. no nasal lesions were observed in the pigs inoculated with e.  coli or p. aeruginosa or in the noninoculated germfree controls. the results indicate a variation in the ability of different strains of b. bronchiseptica to  cause turbinate atrophy in pigs and demonstrate that nasal infections by these organisms stimulate serum antibody response. presence of p. multocida appears to  increase the severity of the lesions. as the e. coli and pseudomonas failed to produce atrophic rhinitis, they are probably of no significance as primary etiological agents in the atrophic rhinitis syndrome in swine.

TI  == [atrophic rhinitis in swine].
AB  == four 60-day-old pigs were experimentally infected with bordetella bronchiseptica  at a state in which the animals were clinicylly normal. a single pig only, killed on the 180th day, presented a slight deflection of septum nasi. morphologically,  there were severe dystrophic and necrotic changes in the mucosa of the conchae, the nasal cartilages as well as in the bones. the pathogen was reisolated from two of the pigs. clinical and morphological investigations were carried out also  with spontaneously affected animals, isolating pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mycoplasma organisms, but not bordetella bronchiseptic. morphologically, there were in 37 of the pigs severe dystrophic and necrotic lesions in the nasal mucosa, cartilages, and bones. basophilic inclusion bodies were demonstrated in the epithelial cells of the tubulous glands. it is concluded that a combined method of prophylaxis and treatment would be most effective, and  of the drugs borgal has proved likewise most promising.

TI  == comparative clinical pharmacology of amikacin and kanamycin in dairy calves.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of escherichia coli, salmonella sp, pasteurella multocida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from young calves and their environment to kanamycin and its semisynthetic derivative--amikacin, was compared by the tube dilution method. the minimal inhibitory concentration of amikacin was two- to fourfold lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration of  kanamycin for the salmonella group b, ps aeruginosa and p multocida strains examined, whereas the e coli and salmonella group d strains were eqaully susceptible to the 2 antibiotics. the concentrations of amikacin and kanamycin in the serum of calves after single intramuscular injections at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg were determined, and differences between the 2 antibiotics were not observed. intramuscular dosage schedules were calculated, based on the sensitivity of the different bacterial strains and the duration of effective serum drug concentrations.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == [possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  == in the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. as shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (klebsiella ozanae, k. pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus pneumoniae), mycoplasma pneumoniae and m. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (bacillus cereus, brucella abortus, erysipelothrix insidiosa, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, s. typhi). consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the c-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. in modified boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much  less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated  ones (fig. 1).

TI  == [antagonistic action of pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to pasteurella multocida strains].
AB  == studied was the antagonistic action of 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa toward 48 strains of pasteurella multocida. use was made of the method of the delayed antagonism after fredericq. ps. aeruginosa organisms were found to manifest a strongly expressed antagonistic activity as regards p. multocida. all pasteurella strains proved highly sensitive, and showed a zone of inhibited growth sizing from 20 to 70 mm. the antibiotic substance produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms was yielded better on solid nutrient media than in liquid ones. all pseudomonas aeruginosa strains manifested bactericidal and not bacteriostatic action upon the studied strains of pasteurella multocida.

TI  == common enterobacterial antigen in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == production of the common enterobacterial antigen (ca) by strains of yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) serotypes 3 and 9 (winblad), by strains of 5 different y.e. serogroups (wauters) and various other bacteria was examined. antibody against ca was raised by immunization of rabbits with e. coli o 14. extract prepared from s. typhimurium was used for the sensitization of sheep erythrocytes with ca. absorption and haemagglutination inhibition experiments showed that ca could be detected in heat extracts from all y.e. strains examined, and in that from yersinia pseudotuberculosis. ca was not detected in extracts from pasteurella multocida, francisella tularensis, brucella abortus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus  or pseudomonas aeruginosa. anti-ca antibodies could not be demonstrated in serum  from rabbits immunized with y.e. bacteria, but were demonstrated in serum from rabbits immunized with a ca-containing fraction of the y.e. extract. the possibility of participation of anti-ca antibody in indirect haemagglutination tests for detection of antibody to y.e. o antigens is emphasized.

TI  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in brain heart infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. with an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus  aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by e.  coli, p. vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.
