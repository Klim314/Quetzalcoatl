surface-layer protein extracts from lactobacillus helveticus inhibit enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 adhesion to epithelial cells.
adherence of intestinal pathogens, including escherichia coli o157:h7, to human intestinal epithelial cells is a key step in pathogenesis. probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus helveticus r0052 inhibit the adhesion of e. coli o157:h7 to epithelial cells, a process which may be related to specific components of the bacterial surface. surface-layer proteins (slps) are located in a paracrystalline layer outside the bacterial cell wall and are thought to play a role in tissue adherence. however, the ability of s-layer protein extract derived from probiotic bacteria to block adherence of enteric pathogens has not been investigated. human epithelial (hep-2 and t84) cells were treated with s-layer protein extract alone, infected with e. coli o157:h7, or pretreated with s-layer protein extract prior to infection to determine their importance in the inhibition of pathogen adherence. the effects of s-layer protein extracts were characterized by phase-contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance of polarized monolayers. pre-treatment of host epithelial cells with s-layer protein extracts prior to e. coli o157:h7 infection decreased pathogen adherence and attaching-effacing lesions in addition to preserving the barrier function of monolayers. these in vitro studies indicate that a non-viable constituent derived from a probiotic strain may prove effective in interrupting the infectious process of an intestinal pathogen.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
[bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
[sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.
