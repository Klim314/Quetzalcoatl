TI  - Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between lactobacilli isolates from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. Thirty-seven Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth in a microplate assay. Almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the Lactobacillus acidophilus group) and to tetracycline (MIC>/=128 mug/ml). Only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. The transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using L. acidophilus strain 4M14E (EmR), Lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5M14E (CmR), Lactobacillus salivarius strain 5C14C (EmR), and the 4G14L and 3C14C strains of Lactobacillus reuteri (CmR) showed a frequency of approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different combinations. The exception was the L. salivarius 5C14C (EmR) and L. vaginalis 5M14E (CmR) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. In vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating L. acidophilus 4M14E (EmR) with L. reuteri 3C14C (CmR), L. reuteri 4G14L (CmR) or L. vaginalis 5M14E (CmR) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. This possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.
TI  - Acid production and growth by oral Lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of Lactobacillus, representing nine species, including Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. Anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (pH 7.0). Acid production and growth were measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. RESULTS: Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species. They also produced more acid than the others. Lactobacillus vaginalis showed the lowest rate of growth and acid production. These findings demonstrated that the different species of Lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. CONCLUSION: There was variation in acid production and growth between the Lactobacillus species. The strongest acid producers were Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. It seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. These species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. Bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only Bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. Bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against Candida SPP.
AB  - Urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. The treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. In this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against Candida spp. The LAB were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis, adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four Candida species into different degrees; among them L. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. The highest amount of lactic acid was produced by L. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by L. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), L. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and L. jensenii (5.4 g/l). All isolates produced H2O2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, and L. vaginalis. Only L. agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii and L. ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial Caco-2 cells. Among the isolates evaluated, L agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii, and L. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.
TI  - Isolation of lactobacilli with probiotic properties from the human stomach.
AB  - AIMS: Recent evidence suggests that the human gastric microbiota is much more diverse than previously thought. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for isolating lactobacilli from the human stomach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacilli were selectively cultured from gastric biopsies from 12 patients undergoing routine endoscopy. Lactobacilli were present in four of 12 biopsies. We isolated, in total 10 different strains representing five species (Lactobacillus gasseri, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis, L. reuteri and L. salivarius). The 10 isolates varied greatly in their ability to inhibit the growth of two Gram-positive bacteria and two Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the acid and bile resistance profiles of the 10 isolates spanned a wide range. CONCLUSIONS: Five different Lactobacillus species were cultured from human gastric biopsies for the first time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Diverse Lactobacillus species are more prevalent in the human stomach than previously recognized, representing an untapped source of bacteria with beneficial probiotic and/or biotechnological properties.
TI  - Characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. METHODS AND RESULTS: The faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. The Lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. Partial 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphism DNA) profiles to differentiate Lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. Based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. The most numerous Lactobacillus species found in the piglets was Lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). Other lactobacilli were L. salivarius (n = 15), L. agilis (n = 4), L. johnsonii (n = 2), L. vaginalis (n = 1), L. mucosae (n = 1) and L. gallinarum (n = 1). All the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. Two L. salivarius isolates and two L. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the faecal Lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of L. reuteri, L. salivarius and L. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. Most of the Lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Valuable information on Lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.
TI  - Diversity of lactobacilli in the oral cavities of young women with dental caries.
AB  - For nearly a century, lactobacilli (LB) in the oral cavity have been generally associated with dental caries. Here, we characterized the LB isolated from the saliva of 6 women with active caries using genetic-based taxonomical identification methods. From each subject, 30 isolates growing on Rogosa medium and presumed to be LB were analyzed. Of the 180 isolates, 176 were further characterized by biotyping, DNA melting points, DNA chromosomal fingerprinting, genotyping, and phylogenetic cluster assessment. We found a total of 30 unique genotypes of LB in the saliva of caries-active women, with each woman harboring between 2 and 8 distinct genotypes. Although Lactobacillus vaginalis, L. fermentum, and L. salivarius were found in 4 of 6 of the subjects, results from other studies using comparable methods show an entirely different array of LB associated with caries. These collective observations lead us to surmise that LB associated with dental caries are likely exogenous and opportunistic colonizers, arising from food or other reservoirs outside the oral cavity.
TI  - Influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from Gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. The LAB identified by 16S-23S rRNA PCR-ARDRA were mainly of Lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of Enterococcus spp. for all animals. Free-range chickens showed a higher presence of Lactobacillus acidophilus while Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. Lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and Lactobacillus salivarius in both types. Enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. All LAB isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. Animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of LAB from chicken cecum. LAB isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  - Samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. Lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. Fifty-eight Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii spp. lactis, L. crispatus, L. plantarum, L. cellobiosus, L. jensenii, L. salivarius, L. curvatus, L. brevis and L. oris. The inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 Lactobacillus spp. and Candida albicans (AJD 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. Although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on C. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus isolates. The natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.
TI  - Characterization and selection of vaginal Lactobacillus strains for the preparation of vaginal tablets.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize and select Lactobacillus strains for properties that would  make them a good alternative to the use of antibiotics to treat human vaginal infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten Lactobacillus strains belonging to four different Lactobacillus species were analysed for properties relating to mucosal colonization or microbial antagonism (adhesion to human epithelial cells, hydrogen peroxide production, antimicrobial activity towards Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans and coaggregation with pathogens). The involvement of electrostatic interactions and the influence of bacterial metabolic state in the binding of lactobacilli to the cell surface were also studied. Adherence to epithelial cells varied greatly among the Lactobacillus species and among different strains belonging to the same Lactobacillus species. The reduction in surface negative electric charge promoted the binding of several Lactobacillus strains to the cell membrane whereas lyophilization reduced the adhesion capacity of many isolates. The antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli culture supernatant fluids was not directly related to the production of H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: Three strains (Lactobacillus brevis CD2, Lact. salivarius FV2 and Lact. gasseri MB335) showed optimal properties and were, therefore, selected for the preparation of vaginal tablets. The selected strains adhered to epithelial cells displacing vaginal pathogens; they produced high levels of H2O2, coaggregated with pathogens and inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The dosage formulation developed in this study appears to be a good candidate for the probiotic prophylaxis and treatment of human vaginal infections.
