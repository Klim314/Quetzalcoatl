TI  == the 1.25 a resolution structure of the diheme napb subunit of soluble nitrate reductase reveals a novel cytochrome c fold with a stacked heme arrangement.
AB  == the diheme cytochrome napb constitutes the small subunit of a periplasmic nitrate reductase found in a wide variety of bacterial species, including pathogens. the  napb protein is essential in transferring electrons to the large catalytic subunit napa, which subsequently reduces nitrate to nitrite. here we present the  crystal structure of a proteolyzed form of recombinant napb from haemophilus influenzae, which was determined by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion  (mad) method at 1.25 a resolution. this structure shows an unprecedented fold, confirming that napb proteins belong to a new class of cytochromes. the two heme  groups have nearly parallel heme planes and are stacked at van der waals distances with an iron-to-iron distance of only 9.9 a, two structural features that are also present in the split-soret diheme cytochrome c from desulfovibrio desulfuricans atcc 27774, which is otherwise unrelated in the peptide chain folding pattern. the two propionate side chains on both heme groups are hydrogen-bonded to each other, a structural characteristic that to date also has  not been reported in any other heme protein. the propionates of one of the heme groups are pulled toward the interior of the molecule due to a salt bridge and a  number of hydrogen bonds between the propionates and conserved residues. we propose a hypothetical but plausible model of the napab complex in which the four redox centers are positioned in a virtually linear configuration which spans a distance of nearly 40 a, suggesting an efficient pathway for the transfer of electrons from napc, the physiological electron donor of napb, to a nitrate molecule at the catalytic site of napa.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of rabies epizootics in texas.
AB  == background: texas is in the midst of two independent epizootics of rabies, involving coyotes (canis latrans) and domestic dogs (canis familiaris) in southern texas and grey foxes (urocyon cinereoargenteus) in west central texas. the domestic dog/coyote (ddc) and grey for (tf) rabies virus variants cannot be differentiated by antigenic typing with currently available monoclonal antibodies. these two variants also cannot be distinguished from a third variant, sonora dog (sd) rabies, that is not enzootic in texas, but occasionally occurs in animals along the western border with mexico. objectives: to determine a method for the differentiation of the ddc. tf and sd variants, which is essential for epidemiologic monitoring of the oral rabies vaccination program (orvp), a program instituted to control rabies in coyotes and grey foxes in texas. study design: primers complementary to nucleoprotein sequence of either the ddc or tf rabies virus permit specific reverse transcription and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. in addition, general primers, which recognize a broad range of rabies variants, used in conjunction with a restriction digest for the differentiation of ddc, tf of sd rabies virus were investigated. results and conclusions: of 122  specimens tested with specific primers. 111 (91%) were specifically identified as either ddc (33 samples) or tf (78 samples). overly stringent conditions, enzyme inhibitors, or limiting rna may account for the 11 non-amplifications. amplification of rna under less stringent conditions, with primers recognizing a  broad range of rabies variants followed by digestion with either restriction enzyme desulfovibrio desulfuricans i (dde i) or haemophilus influenzae rf. (hinfi), was used to identify the 11 isolates that did not amplify with specific  primers (6 ddc, 4 tf and 1 sd). in addition to these 11 isolates, the less stringent method of amplification, followed by enzyme digestion has identified a  total of 125 additional specimens (26 ddc, 94 tf and 5 sd) that were not tested by variant-specific amplification. these data provide a means to track the spread of the different rabies virus variants and allow the orvp to plan its vaccine disbursement by defining the two epizootic boundaries.
