TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents.
AB  == background & aims: this study is a part of the clinical trials with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 conducted in obese adolescents. previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. the aim of the study was to investigate  the impact of l. salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. methods: the study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized  to intake of l. salivarius ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. the fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative pcr before and after intervention. concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. results: ratios of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group to  firmicutes belonging bacteria, including clostridium cluster xiv, blautia coccoides_eubacteria rectale group and roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p </= 0.05) after administration of ls-33. the cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as clostridium cluster i, clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, the lactobacillus group and bifidobacterium were not significantly  altered by intervention. similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected.  conclusion: l. salivarius ls-33 might modify the fecal microbiota in obese adolescents in a way not related to metabolic syndrome. clinical trial number: nct 01020617.

TI  == insight into the prebiotic concept: lessons from an exploratory, double blind intervention study with inulin-type fructans in obese women.
AB  == objective: to highlight the contribution of the gut microbiota to the modulation  of host metabolism by dietary inulin-type fructans (itf prebiotics) in obese women. methods: a double blind, placebo controlled, intervention study was performed with 30 obese women treated with itf prebiotics (inulin/oligofructose 50/50 mix; n=15) or placebo (maltodextrin; n=15) for 3 months (16 g/day). blood,  faeces and urine sampling, oral glucose tolerance test, homeostasis model assessment and impedancemetry were performed before and after treatment. the gut  microbial composition in faeces was analysed by phylogenetic microarray and qpcr  analysis of 16s rdna. plasma and urine metabolic profiles were analysed by 1h-nmr spectroscopy. results: treatment with itf prebiotics, but not the placebo, led to an increase in bifidobacterium and faecalibacterium prausnitzii; both bacteria negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide levels. itf prebiotics also decreased bacteroides intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus and propionibacterium, an effect associated with a slight decrease in fat mass and with plasma lactate and phosphatidylcholine levels. no clear treatment clustering could be detected for gut microbial analysis or plasma and urine metabolomic profile analyses. however, itf prebiotics led to subtle changes in the gut microbiota that may importantly impact on several key metabolites implicated in obesity and/or diabetes. conclusions: itf prebiotics selectively changed the gut microbiota composition in obese women, leading to modest changes in host metabolism, as suggested by the correlation between some bacterial species and metabolic endotoxaemia or metabolomic signatures.

TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
