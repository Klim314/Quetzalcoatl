TI  == actin enables the antimicrobial action of ll-37 peptide in the presence of microbial proteases.
AB  == host defense peptides play an important host-protective role by their microcidal  action, immunomodulatory functions, and tissue repair activities. proteolysis is  a common strategy of pathogens used to neutralize host defense peptides. here, we show that actin, the most abundant structural protein in eukaryotes, binds the ll-37 host defense peptide, protects it from degradation by the proteases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis, and enables its antimicrobial activity despite the presence of the proteases. co-localization of  ll-37 with extracellular actin was observed in necrotized regions of samples from oral lesions. competition assays, cross-linking experiments, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry revealed that ll-37 binds by specific hydrophobic interactions to the his-40-lys-50 segment of actin, located in the dnase i binding loop. the integrity of the binding site of both ll-37 and actin is a prerequisite to the binding. our results demonstrate that actin, presumably released by dead cells and abundant in infected sites, might be utilized by the immune system to enhance spatio-temporal immunity in an attempt to arrest infection and control inflammation.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis modulates pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced apoptosis of respiratory epithelial cells through the stat3 signaling pathway.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of respiratory and other organ systems in immunocompromised hosts that may invade and proliferate in mucosal epithelial cells to induce apoptosis. previous studies suggest that oral bacteria, especially gram-negative periodontal pathogens, may enhance p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to augment tissue destruction. in this study, we investigated the effect of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis on p. aeruginosa-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. p. gingivalis invasion transiently inhibited p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) signaling pathway. the activated stat3 up-regulated the downstream anti-apoptotic moleculars survivin and b-cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2). this process was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptosis molecular bcl-2-associated death promoter (bad) and caspase-3 activity inhibition. in addition, the activation of the stat3 pathway was affected by p. gingivalis in a dose-dependent manner. finally, co-invasion of p.  aeruginosa and p. gingivalis led to greater cell death compared with p. aeruginosa challenge alone. these results suggest that regulation of p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis by p. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of  respiratory disease. interference with this process may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disease.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == the short-term effects of various oral care methods in dependent elderly: comparison between toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine.
AB  == objectives: to explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. background: numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. however, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various  oral care methods for five consecutive days. materials and methods: the subjects  consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. after the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) tooth brushing 2) tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. results: consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an  improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and  oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). conclusions: it was suggested that the use of not  only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. methods: in a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an er:yag laser or an air-abrasive device. routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (pd) at  the implant. non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. results: pd  reductions (mean +/- sd) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and  air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). no baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. in the air-abrasive group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (p <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (p = 0.002), and fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (p = 0.002). both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (p <0.001). conclusions: at 1 month, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group,  and fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. clinical improvements were limited.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == effects of n-acyl homoserine lactone analogues on porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: the gram-negative anaerobic rod porphyromonas gingivalis in oral biofilms is a primary etiological agent of periodontal disease. biofilm formation of various gram-negative bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing circuit that relies on n-acyl homoserine lactones (hsls). some synthetic n-acyl hsl analogues act as quorum-sensing inhibitors and suppress biofilm formation in pseudomonas aeruginosa. development of chemical control agents against oral biofilms is necessary, because until now, biofilms have been  removed only by mechanical debridement. the present study investigated the effect of n-acyl hsl analogues on p. gingivalis biofilm formation, with the aim of developing new drugs that inhibit oral biofilm formation. material and methods: a flow-cell model was used for p. gingivalis biofilm formation. seventeen synthetic n-acyl hsl analogues were quantitatively assessed by spectrophotometry. the effects of three antagonistic compounds against p. gingivalis biofilm formation were further examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and investigated for primary attachment using spectrophotometry and phase contrast microscopy. results: ten out of 17 analogues affected p. gingivalis biofilm formation. three  out of 10 analogues significantly decreased biofilm-forming cells (p < 0.05), and these biofilm structures were less well formed three-dimensionally. there were no quantitative or qualitative differences in cell attachment between the control and the three analogue-treated groups. conclusion: three synthetic n-acyl hsl analogues inhibited biofilm formation in p. gingivalis. we suggest that these analogues influence the development stage of p. gingivalis biofilm formation.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

AB  == sixteen homologs of multidrug resistance efflux pump operons of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) family were found in the bacteroides fragilis genome sequence by homology searches. disruption mutants were made to the mexb homologs of the four genes most similar to pseudomonas aeruginosa mexb.  reverse transcription-pcr was conducted and indicated that the genes were transcribed in a polycistronic fashion and that the promoter was upstream of bmea (the mexa homolog). one of these disruption mutants (in bmeb, the mexb homolog) was more susceptible than the parental strain to certain cephems, polypeptide antibiotics, fusidic acid, novobiocin, and puromycin. the gene for this homolog and the adjacent upstream gene, bmea, were cloned in a hypersensitive escherichia coli host. the resultant transformants carrying b. fragilis bmeab were more resistant to certain agents; these agents also had lower mics for the b. fragilis bmeb disruption mutants than for the parental strain. the putative efflux pump operon is composed of bmea, bmeb, and bmec (a putative outer membrane channel protein homologous with oprm). addition of the efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a proton conductor that eliminates the energy source) and phe-arg beta-naphthylamide (mc-207,110) (the first specific inhibitor described for rnd pumps in p. aeruginosa), resulted in lowered mics in the parental strain but not in the bmeb disruption mutant, indicating that the bmeb pump is affected by these inhibitors. this is the first description of rnd type pumps in the genus bacteroides.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

AB  == endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located  in confined areas of the root canal system. the antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: kerr pulp canal sealer ewt, grossman's sealer, thermaseal, sealer 26, ah plus, and sealer plus. the agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. in the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. the diameters of the formed discs were recorded. all root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. there were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). all root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. statistical analysis of the results revealed that ah plus and kerr pulp canal sealer ewt had flow values  significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.

TI  == immunopharmacological activities of the nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid a of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the low endotoxic lipid a derived from porphyromonas gingivalis 381, 1-phospho beta(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, induced mitogenic responses in lps low responder c3h/hej as well as lps responder c3h/hen mouse splenocytes. the mitogenic activities of p. gingivalis lipid a in splenocytes of lps responder mice were comparable to that of the synthetic escherichia coli-type lipid a (compound 506). the addition of polymyxin b resulted in the inhibition of mitogenic activity. p. gingivalis lipid a also stimulated strongly nonspecific host resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in balb/c mice, and specific immune response in guinea pigs  against infection with p. gingivalis. furthermore, p. gingivalis lipid a demonstrated antitumour activity against mh134 hepatoma in c3h/hen mice. these life-preserving with tumour regression properties were comparable to those of monophosphoryl lipid a derived from salmonella minnesota re 595. thus, p. gingivalis lipid a appears to have beneficial properties as an immunopharmacological agent.

TI  == capnocytophaga (capnocytophaga ochracea group) bacteremia in hematological patients with profound granulocytopenia.
AB  == the clinical and microbiological features of 7 cases of bacteremia due to capnocytophaga (capnocytophaga ochracea group) are reported. they were diagnosed  during 1991-93 at three hospital clinics. five patients were < 10 years old and all had hematological disorders, 4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1 each had aplastic anemia, non-hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. all were profoundly granulocytopenic with an absolute granulocyte count < 0.13 x 10(9)/l,  and all but 1 had oral lesions as a possible portal of entry. a favourable response to antibiotic therapy was recorded in all patients but one who, being profoundly granulocytopenic, rapidly succumbed to pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia. none of the isolates were beta-lactamase producers. in addition to penicillin the isolates were susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin, but resistant to aminoglycosides.

TI  == bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (bacteroides, gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., eikenella corrodens) and two control species (streptococcus intermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were  selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (pvp-i) aqueous solution in vitro. the pvp-i solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50,  100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. the strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous pvp-i for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.

TI  == microbial aspects of failing osseointegrated dental implants in humans.
AB  == the subgingival microflora of 18 failing implants were examined for pathogenic periodontal microorganisms. peptostreptococcus micros was recovered from 6 failing implants, wolinella recta from 6, fusobacterium species from 5, candida albicans from 5, and bacteroides intermedius from 4. enteric rods or pseudomonads constituted a significant part of the microflora in 5 failing implants. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, nonpigmented bacteroides species, capnocytophage species, and staphylococci were detected in a few implant failures. the present study showed that a complex microflora comprising oral as well as primarily non oral organisms, and bacteria as well as yeasts, can be associated with failing implants. this great diversity in microbial composition and antimicrobial susceptibility among "peri-implantitis" isolates suggest that antimicrobial therapies for implant failures should not be implemented without a  prior comprehensive microbiological analysis.

TI  == the prevalence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in subgingival plaque and their sensitivity to augmentin.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 20 patients with chronic periodontitis who had received no antibiotics for at least 3 months were screened for the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. thirteen of the patients harboured beta-lactamase producing bacteria, most of which were members of the genus bacteroides. the most frequently isolated species were bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides capillosus which are often implicated in acute oral infections. all of the beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides strains were sensitive to a combination of amoxycillin with clavulanic acid (augmentin).

TI  == outbreak of nosocomial flavobacterium meningosepticum respiratory infections associated with use of aerosolized polymyxin b.
AB  == flavobacterium meningosepticum is an uncommon cause of adult nosocomial infection. on a medical/surgical intensive care unit we recently encountered an adult outbreak of respiratory colonization and infection caused by this organism, which was associated with the prophylactic use of aerosolized polymyxin b that had been used in an attempt to abort an outbreak of infection caused by highly resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. twenty isolates (95% from respiratory secretions) of f. meningosepticum from nine persons were identified during a 2 1/2-month period. no environmental source has been identified to date. pneumonia developed in five patients, and two deaths associated with this organism occurred. all isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin; none were sensitive to other antibiotics tested, including third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, antipseudomonal penicillins, aztreonam, and imipenem/cilastatin. two patients with nosocomial pneumonia were successfully treated with oral ciprofloxacin. f. meningosepticum may emerge as an important pathogen if prophylactic use of polymyxin b becomes more widespread. ciprofloxacin may become the agent of choice for treatment of this organism.

TI  == fimbriae of bacteroides nodosus: protein engineering of the structural subunit for the production of an exogenous peptide.
AB  == the pattern of sequence variation between bacteroides nodosus fimbrial subunits of different serotypes suggests a degree of flexibility, which might be exploited for protein engineering approaches for the expression of other peptides. we have  tested this using the well-characterized peptide epitope from vp1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv), residues 144-159: lrgdlqvlaqkvartl (strain 01-bfs). using bacterial codon usage, several oligonucleotides were designed for  the substitution of this sequence internally at hypervariable regions of the fimbrial subunit (aligned for maximum homology), and for its addition at the carboxyterminus with a diglycine spacer as a flexible hinge. following site-directed mutagenesis in phage m13, the modified genes were placed under pl promoter control and placed in a broad host range vector. analysis of the variant proteins expressed in e. coli showed that these substitutions affected, to varying extents, recognition by both anti-fimbrial and anti-fmdv antibodies, indicating that hypervariable region 2 is a major antigenic determinant of the fimbrial subunit and that local stereochemical effects can influence antibody binding to the fmdv peptide antigenic determinant. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, viable transformants could only be obtained with the mutant gene encoding the carboxy-terminal graft. these cells provided fimbrial preparations comprised of the modified subunit. this then constitutes the prototype for the development of  a general expression system for the production of vaccine epitopes and other bioactive peptides. furthermore, there is considerable scope for further modification of the system, for example by engineering specific chemical or protease cleavage sites for release of the grafted peptide. alternatively, the fimbriae themselves may serve as a useful supramolecular carrier or adjuvant for  immune provocation.

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  == aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens  (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). the predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 b  fragilis group and seven b melaninogenicus group), gram-positive anaerobic cocci  (15), fusobacterium sp (six), and clostridium sp (three). the predominant aerobic organisms were escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group a  beta-hemolytic streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus morganii (two of each). five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. incision and drainage were performed on  all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.

TI  == bacteriology of rattlesnake venom and implications for therapy.
AB  == although the incidence of infection secondary to the bites of venomous snakes remains unknown, the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is advocated. in this study, the venom from 15 rattlesnakes was cultured, and 58 aerobic and 28 anaerobic strains of bacteria were isolated. the most common species isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, coagulase-negative staphylocci, and clostridium species. bacteroides fragilis was also recovered. when the fang sheaths of four additional rattlesnakes were retracted and the fangs of these snakes decontaminated, 50% of the samples of venom had no bacterial growth (p = 0.035). until a clinical study is performed, the use of antimicrobial therapy that reflects that complex oral flora of rattlesnakes is still recommended in most cases of envenomization.
