TI  == glucose triggers atp secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  == atp modulates immune cell functions, and atp derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of t helper 17 (th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. we recently reported that enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes atp. we have since found and characterized several atp-secreting bacteria. of the tested enterococci, enterococcus mundtii secreted  the greatest amount of atp (>2 mum/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for atp secretion from e. mundtii. analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial atp secretion. furthermore, exponential-phase e.  mundtii and enterococcus faecalis cells secrete atp more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. other bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, also secrete atp in exponential but  not stationary phase. these results suggest that various gut bacteria, including  commensals and pathogens, might secrete atp at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.

TI  == aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against hela cells. preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines  specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == biofuel cells select for microbial consortia that self-mediate electron transfer.
AB  == microbial fuel cells hold great promise as a sustainable biotechnological solution to future energy needs. current efforts to improve the efficiency of such fuel cells are limited by the lack of knowledge about the microbial ecology  of these systems. the purposes of this study were (i) to elucidate whether a bacterial community, either suspended or attached to an electrode, can evolve in  a microbial fuel cell to bring about higher power output, and (ii) to identify species responsible for the electricity generation. enrichment by repeated transfer of a bacterial consortium harvested from the anode compartment of a biofuel cell in which glucose was used increased the output from an initial level of 0.6 w m(-2) of electrode surface to a maximal level of 4.31 w m(-2) (664 mv, 30.9 ma) when plain graphite electrodes were used. this result was obtained with  an average loading rate of 1 g of glucose liter(-1) day(-1) and corresponded to 81% efficiency for electron transfer from glucose to electricity. cyclic voltammetry indicated that the enhanced microbial consortium had either membrane-bound or excreted redox components that were not initially detected in the community. dominant species of the enhanced culture were identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culturing. the community consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as alcaligenes faecalis and enterococcus gallinarum, which are capable of hydrogen production. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were also isolated. for several isolates, electrochemical activity was mainly due to excreted redox mediators, and one of these mediators, pyocyanin produced by p. aeruginosa, could be characterized. overall, the enrichment procedure, irrespective of whether only attached or suspended bacteria were examined, selected for organisms capable of mediating the electron transfer either by direct bacterial transfer or by excretion of redox components.

TI  == [evaluation of "helicobacter-selective-medium (nissui seiyaku)" for rapid detection of helicobacter pylori].
AB  == we evaluated helicobacter selective agar (hsa) medium (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo, japan), which has been newly developed and has been commercially available since june in 1998. hsa medium strongly inhibited the growth of possible contaminants from gastric biopsy-specimens, such as alpha-streptococci, neisseria species, enterococcus gallinarum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, corynebacterium species, capnocytophaga species, and candida albicans. cultures run in parallel with helicobacter pylori agar (hpa) medium (eiken chemical co., ltd., tokyo, japan) disclosed no discordance in the detective rates of h. pylori strains between the media examined. inaddition, the  numbers of the colonies and the colony-sizes grown on the plates were also in good agreement with each other. however, it would be strikingly favorable that the appearing colonies on the hsa medium turned purple. this coloration enabled us to detect the emergence of the colonies much earlier and easier when compared  with the conventional other media including hpa medium (eiken). these findings led us to conclude that hsa medium (nissui) was superior to hpa medium (eiken) in the prompt detection and the rapid identification of h. pylori in routine clinical microbiology.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (o-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. for stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and atcc 19433), enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (atcc 25778), and enterococcus gallinarum (atcc 35038) produced extracellular o-2. among 106 strains comprising 13 species  of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular o-2. mean (+/-se) rates of extracellular o-2 production in vitro by e . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of o-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (p=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular o-2 production.
