TI  - Effect of a novel quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (QAMP) on adhesion and antibacterial properties of dental adhesives.
AB  - This study investigated the resin-dentin bond strength (muTBS), degree of conversion (DC), and antibacterial potential of an innovative adhesive system containing a quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (QAMP) using in situ and in vitro assays. Forty-two human third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and were randomly distributed into three groups of self-etching adhesive systems: Clearfil SE Bond containing 5% QAMP (experimental group), Clearfil Protect Bond (positive control) and Clearfil SE Bond (negative control). After light curing, three 1 mm-increments of composite resin were bonded to each dentin surface. A total of thirty of these bonded teeth (10 teeth per group) was sectioned to obtain stick-shaped specimens and tested under tensile stress immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of storage in distilled water. Twelve bonded teeth (4 teeth per group) were longitudinally sectioned in a mesio-to-distal direction to obtain resin-bonded dentin slabs. In situ DC was evaluated by micro-Raman spectroscopy. In vitro DC of thin films of each adhesive system was measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In vitro susceptibility tests of these three adhesive systems were performed by the minimum inhibitory/minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) assays against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces naeslundii. No statistically significant difference in muTBS was observed between Clearfil SE Bond containing 5% QAMP and Clearfil SE Bond (p>0.05) immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of water storage. However Clearfil Protect Bond showed a significant reduction of muTBS after 12 months of storage (p=0.039). In addition, QAMP provided no significant change in DC after incorporating into Clearfil SE Bond (p>0.05). Clearfil SE Bond containing 5% QAMP demonstrated MIC/MBC values similar to the positive control against L. casei and A. naeslundii and higher than the negative control for all evaluated bacterial strains. The use of QAMP in an adhesive system demonstrated effective bond strength, a suitable degree of conversion, and adequate antibacterial effects against oral bacteria, and may be useful as a new approach to provide long-lasting results for dental adhesives.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Screening and Scoring of Antimicrobial and Biological Activities of Italian Vulnerary Plants against Major Oral Pathogenic Bacteria.
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the activity of Italian vulnerary plants against the  most important oral pathogenic bacteria. This estimate was accomplished through a fivefold process: (a) a review of ethnobotanical and microbiological data concerning the Italian vulnerary plants; (b) the development of a scoring system to rank the plants; (c) the comparative assessment of microbiological properties; (d) the assessment of potential cytotoxic effects on keratinocyte-like cells and gingival fibroblasts in culture by XTT cell viability assay; (e) clinical evaluation of the most suitable plant extract as antibacterial agent in a home-made mouthwash. The study assays hexane (H), ethanol (E), and water (W) extracts from 72 plants. The agar diffusion method was used to evaluate the activity against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces viscosus. Twenty-two plants showed appreciable activity. The extracts showing the strongest antibacterial power were those from Cotinus coggygria Scop., Equisetum hyemale L., Helichrysum litoreum Guss, Juniperus communis L., and Phyllitis scolopendrium (L.) Newman subsp. scolopendrium. The potential cytotoxic effect of these extracts was assessed. On the basis of these observations, a mouth-rinse containing the ethanolic extract of H. litoreum has been tested in vivo, resulting in reduction of the salivary concentration of S. mutans.
TI  - High strength re-mineralizing, antibacterial dental composites with reactive calcium phosphates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Development of high strength dental composites with adhesive, antibacterial and re-mineralizing potential. MATERIALS: Urethane and triethylene glycol dimethacrylates were combined with HEMA (10 or 20wt%) and 2MP (2 or 10wt%), antibacterial chlorhexidine (2.5wt%) and chemical cure initiators. Reactive mono/tri calcium phosphate (CP) mixed with silica/silicon carbide nanoparticles (S) (CP:S weight ratio 1:2 or 2:1) was added (50wt%). RESULTS: Decreasing CP/S ratio and HEMA content reduced monomer conversion at 15min from 93 to 63%. Conversely, decreasing CP/S increased initial "dry" compressive (137-203MPa) and flexural (79-116MPa) strength. With high HEMA content, these decreased by approximately 15-20MPa upon 24h water storage. With low HEMA content, average decline was <8MPa due to reduced water sorption. Early water sorption induced mass increase, volume expansion, mono calcium phosphate dissolution and chlorhexidine release, were proportional to the initial calcium phosphate content. Furthermore, they increased approximately 1.5 fold upon raising HEMA wt%. These diffusion controlled processes and strength decline slowed after 24h as phosphates reaction bound water within the materials. Increasing 2MP concentration reduced calcium release but did not affect strength. Formulations with high CP/S indicated greater antibacterial activity in agar diffusion and in vitro biofilm tests. SIGNIFICANCE: New material use beneath a conventional composite could potentially reduce high failure rates associated with residual caries and bacterial microleakage.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological evaluation of the carious dentin before and after application of Papacarie gel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinically and microbiologically the efficacy of Papacarie in the removal of carious dentin in both permanent and primary teeth. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty permanent and primary molars with dentinal carious lesions were excavated and subjected to clinical and microbiological assessment before and after application of Papacarie. The gel was further tested for in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against standard cariogenic micro-organisms using agar diffusion assay. RESULTS: Papacarie was able to differentiate between infected and affected dentin clinically along with high patient comfort during caries excavation. The mean time taken for caries removal and restoration was observed to be 4.17 +/- 0.40 min. and 8.57 +/- 0.45 min. for permanent teeth and 4.21 +/- 0.36 min. and 9.24 +/- 0.58 min. for primary teeth. There was a significant reduction in the total viable colony forming units from the dentin samples before and after application of Papacarie. It was also observed that Papacarie had no inhibitory effect on standard cariogenic microorganisms in the agar diffusion assay. CONCLUSIONS: Papacarie is an effective caries removal method clinically in both permanent and primary teeth. The number of viable microorganisms after complete caries excavation using Papacarie still appears to be high and this bacterial count should be tackled by a suitable restorative material with potent antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of three new and two established root canal irrigation solutions.
AB  - This study sought to assess the efficacy of two established and three relatively  new root canal irrigants against five different microorganisms using the agar diffusion method. Sodium hypochloride (NaOCl)-based irrigants demonstrated the most effective antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Incorporation of antimicrobial agents can be used to enhance the antibacterial effect of endodontic sealers.
AB  - AIM: The antibacterial activity of five endodontic sealers against three different microorganism strains alone and following incorporation of 2% benzalkonium chloride (BC) and 2% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) was evaluated. METHODOLOGY: The agar diffusion method was used to determine the inhibitory effect of the following endodontic sealers: RoekoSeal, Endomethasone N, N2, Apexit Plus and AH plus, on Streptococcus mutans - ATCC 25175, Lactobacillus casei - ATCC 4646 and Actinomyces viscosus - ATCC 19246. Bacterial strains were inoculated into BHIB, and incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere (37 degrees C). From the bacteria grown in the liquid medium, the density of the inoculum was set to be equivalent to McFarland 2 standard. In Shaedler agar, 350 muL of the bacterial suspension were equally spread. Specimens (4 mm x 6 mm) were prepared from each material without and with addition of 2% BC or 2% CPC. The inhibition zones were determined after 2 days, after 7 days and after 21 days of incubation. RESULTS: The largest inhibition zones were shown at zero time in all cases, with progressively less inhibition at 7 and 21 days. Endomethasone N and N2 showed the most intense antimicrobial activity, while RoekoSeal showed the least antimicrobial effect. The most susceptible microorganism was A. viscosus. Greater antimicrobial effects were found following incorporation of BC or CPC, and generally, BC gave greater inhibition zones than CPC. CONCLUSIONS: Adding either BC or CPC has the potential to improve clinical outcomes with endodontic sealers, as these substances enhance the short-term antimicrobial effects of the sealers.
TI  - Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  - High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.
TI  - Effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. We report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding RNAs is stimulated. In the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. However, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. We also observed a significant upregulation of ABC transport systems and putative transposases. Changes in Clusters of Orthologous Groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of transcription factors were upregulated. Finally, we identified several small noncoding RNAs whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. These results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.
TI  - Antibacterial and phytochemical studies on Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. latex  against selected cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial potential of the chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol and aqueous extracts of Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. was evaluated by using five cariogenic bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The chloroform extracted fraction of latex showed inhibitory effect against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC value of 0.032 and 0.52 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative investigation on structure elucidation of bioactive compound using IR, NMR and GC-MS techniques revealed the presence of methyl nonanoate, a saturated fatty acid.
TI  - Molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 DNA probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDDH) technique. METHODS: Eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. Each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. After 30 days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by CDDH. Data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). Forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +Treponema socranskii," and the cluster of Actinomyces) were assessed. RESULTS: Most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for Streptococcus constellatus, Campylobacter rectus, Tannerella forsythia, T socranskii, and Lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), Propionibacterium acnes I and Eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and Treponema denticola (77.8%). Among the cariogenic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than L acidophillus and Lactobacillus casei (P <0.001). The periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +T socranskii" (P <0.0001). Among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, Veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (P <0.0001). The numbers of yellow and green complex bacteria and the cluster of Actinomyces were similar (P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.
TI  - Community-based interference against integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  - As part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. Unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Less emphasis has been given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. When co-cultivated in saliva medium, P. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. Furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. More interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent P. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. Our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion on cariogenic planktonic and biofilm organisms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nanoemulsions (NE) are a unique class of disinfectants produced by  mixing a water immiscible liquid phase into an aqueous phase under high shear forces. NE have antimicrobial properties and are also effective anti-biofilm agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of nanoemulsion and its components was determined against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei by live/dead staining. In vitro antimicrobial effectiveness of nanoemulsion against planktonic S. mutans, L. casei, Actinomyces viscosus, Candida albicans and mixed culture was determined by a serial dilution technique to obtain minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC). In addition, efficacy was investigated by kinetics of killing, adherence and biofilm assays. RESULTS: Compared to its components, nanoemulsion showed notable antimicrobial activity against biofilm organisms, up to 83.0% kill within 1min. NE dilutions ranging from 243 to 19683 were effective against planktonic S. mutans, L. casei, A. viscosus, C. albicans and mixed culture of these four strains as shown through MIC/MBC assays. NE showed antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells at high dilutions, confirmed by time kill studies. The level of adhesion on glass surface was reduced by 94.2-99.5% in nanoemulsion treated groups (p<0.001). 4-Day-old S. mutans, L. casei, A. viscosus, C. albicans and mixed cultures biofilms treated with NE showed reductions of bacterial counts with decreasing dilutions (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that nanoemulsion has effective anti-cariogenic activity against cariogenic microorganisms and may be a useful medication in the prevention of caries.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. METHODS: Comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. The following microorganisms were investigated: Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei and Candida albicans. For cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (CFUs), Columbia blood agar plates or Sabouraud agar were used. The cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. Colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. The rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. All experiments were done twice and the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: There was no significant reduction in CFUs by silver-coated toothbrushes (P > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. On the contrary, the colony counts for S. sanguis (P = 0.02) and C. albicans (P = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. Silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a triclosan-containing resin composite matrix against three common oral bacteria.
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial effect of a resin composite matrix with or without incorporated triclosan (0.3 wt%) on Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Lactobacillus casei. In the quantitative assay, bacterial suspensions were filled into 20-mul cavities within temporary restorative resins. After 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h of incubation, the suspensions were removed from the restoratives and the numbers of viable bacteria were determined. Bacterial suspensions incubated without restoratives served as the controls. Ten replicates were carried out for each experiment. The resin composite containing triclosan demonstrated variable degrees of antibacterial activity against the microorganisms, revealing a significant inhibitory effect on S. mutans within 12 h compared to the control. The viable counts of A. viscosus significantly decreased after 24 h. A significant reduction of L. casei was observed after 48 h. The unloaded resin composite did not reveal a marked antibacterial effect. The resin composite loaded with triclosan might be beneficial in preventing cavity contamination and minimizing the risk of pulpal irritation in the short-term.
TI  - Does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? Strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. The leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) was evaluated together with its uptake by superficial dental enamel. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). Strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following Fuji Ortho LC application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. RESULTS: Strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. At the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. Under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS: RMGIC releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. No significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. However synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species with and without the presence of saliva and a possible effect on the salivary proteins. METHODS: Suspensions of Actinomyces naeslundii (ACTCC 12104(T)), Lactobacilli casei (N CTC 151) and Streptococcus mutans (NCTC 10449), in salt buffer or in saliva, were exposed to ozone gas delivered by the ozone generator Healozone 2130C. Aliquots of the suspensions were taken after 10, 30 and 60s ozone exposures and cultivated on agar plates. Initial number of bacteria per ml was 8.0 x 10(7) (SD 2.2 x 10(7)) (A. naeslundii), 1.0 x 10(8) (SD 3.1 x 10(6)) (L. casei) and 1.0 x 10(8) (SD 7.0 x 10(5)) (S. mutans), respectively. The proteins were separated by SDS electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. RESULTS: In salt buffer 92%, 73% and 64% of the initial numbers of A. naeslundii, S. mutans and L. casei, respectively, were killed already after 10s ozone exposure, while approximately 99.9% of the bacteria were dead after a 60s exposure. After 10 and 30s, but not after 60s exposure to ozone, S. mutans and L. casei were less efficiently killed in saliva compared to the salt buffer. Various saliva proteins were degraded by ozone after a 60s exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The cariogenic species S. mutans, L. casei and A. naeslundii were almost eliminated following 60s of ozone treatment. This killing was reduced in the presence of saliva although increasing the ozone application time to 60s overcame these reductants in saliva. Detection of altered salivary proteins indicates that saliva components constitute additional targets for ozone.
TI  - Microarray analysis of the microflora of root caries in elderly.
AB  - The present study used a new 16S rRNA-based microarray with probes for over 300 bacterial species to better define the bacterial profiles of healthy root surfaces and root caries (RC) in the elderly. Supragingival plaque was collected from 20 healthy subjects (Controls) and from healthy and carious roots and carious dentin from 21 RC subjects (Patients). Collectively, 179 bacterial species and species groups were detected. A higher bacterial diversity was observed in Controls than in Patients. Lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus were notably associated with most RC samples. Streptococcus mutans was detected more frequently in the infected dentin than in the other samples, but the difference was not significant. Actinomyces was found more frequently in Controls. Thus, species other than Actinomyces and S. mutans may play a role as pathogens of RC. The results from this study were in general agreement with those of our previous study based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) monomers on bacteria associated with oral infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt monomers in order to evaluate their potential applications as dental materials. In vitro susceptibility testing of the monomers was performed by the broth dilution method on bacteria associated with oral infections: Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 15987, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393. The time-kill kinetics of the monomer with relatively higher antibacterial activity against S. mutans were also investigated. It was found that all the tested bacteria strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which methacryloxylethyl cetyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-CB) exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations, ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 microg/ml. The time-kill curve showed that DMAE-CB achieved 99.44% killing at 19.2 microg/ml (4 times the minimal bactericidal concentration) against S. mutans after 1 min and 100% killing within 10 min of contact. This result indicates that the quaternary ammonium salt monomer DMAE-CB may be a candidate antibacterial agent for incorporation into dental restorative materials.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 as a pulp capping agent in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 composites (nHA-PA66) as a pulp capping agent. METHODS: The micro-organisims used in this study included Streptococcous mutans (S. mutans), Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) and Actinomyces viscosus (A. viscosus), three standard bacterial strains predominant in deep carious lesions. Agar diffusion test was used to determine the diameter of bacterial inhibition zones of nHA-PA66 compared with hydroxyapatite paste, calcium hydroxide paste and nHA-PA66 mixed with iodoform paste. RESULTS: It showed that the polymerized films and fresh paste of nHA-PA66 had no antimicrobial activity to S. mutans and very little to L. casei and A. viscosus. The antimicrobial activity of nHA-PA66 mixed with iodoform paste obviously increased, but no significant difference compared with calcium hydroxide paste. There, was no antimicrobial activity of hydroxyapatite paste to the three test bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest nHA-PA66 used as pulp capping agent alone almost has no antimicrobial effect to the three test bacteria, but the antimicrobial activity can be increased by combining with iodoform.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - Potentiation of the bactericidal activity of Harungana madagascariensis Lam. ex Poir. (Hypericaceae) leaf extract against oral bacteria using poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles: in vitro study.
AB  - Harungana madagascariensis Lam. ex Poir. (Hypericaceae) is known to have biological properties with mainly antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the ethyl acetate H. madagascariensis leaf extract (HLE) on the main oral bacterial strains largely implicated in dental caries and gingivitis infections, and the possibility of potentialization of HLE antibacterial effects using the poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLG-NP). The microdilution technique and the interfacial polymer deposition following the solvent diffusion method were used to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of ethyl acetate HLE and to prepare nanoparticles, respectively. HLE showed significant bactericidal effects against the bacterial strains tested, with minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) to 5 x 10(2) mg/l or less, except for Lactobacillus casei with 7.5 x 10(2) mg/l. With the HLE incorporated into PLG nanoparticles (HLE-PLG-NP), we observed diminution of the bactericidal concentration compared to HLE, the upper MBC being of 1.875 x 10(2) mg/l. Incorporation of the HLE into a colloidal carrier optimized its antibacterial performance.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans (Ingbritt), Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 393), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Candida albicans (ATCC 90028). The results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (F=38.290; P<0.01). The six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. Among them, Longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by ZnO whisker antibacterial complex (ZnOw) AT-83, IONPURE-H, basic magnesium hypochlorite, ZnOw AT-88 and Antim-AMS2. The broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.
TI  - Effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Aqueous extracts of miswak (Salvadora persica; Arak tree) and derum (Juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of Balb/C 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. RESULTS: The data revealed that Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, extracts from both miswak and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. The most sensitive organisms were A. viscosus, followed by S. mutans, S. salivarius, with L. casei being the most resistant. CONCLUSION: The results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - Antibacterial effects and physical properties of glass-ionomer cements containing chlorhexidine for the ART approach.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) involves removal of carious lesions with manual instruments, improvement of filling materials to guarantee greater success should be considered. This study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, physical, and bonding properties of glass-ionomer cements (GIC) containing chlorhexidine (CHX), and to determine optimal concentrations for incorporation of agents to obtain antibacterial GICs for use with the ART approach. METHODS: CHX diacetate combined with CHX dihydrochloride was added to control GIC powder to obtain concentration ratios of 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 1/1, or 2/2% w/w. Antibacterial activity of each cement against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei or Actinomyces naeslundii was examined using agar-diffusion methods, and release of CHX was analyzed by HPLC. Compressive strength, bond strength to dentin, and setting time were measured, and compared with those of control samples. RESULTS: All experimental GICs exhibited inhibition of three bacteria, but sizes of inhibition zones and concentrations of CHX released were not dependent upon CHX content. Incorporation of CHX diacetate at 2% or greater, significantly decreased compressive strength, and bond strength to dentin was adversely affected by addition of CHX diacetate at 2% or more (p<0.05, ANOVA, Fisher's PLSD test), although setting time was extended a little by addition of any concentrations of CHX. SIGNIFICANCE: The present results demonstrate that experimental GICs containing CHX are effective in inhibiting bacteria associated with caries, and incorporation of 1% CHX diacetate is optimal to give appropriate physical and bonding properties.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of Clearfil Protect Bond.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of a commercially available self-etching adhesive system, Clearfil Protect Bond, which contains antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB). METHODS: Inhibitory effects against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, or Actinomyces naeslundii were examined by an agar-disc diffusion method using the Clearfil Protect Bond primer containing 5% MDPB and an acidic adhesion-promoting monomer MDP, the primer only with MDP, and the primer with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. The minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) of each primer for the three bacterial species were determined by serial microdilution assays. For testing the bactericidal effects seen in dentin, the primer was applied to demineralized dentin blocks in which S. mutans had been impregnated, and numbers of viable bacteria were counted. RESULTS: For all three bacteria, the sizes of the inhibition zones produced by Clearfil Protect Bond primer were significantly greater than for the other primers (p<0.05, ANOVA and Scheffe's F-test). The MIC/MBC values of Clearfil Protect Bond primer were less than those of the primer without MDPB, and comparable to those of the primer containing cetylpyridinium chloride. No bacterial recovery was obtained after application of Clearfil Protect Bond primer to the bacteria-impregnated dentin, although the primer without MDPB showed some bactericidal effect. SIGNIFICANCE: Clearfil Protect Bond primer has strong antibacterial activity based upon MDPB against S. mutans, L. casei and A. naeslundii, and the capability to disinfect cavities containing residual bacteria.
TI  - Salivary Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. The study population consisted of 297 predominantly African- American women who were pregnant for the first time. The salivary bacterial levels evaluated were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. RESULTS: For 1 unit increase in log(10) A. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; SE = 29.1; P = 0.04), and a 0.17 week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; SE = 0.09; P = 0.05). In contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) L. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; SE = 19.3; P = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; SE = 0.06; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. These organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.
TI  - In situ and non-invasive detection of specific bacterial species in oral biofilms using fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Noninvasive in situ detection of suspected cariogenic bacterial species within dental biofilms could facilitate monitoring of the dynamic change of oral microbial flora and assist in the assessment of the treatment efficacy of therapeutic agents. In this study, we explore the possibility to use three well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Lactobacillus casei to identify these three important members of the oral microbial community in the complex environment of oral biofilms. These MAbs, which were conjugated to different fluorescent labels and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), proved to be an useful tool to identify the three species of interest (S. mutans, A. naeslundii, and L. casei) under various experimental conditions including in vitro and in vivo derived oral biofilms. Manifold addition of the MAbs on consecutive days did not alter the biofilm structure thus allowing monitoring of the same biofilm over extended time periods. Using this MAb-based method the effect of sucrose challenge on the biofilm composition and the distribution of S. mutans, A. naeslundii, and L. casei were examined. S. mutans was found to be the predominant species under the various biofilm conditions tested. These studies indicate that MAbs based bacterial detection with CLSM is a versatile tool which permits new insights into the ecology of oral biofilm development.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of a dentin conditioner combined with antibacterial agents.
AB  - Dental hand instruments are not efficient in removing all infected dentin when performing carious removal for minimal intervention techniques. The use of an antibacterial dentin conditioner may therefore be useful when restoring cavities that have residual carious dentin. Antibacterial agents--chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, benzaIkonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite, were added either to a dentin conditioner used for glass ionomer cements or distilled water at 1% concentration. Dentin conditioning solutions at pH 2.5, 4.9 and 7.7 were also prepared, along with 1% aqueous thymol. Using an agar diffusion test, 25 microl aliquots were examined for their inhibitory effects on three cariogenic bacteria. After 24 hours, an agar pellet was extracted adjacent to the agar well and placed on a second inoculated agar plate to observe sustained inhibitory effects, after which this procedure was repeated one more time. Antibacterial dentin conditioners showed significant inhibitory effect compared to the control over the three test periods (p<0.016). The combination of dentin conditioners with antibacterial agents significantly reduced the inhibitory effect compared to the antibacterial aqueous solutions (p<0.016). One-percent aqueous thymol showed no inhibitory effect against the test bacteria. The cetrimide-dentin conditioner showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all three test bacteria over the three experimental periods (p<0.016). The inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents was significantly reduced when combined with a dentin conditioner. Only the cetrimide-dentin conditioner combination produced significant inhibitory effects against all three test organisms.
TI  - Effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  - According to the US Surgeon General's report, "Oral Health in America," published in 2000, most adults in the United States show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. Periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. New evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. For this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. This article summarizes laboratory research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. This unique combination of agents is found in Colgate Total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. Data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. In addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone resorption. Overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of Colgate Total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.
TI  - [Development and use of periodontal dressing of collagen and Lactobacillus casei  37 cell suspension in combined treatment of periodontal disease of inflammatory origin (a microbiological study)].
AB  - Periodontal dressing consisting of collagen and Lactobacillus casei 37 cell suspension (cell concentration 108 cells/ml) was created and used in combined treatment of patients with chronic generalized parodontitis. Efficacy of the developed isolation was explained by a considerable decrease of the number and frequency of isolation of aggressive microbial representatives (pigment synthesizing Bacteroids, Actinomyces and Str. intermedius) in periodontal pockets and also Fungus (Candida albicans). This periodontal dressing provided remission up to 10-12 months.
TI  - In vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (TD-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and Corynebacterium spp.
AB  - Telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. We determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 Corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards procedures. Plates with daptomycin were supplemented with Ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. The MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: Actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium ramosum (n = 16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and Corynebacterium spp. (n = 31), 0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of TD-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except C. clostridioforme and Lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more active. Daptomycin had decreased activity (MIC > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains of Actinomyces spp. and all C. ramosum, Eubacterium lentum, and Lactobacillus plantarum strains. Linezolid showed decreased activity (MIC > 4 microg/ml) against C. ramosum, two strains of C. difficile, and 15 strains of Lactobacillus spp. Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. The MICs of ampicillin for eight Clostridium spp. and three strains of L. casei were >1 microg/ml. The MIC(90) of TD-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. TD-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.
TI  - Comparison of type 1 and type 2 cytokine production by mononuclear cells cultured with streptococcus mutans and selected other caries bacteria.
AB  - A feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mRNA  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. These results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (Lactobacillus casei, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Prevotella intermedia). All isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. S. mutans was the most potent and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. Differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with L. casei the dominant producer. S. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. P. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. A similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by L. casei, A. viscosus, and P. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. A better understanding of pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of simplified adhesive systems.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine and compare the intrinsic antibacterial activity of commercially available simplified adhesive systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of five self-etching/priming one-step adhesives and three priming/bonding adhesives against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces viscosus was assessed by the agar disc-diffusion test and determination of the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC). Twenty microl of each adhesive was impregnated into a paper disc and placed on an agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension, with or without light-irradiation. The size of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of incubation. The MIC values were measured by serial microdilution assays, visually examining the growth of bacteria after incubation with each adhesive for 24-48 hours. The subcultures were made on BHI agar plates from the wells showing no visible growth of bacteria, and the MBC values were determined based on production of colonies. Two primers in two-step self-etching systems and an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine were tested for reference. The results of disc-diffusion tests were analyzed by ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test. RESULTS: The size of inhibition zones produced by adhesives varied among the brands. None of the available commercial adhesives showed significant inhibition against all three of the bacterial species tested. Light-irradiation reduced the size of inhibition zones for a few materials, but a similar trend to the effectiveness of non-irradiated specimens was observed. The antibacterial activity of commercial products determined in terms of MIC/MBC values were different from the results by disc-diffusion tests. The self-etching adhesives with low pH were not necessarily more effective than priming/bonding solutions, and no significant relationships between the acidity and antibacterial effects were found. Compared with commercial products, an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine produced significantly larger inhibition zones against all species (P < 0.05) and exhibited greater bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity, demonstrating lower MIC/MBC values.
TI  - Inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  - The objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (GIC). This was assessed using an agar diffusion test. Chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to Fuji IX GIC at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. Antibacterial-GIC specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (Streptococcis, Lactobacillus, and Actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. The experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. Control specimens of the GIC produced no bacterial inhibition. The antibacterial-GIC combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. Resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on week 1. CT-GIC showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. The addition of antibacterial agents to Fuji IX creates a GIC material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.
TI  - Production and characterization of species-specific monoclonal antibodies against Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Dental caries is a disease induced by a few cariogenic bacterial species. Quantitative detection of these cariogenic bacteria could provide useful information for caries risk assessment. In this study, we developed highly species-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the type strains of Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 11578. Assayed with immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent microscopy, these antibodies showed high sensitivities and specificities in detecting A. naeslundii and L. casei in saliva. Examining 100 saliva samples using these MAb-based techniques, we found that the number of A. naeslundii in saliva ranges from 0.5 x 10(4) to 4.8 x 10(5) and that the number of L. casei in saliva ranges from 1 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6). With fluorescent imaging techniques and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), these antibodies were used to visualize A. naeslundii and L. casei within dental plaques derived from stimulated whole human saliva in vitro. The study demonstrated that these MAbs were also able to effectively detect A. naeslundii and L. casei in plaque.
TI  - Effects of nitrite and nitrate on the growth and acidogenicity of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - It is hypothesised that exogenous nitrite acidified by metabolic products of acidogenic bacteria in the mouth will be converted to products which inhibit growth of the bacteria in question which contribute to dental caries. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (1) to test the activity of both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite at differing concentrations on the ability of Streptococcus mutans to lower the pH of its surroundings and hence (2) to determine whether either nitrate or nitrite might be bactericidal or bacteriostatic against S. mutans. METHODS: S. mutans NCTC 10449(T) was cultured in a liquid medium to which either sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to a final concentration of 0.0, 0.2, 2.0, 20 or 200 mM, of which the first acted as a test substance negative control. After 24 h, the cultures were streaked onto agar to test for growth and the remaining culture used for pH measurement. The Mann-Whitney U-Test was used for statistical comparison of pH values. RESULTS: Nitrite at concentrations of 20 and 200 mM had a highly significant inhibitory effect (p < 0.001) on the ability of S. mutans NCTC 10449(T) to lower pH. Moreover, bacteria that had been subjected to these levels of nitrite were unable to recover on solid medium. Nitrate had no such effect on either the growth of the bacteria or on their ability to lower pH. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that nitrite, at final concentrations of either 20 or 200 mM, is both bactericidal and anti-acidogenic with respect to S. mutans, while lower concentrations of nitrite and all concentrations of nitrate are ineffective. Nitrite might be worthy of consideration as a mouth-rinse constituent.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of ZnCl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  - Although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of Zn on different organisms under both fixed pH and free-fall conditions. Here, the effect of ZnCl(2) on Streptococcus salivarius, Strep. mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. pH-stat experiments were performed at pH 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; pH-fall experiments started at pH 7. In both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for Zn and lactate determinations. Under pH-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by Zn most strongly in Strep. sobrinus and Strep. salivarius. In terms of total acid production averted, however, the effect of Zn under both pH-stat and pH-fall conditions was clearly greatest with Strep. salivarius. A. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under pH-stat conditions. Cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mM initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mM). Packed cell layers responded to Zn quite differently from suspensions, the pH often falling in the presence of 1mM Zn at a rate similar to the no Zn control. As streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both pH-stat and pH-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as A. naeslundii.
TI  - The predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  - The predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (pH 5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. Streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. The proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. Actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque samples. The proportions of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus spp. and Veillonella spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. The most frequently isolated lactobacilli were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The predominant aciduric flora was S. oralis, S. mutans and A. israelii and these taxa were also isolated from a similar proportion of the lesions at pH 7.0. Strains of S. mutans, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were genotyped using PCR-based methods. Each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. These data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Effects of three different infant dentifrices on biofilms and oral microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: A--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; B--with 1100 ppm of NaF and sodium lauryl sulfate; C--with extract of calendula. The dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using reference strains A. viscosus (ATCC 43146); C. albicans (ATCC 51501); L. casei (ATCC 4646); S. mitis (ATCC 49456); S. mutans (ATCC 25175); S. oralis (ATCC 35037); S. sanguis (ATCC 10586); S. sobrinus (ATCC 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms C. albicans, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus and Lactobacillus sp. Twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the Infants Clinic of the Pediatric Dentistry Department, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. Supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. The results were statistically analyzed by the ANOVA and Tukey Test. After the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice B concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (CFU/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, exposure to the dentifrices A and C concentrated and dentifrice B 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. The dentifrices A and C, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice B in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect on any microorganism evaluated. For all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice B concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).
TI  - Changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  - This study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. The final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. Dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a Ca(OH)(2) compound and temporary sealing. Reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. Microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. After anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. Before temporary restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. Gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. Before the final excavation, which did not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. Gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by A. naeslundii and various streptococci. In conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.
TI  - Fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. METHODS: The antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and summation operator FIC index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The summation operator FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. RESULTS: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using summation operator FIC values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. CONCLUSIONS: According to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.
TI  - The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  - A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (NO) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. The aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through NO production, on Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces naeslundii. Whereas the growth of S. mutans was inhibited by a more acid pH, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after 24 h of exposure. Similar effects were observed with A. naeslundii and L. casei. The ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also markedly affected by nitrite concentration. At acidity levels below pH 7, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mM) caused effective complete killing of S. mutans, with similar effects on the other organisms tested. These results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva has an effect on the growth and survival of cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Distribution of three cariogenic bacteria in secondary carious lesions around amalgam restorations.
AB  - Secondary dental caries remains an unresolved problem in dentistry and little is  known of its microbial etiology. The purpose of this study was to compare the distribution of the three most suspected cariogenic groups of bacteria, mutans streptococci. Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacilli, in natural secondary caries around amalgam restorations. Extracted teeth with secondary caries were sectioned to obtain three samples that were randomly distributed to three different groups. Each group was immunolabeled with antibodies to either Streptococcus mutans, A. naeslundii genospecies 2 or Lactobacillus casei and subsequently labeled with secondary fluorescent antibodies. All samples were analyzed three-dimensionally using confocal microscopy. The results indicated that the three different bacteria were widely present and could have an important role in the development of secondary caries around amalgam restorations.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  - Most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. Two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon Tn916 mutagenesis of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis). A 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dltA and dltB of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (formerly called Lactobacillus casei). A 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous DNA in a fosmid library of S. gordonii DL1. This DNA encoded D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in Escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. The cloned streptococcal dltA was disrupted by inserting an ermAM cassette, and then it was linearized and transformed into S. gordonii DL1 for allelic replacement. Erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dltA exhibited a loss of D-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. This phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kDa surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (C. J. Whittaker, D. L. Clemans, and P. E. Kolenbrander, Infect. Immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). The mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric coaggregations. The mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. The natural DNA transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. Southern analysis of chromosomal DNAs from various streptococcal species with the dltA probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. Thus, it is hypothesized that D-alanyl LTA may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kDa adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of proprietary self-etching primers.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine and compare the in vitro antibacterial activity of three self-etching primers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LB primer (Liner Bond 2), FB primer (Fluoro Bond), and MB conditioner (Tokuso Mac Bond) were evaluated. The antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces viscosus was assessed using the agar disc-diffusion method. Twenty microliters of each primer were impregnated into a paper disc and placed on a Brain Heart Infusion agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension. The size of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of incubation of the plate. In addition, 20 microliters of each primer was added to a 1 ml suspension of S. mutans adjusted to 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(5), or 1 x 10(4) CFU/ml in phosphate buffered saline and kept in contact for 30 seconds. The number of viable bacteria after contact with each primer was determined. The results were analyzed by ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test (P < 0.05). RESULTS: LB primer and FB primer produced inhibition zones against S. mutans and A. viscosus, and MB conditioner produced an inhibition zone only against A. viscosus. No inhibition zones were produced by any of the primers against L. casei. The three primers completely killed 1 x 10(4) CFU of S. mutans within 30 seconds of contact. When 1 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(6) CFU of bacterial cells were kept in contact, significant differences in the number of recovered viable cells were found among the three primers with MB conditioner being the most bactericidal. LB primer had little bactericidal activity and the mean reduction of viable bacteria by FB primer and MB conditioner was approximately 30% and 65%, respectively.
TI  - Acid-regulated proteins induced by Streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  - Our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal pH values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low pH (pH 3.0-4.0) that kills unadapted control cells maintained at pH 7.5 (Oral Microbiol Immunol 1997: 12: 266-273). In this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low pH. For this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from pH 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14C]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. The cells were extracted for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. Of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in pH homeostasis. Streptococcus mutans LT11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. The enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kDa. Within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane H+/ATPase. By comparison, the strong responder, Lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. Streptococcus salivarius AT2 and Streptococcus gordonii TH12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10,556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. Even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low pH, such as Streptococcus sobrinus CH125/43, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 12,261 and Actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. Clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low pH is related, not to the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal pH homeostasis.
TI  - Binding properties of streptococcal glucosyltransferases for hydroxyapatite, saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, and bacterial surfaces.
AB  - The binding specificities of Streptococcus glucosyltransferase (Gtf) B, C and D for hydroxyapatite (HA), saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA), and bacterial surfaces were examined. For HA beads the following values were obtained: (K = affinity; N = number of binding sites) GtfB, K = 46 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 0.65 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; GtfC, K = 86 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 4.42 x 10(-6) mumol/m2.; GtfD, K = 100 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 0.83 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. For SHA beads, the following values were obtained: GtfB, K = 14.7 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 1.03 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; GtfC, K = 21.3 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 3.66 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; GtfD, K = 1.73 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 8.88 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. The binding of GtfB to SHA beads was reduced in the presence of parotid saliva, but the binding of GtfC and D was unaffected. The binding of GtfB to SHA in the presence of parotid saliva supplemented with GtfC and D was reduced when compared with its binding to SHA in the presence of parotid saliva alone. In contrast, te binding of GtfC and SHA was unaffected when parotid saliva was supplemented with the other Gtf enzymes. GtfB bound to several bacterial strains (Strep, mutans GS-5, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E and Lactobacillus casei 4646) in an active form, while GtfC and D did not bind to bacterial surfaces. It is concluded that of the three Gtf enzymes, GtfC has the highest affinity for HA and SHA surfaces and can adsorb on the the SHA surface in the presence of the other two enzymes. GtfD also binds to SHA in the presence of the other enzymes but has a very low affinity for the surface. GtfB does not bind to SHA in the presence of the other Gtf enzymes but binds avidly to bacterial surfaces in an active form. Therefore, GtfC most probably binds to apatitic surfaces, while GtfB binds to bacterial surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentine primer containing MDPB after curing.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB) has antibacterial activity before polymerization. Furthermore, the antibacterial agent is immobilized by the polymerization of MDPB and the resin-based material incorporating MDPB is able to show an antibacterial effect even after being cured. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of a dentine primer containing MDPB after curing. METHODS: The inhibitory effect of a cured MDPB-containing primer on the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Lactobacillus casei was determined by the agar-disc method. The bactericidal activity of cured primer during a 1-h contact period was assessed using S. mutans, and the elution of unpolymerized MDPB was measured with high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Cured MDPB-containing primer showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of all species which were in contact with the specimen surface, and displayed a little bactericidal effect on S. mutans without releasing any unpolymerized antibacterial components. CONCLUSION: Incorporation of antibacterial monomer MDPB into dentine primer is beneficial for providing antibacterial activity after curing.
TI  - Acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  - Using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the pH-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results in enhanced survival at low pH. The lower pH limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of Neisseria A182 at pH 6.34; growth of Lactobacillus casei RB1014 stopped at pH 3.81, with species of Actinomyces, Enterococcus, Prevotella and Streptococcus falling between these limits. The working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher pH limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. Adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal pH would trigger the induction of a mechanism that would enhance survival at a pH killing pH 7.5 control cells. The killing pH varied from pH 4.5 for Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 to pH 2.3 for the three Lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three Streptococcus mutans strains killed at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal pH values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the pH list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two pH values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at pH values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at pH 7.5. Predominant among the latter group were the S. mutans and Lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive response exhibited by S. mutans LT11 and S. mutans Ingbritt, involving a process that required protein synthesis. Time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering pH before the acid response was fully functional. These results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as Enterococcus faecalis, to pH values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below pH 3.5.
TI  - Anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  - Reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. As expected, the cations Fe2+ and Cu+ enhanced killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 by hydroperoxides. However, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to O2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. Sensitivities to anaerobic killing by Fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. The oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus rattus FA-1, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 were approximately as sensitive as S. mutans GS-5. Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, and Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 had intermediate sensitivity, while Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Escherichia coli B were insensitive. Killing of S. mutans GS-5 in response to millimolar levels of added Fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. Chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. Sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to Fe2+ exposure. Fe2+, but not Fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of S. mutans. The reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to Fe2+ inhibition of F-ATPase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or F1 enzyme separated from membranes. Cu+ and Cu2+ also inhibited F-ATPase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. All of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  - Dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. The two major calcium-binding sites on Gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). Equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (CWM) from Streptococcus mutans R9, Strep. oralis EF186, Strep. gordonii NCTC 7865, Strep. downei NCTC 11391, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU627 and Lactobacillus casei AC413. This material was stripped of phosphate (PS-CWM) and treated to mask carboxylate groups (CM-CWM). Whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (Strep. downei) to 50 (L. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). Differences in CWM, PS-CWM and CM-CWM calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. These data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing Strep. oralis. In the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.
TI  - Incorporation of antibacterial monomer MDPB into dentin primer.
AB  - The polymerizable monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB) shows antibacterial activity when immobilized in a resin-based material. In this study, the antibacterial effect of a dentin primer incorporating MDPB was investigated. The influence of incorporation of MDPB on bond strength to dentin and on the curing performance of the adhesive system was also evaluated. Experimental primers were prepared by addition of MDPB into a proprietary primer at 1, 2, or 5%. Antibacterial effects of experimental primers were compared with those of control primer and two other proprietary primers by an agar disc-diffusion method and bactericidal activity test. Experimental primers produced greater inhibition zones against Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Lactobacillus casei than any of three proprietary primers, and inhibition increased as the concentration of MDPB was increased. Bactericidal activity of MDPB-containing primers against Streptococcus mutans was greater than those of the other three primers, with incorporation of MDPB at 5% showing complete killing of bacteria after 30 s contact. No decrease in tensile bond strength was observed for materials containing MDPB. On the contrary, the primer incorporating 1 and 2% MDPB showed higher bond strength than all the others, including the control (p < 0.05). When the degree of conversion of the complex of primer and adhesive resin was determined with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, there were no significant differences between any of the experimental primers and the control (p > 0.05). These results indicate that incorporation of the antibacterial monomer MDPB enhanced the antibacterial effect of a proprietary dentin primer before curing, and had no adverse influence on bond strength to dentin and curing of the adhesive system.
TI  - Microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. A class I cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. The blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. In addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of L. Casei with S. sobrinus or A. viscosus were also prepared. Half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the pH of the medium was measured. After 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by Brown-Brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. The final pH of the S. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. Bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the S. salivarius group. Among the monoinfection groups, the S. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the A. Viscosus group and the L. casei group. The invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. Immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by L. casei, and not by S. sobrinus and A. viscosus. The invasion rate by L. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either S. sobrinus or A. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. These findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.
TI  - The effect of environmental pH and fluoride from the substratum on the development of biofilms of selected oral bacteria.
AB  - The present study was initiated to answer the question, "Does fluoride from the substratum influence the accumulation of bacterial cells in an associated biofilm?" 'Fluoride-bound hydroxyapatite' (FHA) and 'fluoride-free hydroxyapatite' (HA) rods were prepared as test and control surfaces, respectively. Biofilms of S. mutans BM71, A. naeslundii genospecies 2 WVU627, and L. casei BM225 accumulated on the surfaces of rods in a semi-defined, mucin-based medium in a chemostat. Culture conditions were varied from pH 4.5 to 7.0 under carbon (glucose) limitation and excess, at a dilution rate of D = 0.1 h-1. Low environmental pH reduced both the numbers of cells on HA surfaces during the early phases (from 0 to 2 h) of accumulation and the final numbers of cells in mature biofilms (20 h). The initial adherence of cells was unaffected by surface fluoride under any of the conditions tested. Similarly, biofilm cells under carbon limitation and those under carbon excess at pH 7.0 were not affected by surface fluoride. However, at low environmental pH values, pH 5.5 for S. mutans and pH 6.0 for A. naeslundii under glucose excess, the accumulation of biofilm cells on the FHA surfaces was significantly reduced (p < 0.05-0.001). Biofilm cell number doubling times of S. mutans and A. naeslundii were increased on FHA relative to HA. Biofilms of L. casei were not significantly affected, even at pH 4.5 in glucose excess. The results confirmed that fluoride from the substratum affected fluoride-sensitive biofilm cells but only under conditions of glucose excess ad low pH.
TI  - Killing of cariogenic bacteria by light from a gallium aluminium arsenide diode laser.
AB  - Suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus were exposed to light from a gallium aluminium arsenide laser in the presence of aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine and the numbers of survivors determined. Exposure to the laser light in the absence of the dye, or the dye in the absence of the laser light, had no significant effect on the viability of the organisms. However, a light-dose-related decrease in the viable count of all four target organisms was found on exposure to the laser light in the presence of the dye. The kills attributable to lethal photosensitization amounted to approximately 10(6) CFU in the case of each organisms. As appreciable kills were achieved within clinically convenient exposure times (30-90 s), these results imply that lethal photosensitization may be a useful technique for eliminating bacteria from carious lesions prior to restoration.
TI  - An in vitro model for adhesion of bacteria to human tooth root surfaces.
AB  - A model mimicking bacterial colonization of dentine has been developed. It employs uniform particles of pulverized human tooth root tissue incubated with radioactively labelled bacteria. After incubation, the number of attaching bacteria is quantified. Attachment of Streptococcus mutans UA140, Actinomyces viscosus T14, and Lactobacillus casei 101 was found to be time dependent and complete within 1-3 h. Dissociation constants (Kd) of the interactions equalled 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.6 x 10(8) cells/ml, for Strep. mutants and A. viscosus, respectively. The Kd for L. casei could not be determined as attachment was not saturable. The putative tissue components involved in adherence were studied by determining the attachment of bacteria in the presence of competing strains. The results suggest that Strep. mutans and A. viscosus recognized and competed for the same ligand (probably collagen) in the dentine. L. casei attachment did not complete with the attachment of Strep. mutans and A. viscosus. Attachment of all strains was modified by preincubation with saliva and varied with bacterial strain and saliva donor.
TI  - Characteristics of accumulation of oral gram-positive bacteria on mucin-conditioned glass surfaces in a model system.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (pH 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of D = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. The accumulation of cells followed four phases. In phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. Phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (Cdt) Streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, Actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and Lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. Cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): Cdt Streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, Actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and Lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. The biofilm stabilized in Phase 4, Cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. The numbers (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were Streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, Actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and Lactobacillus, 2.77. Accumulation increased (Cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. Agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microL each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Of all the compounds tested, Gluma cleanser and Gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Prisma Universal Bond 2 and Superlux Universal Bond 2 systems. The primers of Gluma, Denthesive, and Scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. Zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of Scotchbond 2 and Tripton with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. No inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of XR-Bond on S sanguis and A viscosus was not affected by light curing.
TI  - Sensitisation of cariogenic bacteria to killing by light from a helium-neon laser.
AB  - Suspensions of the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus were exposed to light from a 7.3-mW helium-neon laser in the presence of toluidine blue O. A substantial killing rate (c. 10(6) cfu) of all four species was achieved with a dye concentration of 50 micrograms/ml and a light energy dose of 33.6 J/cm2. This was achieved in 60 s, an exposure time that is clinically acceptable. Exposure to laser light in the absence of the dye did not significantly affect the viability of any of the organisms. This approach may be useful in dentistry to sterilise a carious lesion prior to its repair.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Humoral IgG antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. Their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. The etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral IgG antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years, who were at risk for root-surface caries. Antibody activity to Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt, S. mutans/S. sobrinus GTFs, S. faecalis strain 19433, Actinomyces viscosus strain WVU 626, Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, Lactobacillus casei, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, Eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and Wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by ELISA. Pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. IgG antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject DMF scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between DMF scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. Further relationships between levels of S. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. Numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Multibacterial artificial plaque. A model for studying carious process.
AB  - A multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus. Typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. The caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. The lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. The acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. It is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in the media. Moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  - This study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. Disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of Teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. The bacterial species tested included: A. viscosus, S. mitis, S. mutans, L. casei, and S. sanguis. Growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 mL of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. On other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. All agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. The four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with S. mutans for three days. Adhering materials were disclosed and scored. An ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. The two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. No growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. All four restorative materials reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. Elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  - Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  - The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.
TI  - Microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  - This study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. The caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. A total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. The composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. The microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either Actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and Lactobacillus species (L. casei and L. brevis). Plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, Streptococcus mitis biovar 1, Veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. In the latter samples, individual variations in the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), Actinomyces species (A. viscosus and A. naeslundii), and Veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. These findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.
TI  - Effect of pH on acid production from sorbitol in washed cell suspensions of oral  bacteria.
AB  - The acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. The acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental pH 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. The metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. The results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. Lowering the environmental pH decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. Compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the pH conditions. The total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. Lactic acid, which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. The ratio strong (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. The present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.
TI  - Arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the pH response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  - Thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the pH by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. Only Actinomyces naeslundii and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant pH-rise activity with all three compounds. Eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. Only one, Actinomyces viscosus, produced a pH-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. The remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. The ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. Substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce pH-fall-pH-rise responses shaped like those of the Stephen curve in vivo. In general, addition of arginolytic bacteria made these in vitro pH responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. Because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. Similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a pH-fall-pH-rise type of response. When increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic Lactobacillus casei or Streptococcus mutans, the pH minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the pH-rise became progressively and significantly less. Thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the pH response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. A large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.
TI  - Cariological assessment of leucrose [D-glucopyranosyl-alpha(1----5)-D-fructopyranose] as a sugar substitute.
AB  - Leucrose [D-glucosyl-alpha(1----5)-D-fructopyranose] prepared by microbial-enzymatic transglycosidation from sucrose, is the first alpha(1----5)-linked disaccharide which possesses excellent nutritional properties with regard to metabolic utilization and is well tolerated. The aim of the present work was to assess its cariogenic potential. Yeast invertase was shown to be inhibited by leucrose in a noncompetitive way, while hydrogenated leucrose (leucritol) acted as an activator. Plaque polysaccharide forming glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus cricetus AHT were not influenced by leucrose, but by leucritol. Essentially no acid formation was observed after incubation of leucrose with suspensions of human dental plaque, S. mutans NCTC 10449, Lactobacillus casei LSB 132 and Actinomyces viscosus Ny 1 No. 30. Leucrose was a competitive inhibitor of the acid formation from sucrose by S. mutans NCTC 10449 at neutral pH. Furthermore, leucrose inhibited at neutral pH considerably the uptake of sucrose by S. mutans NCTC 10449. The uptake of fructose and maltose was also inhibited but that of glucose not at all. In Cara rats as the animal model, leucrose was compared to sucrose and to corn starch for its cariogenic potential. In sharp contrast to the group fed with 30% sucrose, caries scores of the 30% leucrose group were not significantly different from the starch group. pH telemetry with an indwelling electrode in man proved lueucrose to be 'safe for teeth' since plaque pH did not drop below pH 5.7. Leucrose is a novel noncariogenic disaccharide and thus represents a highly promising sugar substitute for caries prevention.
TI  - Degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  - Selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. S. sanguis IUOM-11M and JC804, S. mutans 6715, S. salivarius IUOM-8, A. viscosus IUOM-62, and A. naeslundii ATCC 12104 degraded all four substrates. S. mutans NCTC 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while A. viscosus ATCC 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and S. sanguis SS34 degraded only maltose. L. casei IUOM-14 did not degrade any of the substrates. Analysis of starch degradation products from S. sanguis IUOM-11M and A. viscosus IUOM-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose, and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. S. sanguis IUOM-11M alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. The presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. Maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of S. sanguis IUOM-11M insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. Maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. Several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. These products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of the acidogenic substrate fructose. The results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.
TI  - Microbial caries induction in the roots of human teeth in vitro.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans GS5, Lactobacillus casei DSM20011 and Actinomyces viscosus T14 produce artificial caries in the roots of extracted teeth. Roots were coated with wax leaving an 8 mm2 window exposed on the buccal surfaces, and then incubated for 8 days in the presence of the test organism, the synthetic medium being changed each day. Samples were then examined by SEM, or microradiographs were obtained from 120 microns sections. The pH at the root surface at the end of the induction averaged 4.43, 5.00 and 5.20, and the lesion depths measured on the microradiographs averaged 121, 83 and 34 microns, for Strep. mutans, L. casei and A. viscosus respectively. This relationship between pH and lesion depth confirms earlier findings. As all of these organisms can produce lesions in tooth structure, elimination of one type would probably not eliminate caries.
TI  - Membrane ATPases and acid tolerance of Actinomyces viscosus and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E were found to differ markedly in acid tolerance. For example, pH profiles for glycolysis of intact cells in dense suspensions indicated that glycolysis by L. casei had an optimal pH of about 6.0 and that glucose degradation was reduced by 50% at a pH of 4.2. Comparable values for A. viscosus cells were at pHs of about 7.0 and 5.6. The difference in acid tolerance appeared to depend mainly on membrane physiology, and the addition of 40 microM gramicidin to cell suspensions increased the sensitivity of the glycolytic system by as much as 1.5 pH units for L. casei and up to 0.5 pH unit for A. viscosus. L. casei cells were inherently somewhat more resistant to severe acid damage than were A. viscosus cells, in that Mg release from L. casei cells in medium with a pH of 3.0 occurred only after a lag of some 4 h, compared with rapid release from A. viscosus cells. However, the major differences pertinent to the physiology of the organisms appeared to be related to proton-translocating ATPases. Isolated membranes of L. casei had about 3.29 U of ATPase per mg of protein, compared with only about 0.06 U per mg of protein for those of A. viscosus. Moreover, the ATPase of L. casei had a pH optimum for hydrolytic activity of about 5, compared with an optimal pH of about 7 for that of A. viscosus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Calcium-dependent salivary agglutinin with reactivity to various oral bacterial species.
AB  - Human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of Streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b, c, d, and e and strains of Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis. The desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.154 M sodium chloride. After another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. The L. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. However, all strains, including the nonagglutinating L. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. The agglutinin extracts from S. mutans serotype c, S. sanguis, and A. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. The purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. All agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mM to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. This type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.
TI  - The effect of lowering the pH on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  - Nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at D = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. After an initial period of steady-state growth at pH 7.0, pH control was discontinued. The pH then decreased until it stabilized at pH 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the Eh rose from -165 mV to +160 mV. The lowering in pH resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. At pH 7.0, 'Streptococcus mitior', Veillonella alcalescens and S. sanguis were most numerous while at pH 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for Lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. The proportions of S. mutans within the community also increased while S. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and Bacteroides intermedius was not detected below pH 4.6. The survival at pH 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. Relative to pH 7.0, the community growing at pH 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider pH range but amino acid metabolism decreased. In general, when pH control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for B. intermedius, which was still not detected. The inverse relationship between S. sanguis and S. mutans, and the increase in proportions of L. casei and S. mutans during growth in a low pH environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies directed against Streptococcus mutans strain JBP lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were characterized. They were all similarly reactive with the immunizing LTA-containing extract, with intact Strep. mutans JBP cells and with LTA purified from Lactobacillus casei. Immobilized anti-LTA antibodies removes LTA from LTA-containing extracts. The binding of antibodies to LTA was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated LTA, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. Antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of Strep. mutans, as well as with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and L. casei, but not with LTA-negative species Streptococcus mitis or Actinomyces viscosus. Anti-LTA antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of Strep. mutans JBP to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. There was no effect of anti-LTA antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by Strep. mutans. The results argue against a major role for LTA in Strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.
TI  - Immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  - Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified Streptococcus mutans L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. The enzyme affinity for pyruvate or NADH decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. A partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with FDP prior to the antibody adjunction. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when FDP was added. The protective effect observed with FDP could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. A decrease of antibody binding in the presence of FDP was also obtained with S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. NADH did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. On the contrary, pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. A decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - pH change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (G-Tase)-together with either Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, or Lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. The pH in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. In the absence of GTase, the bacteria other than S. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. The pH of the plaque formed with GTase alone did not show the pH decrease seen when the plaque contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.
TI  - Lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) from Streptococcus mutans OMZ175 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, DEAE-Sephacel and Blue-Sepharose CL.6B chromatography, and Sephacryl S200 gel permeation. The catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between pH 5 and 6.2. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was around 0.02 mM and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. The enzyme seemed to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. Increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mM enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. The enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to NADH, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a Hill coefficient of about 1.9. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on Sephacryl S200. Monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. Antibodies obtained against the purified S. mutans OMZ175 LDH cross-reacted with the sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of LDHs from different S. mutans serotypes, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, and Actinomyces viscosus NY 1. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of L-LDHs from S. mutans serotypes and S. sanguis. Cross-reactions were also observed with the LDHs from A. viscosus and L. casei, the latter being the least related. A very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the L-LDH from S. mutans OMZ175 and the D-LDH from Lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be detected with mammal LDHs.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies of cellular lysis of oral bacteria by a lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system.
AB  - Compared with anion-activated cell lysis of oral bacteria damaged with either lysozyme or trypsin, cells which were treated with both of these enzymes showed a far greater degree of lysis. This was true regardless of whether turbidimetric, DNA release, or electron microscopic assays were used to monitor the lytic process. At an acidic pH of 5.2 and an NaHCO3 concentration of 100 mM, the kinetics of lysis for two different serotype c strains of Streptococcus mutans were similar. At 0 to 100 mM bicarbonate, however, differences in the lytic susceptibilities of the two strains were evident. At pH 5.2, NaHCO3, but not NaSCN, NaCl, or NaF, was effective in promoting cell lysis of the oral bacteria. At apparent sublytic concentrations of NaHCO3, lysis was achieved by adding appropriate concentrations of NaSCN, NaCl, or NaF to the lysozyme-protease-damaged cells. In in vivo studies, hamsters given a combination of NaHCO3, NaCl, and NaSCN were found to have significantly reduced levels of S. mutans on their molar teeth compared with that found in controls or animals exposed to any one of the salts alone or to a combination of chloride and thiocyanate only. The results suggest that bicarbonate is an essential anion which, together with the other major salivary inorganic monovalent anions, plays an active role in the lysis and ultimate elimination of cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Effects of alpha-amylase on dental plaque bacteria].
AB  
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.
TI  - Human serum precipitins to human dental plaque and oral bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - The effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V to tooth surfaces were assessed by using the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) in vitro system. Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T14V was not inhibited in the presence of Streptococcus mutans GS5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T14V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M5 during strain T14V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T14V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G9B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T14V. Conversely, the presence of strain T14V markedly increased the attachment of S. sanguis M5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the attachment of S. sanguis G9B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T14V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G9B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M5 or G9B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T14V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T14V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T14V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T14V to human epithelial cells.
TI  - Method for the lysis of Gram-positive, asporogenous bacteria with lysozyme.
AB  - A method developed for the lysis of oral streptococci that employed the action of lysozyme suspended in dilute tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer containing polyethylene glycol has been adapted for use with lactobacilli, actinomycetes, propionibacteria, and pediococci. Most of the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid was liberated from many strains of bacteria usually thought to be lysozyme resistant. The major observations were as follows: (i) supplementation of the growth medium with L-threonine, L-lysine, or both frequently produced cells that were more susceptible to lysis by lysozyme; (ii) glucose-containing media produced cells that were more easily lysed than those from cultures grown on other substrates; (iii) polyethylene glycol not only served as an osmotic stabilizer, it also enhanced the extent of lysis; and (iv) dilute tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer was superior to the buffer systems most commonly employed in published muramidase-based lysis techniques. Stationary-phase cells of Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus mutans were more easily lysed than those isolated from log-phase cultures. The method as detailed in this report should be generally applicable for the lysis of gram-positive, asporogenous bacteria.
TI  - Lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  - The respiratory quinones of 73 strains of Gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. Menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (MK-7) were the main quinone type found in representatives of the genus Bacillus and in Sporolactobacillus inulinus. However, a strain of B. thuringiensis produced MK-8 in addition to MK-7, and strains of B. lentus and B. pantothenticus appeared to produce MK-9 and MK-8, respectively, with no MK-7. In the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in Pediococcus cerevisiae NCTC 8066 and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, which contained menaquinones, and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 and HIM 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. Menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes (except Actinomyces odontolyticus and Bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in Protaminobacter alboflavus ATCC 8458, the so-called Actinobacillus actinoides ATCC 15900 and Noguchia granulosis NCTC 10559.
TI  - Bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Opsonization of Streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. Opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed Strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera from sham-immunized monkeys. Antibodies to Strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. There was little or no opsonization with Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei, Strep, sanguis and Strep. salivarius. The exception was Strep. CHT which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. The results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of Strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.
TI  - Sucrose metabolism by prominent members of the flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaques.
AB  - Sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. Streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, or Lactobacillus casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. The Actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and S. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. The metabolic activity of S. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the Actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
TI  - Toxic properties of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The biological activity of Odontomyces viscosus, which has been reported to cause periodontal disease in hamsters, was examined. The microorganism was cultured anaerobically in Brain Heart Infusion broth, and the cells were harvested. The washed cells were injected intradermally into the abdomen of rabbits. After 72 hr, a well-defined, firm, raised nodule (about 1.0 by 1.5 cm) with an erythematous border was seen at the injection site. Suspensions of cell wall and cytoplasmic material were injected intradermally, and the lesions appeared only at the site of cell wall injection. The cell walls, which were then treated with trypsin, pepsin, and ribonuclease, again produced the characteristic lesion. These nodular dermal lesions persisted for a minimal time of 10 days. The enzymatically treated cell walls were then hydrolyzed with 1 n HCl, and such hydrolysis up to 1 hr failed to alter the toxic activity of the cell walls. Similar dermal nodular lesions were obtained by injection of enzymatically treated cell walls of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus groups B, C, E, F, K, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces israelii. Treatment with hot and cold trichloroacetic acid solutions and proteolytic enzymes, or with formamide, yielded insoluble fractions which produced the characteristic nodular lesions. The size of the lesion resulting from injection of these fractions was proportional to the amount of the injected material. The active fraction, which does not appear susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme, is thought to be cell wall mucopeptide. Histological studies showed skin abscesses due to the toxic reaction; however, in addition to the acute inflammatory reaction, there was local eosinophilia.
