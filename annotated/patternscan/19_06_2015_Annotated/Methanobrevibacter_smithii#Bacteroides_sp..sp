TI  == hubac and nifh source tracking markers display a relationship to land use but not rainfall.
AB  == identification of the source of fecal pollution is becoming a priority for states and territories in the u.s. in order to meet water quality standards and to develop and implement total maximum daily loads. the goal of this research was to relate microbial source tracking (mst) assay concentrations to land use and levels of impervious surfaces in order to gauge how increasing development is associated with human fecal contamination in inland watersheds. the concentrations of two proposed mst markers, targeting nifh of methanobrevibacter  smithii and hubac of bacteroides sp., were positively correlated with increasing  anthropogenic development and impervious surfaces. higher concentrations of these mst markers in more urbanized watersheds suggest that increasing development negatively affects water quality. neither mst marker concentration was correlated with antecedent rainfall levels, and detection of markers did not differ between  dry weather and rain events. water samples were also analyzed for norovirus and enterovirus, but these enteric viruses were rarely detected. these mst results differ from previous studies that have found correlations between traditional fecal indicator bacteria (fib) and antecedent rainfall. this difference suggests  that the mst markers used in this study may be more specific for recent, land-based contamination events as opposed to resuspension of particle-associated organisms in waterways. hubac was detected in 98% of samples, correlating with fecal coliform and escherichia coli concentrations. the ubiquity of the hubac marker in our samples suggests that this marker does not provide sufficiently different or additional information than fib, and it is likely this marker was amplifying non-human targets. the nifh marker was detected in 30% of samples. less than half of the nifh-positive samples contained levels of fecal coliforms or e. coli above regulatory thresholds, suggesting that nifh would be more useful when utilized simultaneously with fib than in a tiered monitoring strategy. the results of this research suggests that land use factors play an important role in characterizing and mitigating fecal contamination in watersheds.

TI  == association of fecal indicator bacteria with human viruses and microbial source tracking markers at coastal beaches impacted by nonpoint source pollution.
AB  == water quality was assessed at two marine beaches in california by measuring the concentrations of culturable fecal indicator bacteria (fib) and by library-independent microbial source tracking (mst) methods targeting markers of  human-associated microbes (human polyomavirus [hpyv] pcr and quantitative pcr, methanobrevibacter smithii pcr, and bacteroides sp. strain hf183 pcr) and a human pathogen (adenovirus by nested pcr). fib levels periodically exceeded regulatory  thresholds at doheny and avalon beaches for enterococci (28.5% and 31.7% of samples, respectively) and fecal coliforms (20% and 5.8%, respectively). adenoviruses were detected at four of five sites at doheny beach and were correlated with detection of hpyvs and human bacteroides hf183; however, adenoviruses were not detected at avalon beach. the most frequently detected human source marker at both beaches was bacteroides hf183, which was detected in  27% of samples. correlations between fibs and human markers were much more frequent at doheny beach than at avalon beach; e.g., adenovirus was correlated with hpyvs and hf183. human sewage markers and adenoviruses were routinely detected in samples meeting fib regulatory standards. the toolbox approach of fib measurement coupled with analysis of several mst markers targeting human pathogens used here demonstrated that human sewage is at least partly responsible for the degradation of water quality, particularly at doheny beach, and resulted  in a more definitive assessment of recreational water quality and human health risk than reliance on fib concentrations alone could have provided.
