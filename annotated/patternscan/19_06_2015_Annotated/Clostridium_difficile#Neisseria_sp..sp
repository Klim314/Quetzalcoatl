TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).
