[lactobacillus inhibit adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells].
to assess the ability of the previously selected human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus) t79-3, t90-1 and lactobacillus jensenii (l. jensenii) t118-3, t231-1 to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus and block their adhesion to hela cells. the inhibitory bioactive substances produced by these lactobacillus were also identified. inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method on agar plates. three types of interaction were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus on adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells: exclusion group (lactobacillus and hela followed by pathogens), competition group (lactobacillus, hela and pathogens together) and displacement group (pathogens and hela followed by the addition of lactobacillus). the number of hela cells adhered to staphylococcus aureus was quantified by bacteria colony counts on lb plate. the results showed that lactic acids produced by the lactobacillus are the main substances that can inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and there is variation among the three types of interaction regarding the inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus. the effects of lactobacillus on blocking the adhesion to hela cells were concentration dependent. all four lactobacillus isolates displayed the ability to inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and block staphylococcus aureus adherence to hela cells. exclusion group was the most effective, and t79-3 showed greater capacity to block staphylococcus aureus adherence compared with the other three isolates. the present study suggests the potential ability of l. crispatus t79-3 as probiotic for the treatment and prevention of urogenital infections in women.
lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats, especially the composition of lactobacillus species.
inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.
comparison of the growth and hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal probiotic lactobacilli under different culture conditions.
objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the optimal conditions for  the growth and hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal lactobacilli. study design: two vaginal lactobacillus strains were cultured under different growth conditions (temperature, ph, agitation, and growth media) with a fractional factorial experimental design. results: the optimal growth conditions of lactobacillus paracasei crl (centro de referencia para lactobacilus culture collection) 1289 and lactobacillus crispatus crl 1266 were temperature 37 degrees c and initial ph 6.5, nonagitated cultures, in autolysat de levure; peptone, tryptone, tween 80 et glucose (laptg) broth for l paracasei or in de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs) and laptg broths for l crispatus. the hydrogen peroxide production, detected only in agitated cultures, was higher at 37 degrees c and ph 6.5. the oxidative metabolite produced the self-inhibition of the lactobacilli growth. in mixed cultures of lactobacilli and staphylococcus aureus under the optimal conditions of hydrogen peroxide production, the pathogen growth was inhibited. conclusion: the results provided information about the factors that affect the hydrogen peroxide production and about the most favorable conditions with which to obtain the highest biomass in the shortest possible time.
selection of vaginal h2o2-generating lactobacillus species for probiotic use.
lactobacilli are believed to contribute to the control of the vaginal microflora  by different mechanisms such as production of antagonistic substances like lactic acid, bacteriocins, and h2o2. this paper describes the selection of h2o2-generating lactobacilli among 35 hydrophobic isolates from the human vagina. lactobacillus crispatus f117, which generated the highest h2o2 level, was chosen to study: (a) the kinetics of h2o2 production considering different culture conditions, and (b) the effect of this metabolite on the growth of urogenital tract pathogens. the levels of h2o2 in l. crispatus supernatant increased during its growth and were maximum at the early stationary phase (3.29 mmol h2o2 l-1) under aerated conditions (agitated cultures). in nonagitated cultures there were no detectable levels of h2o2. l. crispatus f117 spent supernatant inhibited staphylococcus aureus growth in plaque assay. inhibition was due to h2o2 since catalase treatment of the supernatant suppressed inhibition. in mixed cultures performed with l. crispatus and s. aureus a significant decrease in pathogen growth was observed. the inhibitory effect depended on the initial inoculum of s. aureus. further evaluation of the properties of l. crispatus f117 will be performed to consider its inclusion in a probiotic for local use in the vaginal tract.
