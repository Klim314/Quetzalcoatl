TI  - Levels of Selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P. gingivalis and S. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. There were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of P. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), S. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and Selenomonas dianae (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone EW076) (r = 0.42, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. sputigena and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated further.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  - Dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (TR)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (TRD). This was diluted so that the antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. Microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers specific for the V2-V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rRNA gene (rDNA). Dominant isolates and PCR amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. TRD caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion of lactobacilli. DGGE indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria and showed that a Porphyromonas sp. and Selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by TRD. Pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Neisseria subflava, Prevotella nigrescens, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to TR, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least susceptible. Clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of TR activity. The mean MICs of TR, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin V, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5 days of exposure to TRD showed few significant changes. In conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to TRD showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
