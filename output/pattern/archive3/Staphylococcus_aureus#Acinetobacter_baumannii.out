hydroxy tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone oxabicyclooctane-linked novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents-sar of rhs moiety (part-3).
novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (nbtis) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial gyrase a and parc and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (r)-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (lhs) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (rhs) containing nbtis showed a potent gram-positive antibacterial profile. sar around the rhs moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. a fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an mic against staphylococcus aureus of 0.5mug/ml with reduced functional herg activity (ic50 333mum) and good in vivo efficacy [ed90 12mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. a pyridodioxane-containing nbti showed a s. aureus mic of 0.5mug/ml, significantly improved herg ic50 764mum and strong efficacy of 11mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). a phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent herg binding activity. many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best rhs moiety for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked nbtis.
bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
trends in paediatric bloodstream infections at a south african referral hospital.
background: the epidemiology of paediatric bloodstream infection (bsi) in sub-saharan africa is poorly documented with limited data on hospital-acquired sepsis, impact of hiv infection, bsi trends and antimicrobial resistance. methods: we retrospectively reviewed paediatric bsi (0-14 years) at tygerberg children's hospital between 1 january 2008 and 31 december 2013 (excluding neonatal wards). laboratory and hospital data were used to determine bsi rates, blood culture contamination, pathogen profile, patient demographics, antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with mortality. fluconazole resistant candida species, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial resistant pathogens. results: of 17001 blood cultures over 6 years, 935 cultures isolated 979 pathogens (5.5% yield; 95% ci 5.3-5.7%). contamination rates were high (6.6%, 95% ci 6.4-6.8%), increasing over time (p = 0.003). discrete bsi episodes were identified (n = 864) with median patient age of 7.5 months, male predominance (57%) and 13% hiv prevalence. bsi rates declined significantly over time (4.6-3.1, overall rate 3.5 per 1000 patient days; 95% ci 3.3-3.7; chi square for trend p = 0.02). gram negative pathogens predominated (60% vs 33% gram positives and 7% fungal); klebsiella pneumoniae (154; 17%), staphylococcus aureus (131; 14%) and escherichia coli (97; 11%) were most prevalent. crude bsi mortality was 20% (176/864); hiv infection, fungal, gram negative and hospital-acquired sepsis were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. hospital-acquired bsi was common (404/864; 47%). overall antimicrobial resistance rates were high (70% in hospital vs 25% in community-acquired infections; p < 0.0001); hospital-acquired infection, infancy, hiv-infection and gram negative sepsis were associated with resistance. s. pneumoniae bsi declined significantly over time (58/465 [12.5%] to 33/399 [8.3%]; p =0.04). conclusion: although bsi rates declined over time, children with bsi had high mortality and pathogens exhibited substantial antimicrobial resistance in both community and hospital-acquired infections. blood culture sampling technique and local options for empiric antimicrobial therapy require re-evaluation.
kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.
rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the icu.
epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii.
introduction: acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of infections in hospitals around the world, which is very difficult to control and treat. it is particularly prevalent in intensive care wards. aim: the main objective of the research was to establish the application of epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections (nis) caused by a. baumannii in order to determine: the type and distribution of nis, and to investigate antimicrobial drug resistance of a. baumannii. material and methods: 855 patients treated at the clinic of anesthesiology and reanimation, university clinical center tuzla during 2013 were followed prospectively for the development of nis. infections caused by a. baumannii were characterized by the anatomical site and antibiotics resistance profile. results: nis were registered in 105 patients (12.3%; 855/105). the predominant cause of infection was a. baumannii with an incidence of 51.4% (54/105), followed by esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae with 15.2% (16/105) of cases, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with 8.6% (9/105), and esbl-producing proteus mirabilis with 7.6% (8/105). according to the anatomical site, and type of nis caused by a. baumannii, the most frequent were respiratory infections (74.1%; 40/54). infections of surgical sites were registered in 11.1% (6/54) of cases, while bloodstream infections in 9.2% (5/54). a. baumannii isolates tested resistant against most antibiotics examined, but showed a high degree of susceptibility to tobramycin (87%; 47/54) and colistin (100%; 54/54). conclusion: the increasing incidence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant acinetobacter spp. emphasizes the importance of administration of an adequate antibiotic strategy and the implementation of strict monitoring of the measures for controlling nosocomial infections.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of a. retroflexus.
in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 mul/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtills, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (candida albicans, c. famata, c. utilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic determination) for antimicrobial activity and teac (trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. the adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of a. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. the extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis with no activity against s. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against c. famata by both extracts. the a. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the p. aeruginosa clinical strain. the inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on b. subtilis strain. the antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
the purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest china. antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients per day (ddds/100 pds). hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 ddds/100 pds (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). the resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. the medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of p. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and k. pneumoniae to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). the decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. it also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.
acinetobacter baumannii universal stress protein a plays a pivotal role in stress response and is essential for pneumonia and sepsis pathogenesis.
acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most significant threats to global public health. this threat is compounded by the fact that a. baumannii is rapidly becoming resistant to all relevant antimicrobials. identifying key microbial factors through which a. baumannii resists hostile host environment is paramount to the development of novel antimicrobials targeting infections caused by this emerging pathogen. an attractive target could be a molecule that plays a role in the pathogenesis and stress response of a. baumannii. accordingly, the universal stress protein a (uspa) was chosen to be fully investigated in this study. a platform of a. baumannii constructs, expressing various levels of the uspa gene ranging from zero to thirteen folds of wild-type level, and a recombinant e. coli strain, were employed to investigate the role of uspa in vitro stress and in vivo pathogenesis. the uspa protein plays a significant role in protecting a. baumannii from h(2)o(2), low ph, and the respiratory toxin 2,4-dnp. a. baumannii uspa protein plays an essential role in two of the deadliest types of infection caused by a. baumannii; pneumonia and sepsis. this distinguishes a. baumannii uspa from its closely related homolog, the staphylococcus aureus usp2, as well as from the less similar burkholderia glumae usps. heterologous and overexpression experiments suggest that uspa mediates its role via an indirect mechanism. our study highlights the role of uspa as an important contributor to the a. baumannii stress and virulence machineries, and polishes it as a plausible target for new therapeutics.
anti-cancer, immunoregulatory, and antimicrobial activities of the frog skin host-defense peptides pseudhymenochirin-1pb and pseudhymenochirin-2pa.
pseudhymenochirin-1pb (ps-1pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2pa (ps-2pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog pseudhymenochirus merlini (pipidae). ps-1pb and ps-2pa are highly cytotoxic (lc50<12 mum) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (lc50=28+/-2 mum for ps-1pb and lc50=6+/-1 mum for ps-2pa). ps-2pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (lc50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (huvec) cells=68+/-2 mum). ps-1pb and ps-2pa (5 mug/ml) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 and the multifunctional cytokine il-6 from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/6 mice and enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-23 from both unstimulated and lps-stimulated macrophages. ps-1pb potently (mic</=10 mum) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. ps-2pa shows the same high potency (mic</=10 mum) against the gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the gram-negative isolates. ps-1pb at 4xmic kills 99.9% of escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of s. aureus within 180 min. in conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the ps-1pb and ps-2pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and ricu.
background: lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. this study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lrtis. methods: the clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 lrti patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of xiangya hospital (changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. results: the infection rate of gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and ricu (p<0.05). the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05), whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection is less in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05). in the general ward, the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (p<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (p<0.05). in the ricu, the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (p>0.05). staphylococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and ricu (41.66-54.87%), respectively (p>0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and ricu (29.60-33.88%), respectively (p>0.05). streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. conclusions: the distribution and drug sensitivity of lrti pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and ricu. streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in lrtis in some areas of china.
evaluation of the effectiveness of an infection control program in adult intensive care units: a report from a middle-income country.
background: the rates of hand hygiene improvement and health care-associated infections (hais) were evaluated after the introduction in 2004 of an infection surveillance and prevention program at a university teaching hospital in a low- to middle-income country. methods: data on hand hygiene compliance, hai rate, multiresistant organisms, and antibiotic consumption in 4 adult intensive care units (icus; medical, general surgery, anesthesiology and reanimation, and neurosurgery) were collected retrospectively for each year from 2004 to 2012. negative binomial regression modeling with a log link was used to adjust for overdispersion in observations, and the first year of observations served as the baseline for comparing changes in incidence rate ratio (irr) over the subsequent years. results: total hand hygiene compliance improved from 30.5% in 2004 to 43.5% by 2010 (irr, 1.3; p <.0001) and reached 63.8% by 2012 (irr, 1.9; p < .0001). the hai rate was 42.6/1,000 patient-days at baseline and increased significantly thereafter until 2012, when it decreased by 20% to 33.6/1,000 patient-days (irr, 0.8; p = .001). the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was 7.85 (95% confidence interval [ci], 5.89-10.26)/1,000 catheter-days in 2004 and increased to 12.4 (95% ci, 9.98-14.39)/1,000 catheter-days in 2012 (irr, 1.5; p = .024). the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia remained stable from the 2004 baseline rate of 31.66/1,000 ventilator-days to the 2012 rate of 24.04/ 1,000 ventilator-days (irr, 0.88; p = .574). the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remained relatively stable between 2004 and 2012 (from 7.92/1,000 catheter-days to 4.97/1,000 catheter-days; p = .101). the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection was 6.24/1,000 patient-days at baseline and decreased significantly to 0.73/1,000 patient-days by 2007 (irr, 0.13; p <.001) and continued to remain below 2/1,000 patient-days for the next 5 years. the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection decreased significantly from 8.66/1,000 patient-days in 2004 to 6.09/1,000 patient-days in 2010 (irr, 0.72; p = .026) and to 5.44/1,000 patient-days by 2012 (irr, 0.63; p = .002). the rate of acinetobacter baumannii infection was 14.3/1,000 patient-days at baseline, decreased significantly by 2005 (irr, 0.73; p = .012), fluctuated between 2006 and 2010, and then decreased significantly to 10.44/1,000 patient-days in 2011 (irr, 0.74; p = .007) and then to 7.6/1,000 patient-days in 2012 (irr, 0.53; p < .001). antibiotic consumption did not decrease noticeably over the 9-year study period. conclusions: hand hygiene improved in all of the icus evaluated. measuring changes in hai rates in a single health care setting can be statistically challenging, and a bias in the detection rates is not uncommon in the early years of a new infection prevention program. here, for the first time, implementation of an infection surveillance and prevention program was associated with a reduction in hai rate.
microbiology, resistance patterns, and risk factors of mortality in ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in a northern thai tertiary-care university based general surgical intensive care unit.
background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) occurrence, causative pathogens, and resistance patterns in surgical intensive care units (sicu) are different between western and developing asian countries. in thailand, resistant organisms have progressively increased in the last decade. however, the evidence describing causes of vap and its outcomes, especially secondary to resistant pathogens, in asian developing countries' sicus is very limited. therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence, pathogen characteristics, and risk factors that impact mortality and patient survival following vap in a tertiary northern thai sicu. methods: between 2008 and 2012, vap occurred in a total of 150 patients in chiang mai university's general sicus (6.3+/-2.8 cases per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days). the following clinical data were collected from 46 patients who died and 104 patients who survived: microbiologic results, susceptible patterns, and survival status at hospital discharge. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were classified as susceptible, multidrug resistant (mdr), extensively drug resistant (xdr), and pan-drug resistant (pdr). the hazard ratio (hr) was calculated for risk factor analysis. results: regarding the microbiology, gram negative organisms were the major pathogens (n=142, 94.7%). the first three most common organisms were acinetobacter baumannii (38.7% of all organisms, mortality 41.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%, mortality 30.8%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%, mortality 16%) respectively. the most common gram positive organism was staphylococcus aureus (4.0%, mortality 50%). the median day of vap occurrence were significantly different between the three groups (p<0.01): susceptible (day 4), mdr (day 5), and xdr (day 6.5). only half of all vap cases were caused by susceptible organisms. antibiotic resistance was demonstrated by 49.3% of the gram negative organisms and 62.5% of the gram positive organisms. extensive drug resistance was evident only in acinetobacter baumannii (30.6%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.3%). no pan-drug resistance was found during surveillance. the significant hr risk factors were age (p=0.03), resistant organisms (p=0.04), xdr (p=0.02), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score (<0.01). acinetobacter baumannii (p=0.06) and intubation due to severe sepsis (p=0.08) demonstrated a trend toward a significant increase in the hr. on the other hand, there were significantly decreased hrs in trauma patients (p=0.01). initial administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy had a tendency toward a significant decrease in the hr (p=0.08). conclusion: gram negative organisms were the primary cause of bacterial vap in chiang mai university's general sicu. resistant strains were present in half of all vap cases and were associated with the day of vap onset. regarding risk factors, age, acute physiology, chronic health evaluation ii score, resistant organisms (especially xdr), and being a non-trauma patient increased the risk of mortality.
rapid efficient synthesis and characterization of silver, gold, and bimetallic nanoparticles from the medicinal plant plumbago zeylanica and their application in biofilm control.
background: nanoparticles (nps) have gained significance in medical fields due to their high surface-area-to-volume ratio. in this study, we synthesized nps from a medicinally important plant - plumbago zeylanica. materials and methods: aqueous root extract of p. zeylanica (pzre) was analyzed for the presence of flavonoids, sugars, and organic acids using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (hptlc), gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (gc-tof-ms), and biochemical methods. the silver nps (agnps), gold nps (aunps), and bimetallic nps (agaunps) were synthesized from root extract and characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectra, x-ray diffraction (xrd), energy-dispersive spectrometry (eds), transmission electron microscopy (tem), and dynamic light scattering (dls). the effects of these nps on acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli biofilms were studied using quantitative biofilm inhibition and disruption assays, as well as using fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. results: pzre showed the presence of phenolics, such as plumbagin, and flavonoids, in addition to citric acid, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch, using hptlc, gc-tof-ms, and quantitative analysis. bioreduction of silver nitrate (agno(3)) and chloroauric acid (haucl(4)) were confirmed at absorbances of 440 nm (agnps), 570 nm (aunps), and 540 nm (agaunps), respectively. the maximum rate of synthesis at 50 degrees c was achieved with 5 mm agno(3) within 4.5 hours for agnps; and with 0.7 mm haucl4 within 5 hours for aunps. the synthesis of agaunps, which completed within 90 minutes with 0.7 mm agno(3) and haucl(4), was found to be the fastest. fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed bioreduction, while eds and xrd patterns confirmed purity and the crystalline nature of the nps, respectively. tem micrographs and dls showed about 60 nm monodispersed ag nanospheres, 20-30 nm au nanospheres adhering to form au nanotriangles, and about 90 nm hexagonal blunt-ended agaunps. these nps also showed antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against e. coli, a. baumannii, s. aureus, and a mixed culture of a. baumannii and s. aureus. agnps inhibited biofilm in the range of 96%-99% and agaunps from 93% to 98% in single-culture biofilms. aunps also showed biofilm inhibition, with the highest of 98% in s. aureus. agnps also showed good biofilm disruption, with the highest of 88% in a. baumannii. conclusion: this is the first report on rapid and efficient synthesis of agnps, aunps and agaunps from p. zeylanica and their effect on quantitative inhibition and disruption of bacterial biofilms.
polyethyleneimine and polyethyleneimine-based nanoparticles: novel bacterial and  yeast biofilm inhibitors.
biofilms are commonly involved in medical device-related infections. the purpose  of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of polyethyleneimine (pei) and pei-based nanoparticles (nanopei) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans (clinical and atcc strains), and to evaluate their effect upon biofilm formation on polyurethane (pur)-like catheters. mics and minimal lethal concentrations of pei and nanopei were determined according to clsi microdilution reference protocols. for pei, the mic value was 195.31 mg l(-1) for all the bacteria and 48.83 mg l(-1) for the yeast strains. for nanopei, the mic value was 1250 mg l(-1) for all the strains except a. baumannii, for which it was 2500 mg l(-1). biofilm formation was assessed with pur-like catheter segments and biofilm metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. plasma membrane integrity and membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry after staining microbial cells with a membrane-impermeable dye, propidium iodide, and a membrane-potential marker, dibac4(3). pei inhibited growth of all microbial species; higher concentrations of nanopei were needed to inhibit growth of all species. biofilm formation in the presence of anti-bacterial pei activity was dose-dependent (except for s. epidermidis) and species-related. nanopei at 0.5xmic and mic significantly reduced the metabolic activity of biofilms of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii, whereas 2xmic was required in order to inhibit biofilm metabolic activity.
differential protection from tobramycin by extracellular polymeric substances from acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus biofilms.
we investigated biofilms of two pathogens, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus, to characterize mechanisms by which the extracellular polymeric substance (eps) found in biofilms can protect bacteria against tobramycin exposure. to do so, it is critical to study eps-antibiotic interactions in a homogeneous environment without mass transfer limitations. consequently, we developed a method to grow biofilms, harvest eps, and then augment planktonic cultures with isolated eps and tobramycin. we demonstrated that planktonic cultures respond differently to being treated with different types of eps (a. baumannii versus s. aureus) in the presence of tobramycin. by harvesting eps from the biofilms, we found that a. baumannii eps acts as a "universal protector" by inhibiting tobramycin activity against bacterial cells regardless of species; s. aureus eps did not show any protective ability in cell cultures. adding mg(2+) or ca(2+) reduced the protective effect of a. baumannii eps. finally, when we selectively digested the proteins or dna of the eps, we found that the protective ability did not change, suggesting that neither has a significant role in protection. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates how eps protects pathogens against antibiotics in a homogeneous system without mass transfer limitations. our results suggest that eps protects biofilm communities, in part, by adsorbing antibiotics near the surface. this may limit antibiotic diffusion to the bottom of the biofilms but is not likely to be the only mechanism of protection.
next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
transferrin iron starvation therapy for lethal bacterial and fungal infections.
new strategies to treat antibiotic-resistant infections are urgently needed. we serendipitously discovered that stem cell conditioned media possessed broad antimicrobial properties. biochemical, functional, and genetic assays confirmed that the antimicrobial effect was mediated by supra-physiological concentrations of transferrin. human transferrin inhibited growth of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii), and fungal (candida albicans) pathogens by sequestering iron and disrupting membrane potential. serial passage in subtherapeutic transferrin concentrations resulted in no emergence of resistance. infected mice treated with intravenous human transferrin had improved survival and reduced microbial burden. finally, adjunctive transferrin reduced the emergence of rifampin-resistant mutants of s. aureus in infected mice treated with rifampin. transferrin is a promising, novel antimicrobial agent that merits clinical investigation. these results provide proof of principle that bacterial infections can be treated in vivo by attacking host targets (ie, trace metal availability) rather than microbial targets.
antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of dispersinb(r)-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.
could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates collected from the middle east and africa between 2004 and 2011.
the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. in this study, susceptibility among gram-positive and gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the middle east and africa was examined. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution methods. us food and drug administration (fda)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. in total, 2967 gram-positive and 6322 gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. all staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. all enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of escherichia coli and 32.9% of klebsiella pneumoniae. more than 95% of e. coli and enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. the most active agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the mic90 (mic required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against a. baumannii was low at 2mg/l. tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most gram-negative pathogens. tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most gram-positive pathogens from the middle east and africa.
antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
[adherence to copper and stainless steel metal coupons of common nosocomial bacterial strains].
background: copper has a bactericidal activity against a series of bacterial strains. aim: to measure resistance to bacterial adherence of copper (cu) and stainless steel (ss) metal coupons. material and methods: bacterial strains causing nosocomial infections in chile were analyzed. bacterial adherence was studied using a previously described method based on a system of metal coupons that are immersed in culture media containing the bacteria of interest at room temperature. results: adherence to cu and ss coupons was different for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii strains. for these strains, no adherence to cu coupons occurred during the 48 h observation period compared to a rapidly increasing adherence to ss coupons, with a final colony count of 1.00 e + 07 cfu/ml. for two different pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains, inhibition of adherence was not observed on cu coupons, and colony counts were similar for cu and ss using the standard inoculum (2-3 x lo7 cfu).a partial decrease in adherence was observed for cu but not for ss coupons, when a lower inoculum was used. conclusions: copper surfaces represent an interesting option to reduce bacterial contamination in the hospital environment due to its resistance to bacterial adhesion of most of the common nosocomial bacterial strains.
[distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing bloodstream infections in patients in intensive care unit].
objective: to investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria  causing bloodstream infections in intensive care unit (icu) patients and to provide a basis for rational clinical use of antibiotics. methods: the data of positive specimens, including whole blood, catheter blood and bone marrow samples, were isolated from icu patients from january 2010 to december 2012. disc diffusion method, micro-dilution and etest method were used to test drug sensitivity. distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria were analyzed retrospectively. results: a total of 1077 strains were isolated from 903 patients with bloodstream infection during 3 years. gram-positive (g(+)) bacteria and gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria accounted for 59.33% (639 isolates) and 40.67% (438 isolates) respectively. the 5 most frequently isolated bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis (20.06%, 216 isolates) followed in order by escherichia coli (13.93%, 150 isolates), acinetobacter baumannii (10.03%, 108 isolates), klebsiella pneumonia (7.80%, 84 isolates) and staphylococcus aureus (6.96%, 75 isolates). there was no significant difference in distribution of bacteria during 3 years. the resistance rate of staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than that of staphylococcus aureus to most of the tested drugs. the resistance rate of staphylococcus epidermidis to quinoline/dalfopristin (4.2%) and nitrofurazone (15.3%) was relatively low, while resistance to penicillin (94.4%), linezolid (93.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (90.3%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (87.5%) and oxacillin (83.3%) was over 80%. the resistance rate of staphylococcus aureus to penicillin (96.0%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (84.0%), linezolid (76.0%) and oxacillin (76.0%) was over 70%, and resistance to the other common antibacterial drugs was below 70%. the resistance rate of acinetobacter baumannii to amikacin (38.9%), nitrofurazone (91.7%), cefotetan (88.9%), ceftazidime (88.9%), ampicillin (88.9%), ceftriaxone (86.1%), the cefepime (86.1%), aztreonam (80.6%) and cefazolin (80.6%), and overall above 80%. the resistance rate of escherichia coli to amikacin (30.0%), cefotetan (24.0%) and imipenem (16.0%) was below 30%, while resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (94.0%), levofloxacin (84.0%), ampicillin (84.0%) and ceftriaxone (80.0%) was over 80%. conclusions: among the bacteria causing bloodstream infection as isolated from icu patients, g(+) and g(-) bacteria accounted for 59.33% and 40.67%, respectively. the resistance rate of g(-) was higher than that of g(+), and resistance rate of majority of bacteria was higher than 60% on average. before obtaining the susceptibility test results, both g(-) and g(+) should be taken into account on choosing antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of icu patients.
antimicrobial use, incidence, etiology and resistance patterns in bacteria causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in a clinical-surgical intensive care unit.
introduction: antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat in hospitalized patients, and inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is known to adversely affect outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). the aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial usage, incidence, etiology, and antimicrobial resistance trends for prominent nosocomial pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in a clinical-surgical intensive care unit (icu). methods: gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus causing vap, as well as their antimicrobial resistance patterns and data on consumption (defined daily dose [ddd] per 1,000 patient days) of glycopeptides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenems in the unit were evaluated in two different periods (a and b). results: antimicrobial use was high, mainly of broad-spectrum cephalosporins, with a significant increase in the consumption of glycopeptides (p < 0.0001) and carbapenems (p < 0.007) in period b. for acinetobacter baumannii and members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 5.27- and 3.06-fold increases in vaps, respectively, were noted, and a significant increase in resistance rates was found for imipenem-resistant a. baumannii (p = 0.003) and third-generation cephalosporins-resistant enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.01) isolates in this same period. conclusions: our results suggest that there is a link between antibiotics usage at institutional levels and resistant bacteria. the use of carbapenems was related to the high rate of resistance in a. baumannii and therefore a high consumption of imipenem/meropenem could play a major role in selective pressure exerted by antibiotics in a. baumannii strains.
comparison of the bacterial etiology of early-onset and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia in subjects enrolled in 2 large clinical studies.
background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is classified as early-onset or late-onset, in part, to identify subjects at risk for infection with resistant pathogens. we assessed differences in the bacterial etiology of early-onset versus late-onset vap. methods: subjects enrolled in 2004-2006 in 2 clinical studies of doripenem versus imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, with a diagnosis of vap (n = 500) were included in the analysis. subjects were classified by ventilator status: early-onset vap (< 5 d of ventilation) or late-onset vap (>/= 5 d of ventilation). baseline demographics and bacterial etiology were analyzed by vap status. results: late-onset vap subjects had higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache ii) scores (mean 16.6 versus 15.5, p = .008). there were no significant differences in clinical pulmonary infection score, sex, age, or presence of bacteremia between the groups. a total of 496 subjects had a baseline pathogen, and 50% of subjects in each group had >/= 2 pathogens. with the exception of staphylococcus aureus, which was common in early-onset vap, the pathogens (including potentially multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens) isolated from early-onset versus late-onset vap were not significantly different between groups. acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa with decreased susceptibility to any study drug was observed in early-onset and late-onset vap subjects. conclusions: there were no significant differences in the prevalence of potential mdr pathogens associated with early-onset or late-onset vap, even in subjects with prior antibiotics. empiric therapy for early-onset vap should also include agents likely to be effective for potential mdr pathogens. further prospective studies should evaluate microbiology trends in subjects with vap.
comparing the transmission potential of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii among inpatients using target environmental monitoring.
background: with the increasing isolation rate of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab) in china hospitals, more researches focused on its antimicrobial resistance, but few studies reported its nosocomial transmission. in this study, we aim to investigate the transmission features of mdr-ab among inpatients using target environmental monitoring. methods: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and mdr-ab active screening and target environmental screening were performed from march 2010 to october 2011 in respiratory intensive care unit (ricu). we compared bed linen contamination rate and acquisition rate of mdr-ab with those of mrsa and analyzed the correlation between weekly colonization pressure adjusted by degree of bed linen contamination (wcpe) and weekly acquisition rate (war) of mdr-ab. results: we found that both the bed linen contamination rate and the acquisition rate of mdr-ab were higher than those of mrsa (chi(2) = 98.081, p < .01; chi(2) = 49.844, p < .01, respectively). the correlation analysis showed positive correlation between mdr-ab wcpe and war (rs = 0.560, p < .01). the wcpe and war of mdr-ab were higher than those of mrsa (z = -5.439, p < .01; z = -3.258, p < .01, respectively). conclusion: compared with mrsa, mdr-ab carriers showed stronger ability to contaminate their immediate environment, and mdr-ab was easier to transmit among inpatients. therefore, it was likely more important to perform active environmental monitoring as a method of transmission evaluation and a measure of routine infection control to prevent and control mdr-ab nosocomial transmission more effectively.
esculentin-2cha: a host-defense peptide with differential cytotoxicity against bacteria, erythrocytes and tumor cells.
the host-defense peptide, esculentin-2cha (gfssifrgva(10)kfaskglgk d(20)laklgvdlva(30) ckiskqc) shows potent (mic</=6 mum) growth inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia and differential cytotoxic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50)=150 mum) and human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells (lc(50)=10 mum). esculentin-2cha significantly (p<0.01) stimulates the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 by mouse lymphoid cells and elevates its production after stimulation with concanavalin a and significantly (p<0.05) stimulates tnf-alpha production by peritoneal macrophages. effects on il-6 and il-1beta production were not significant. removal of the hydrophobic n-terminal hexapeptide (gfssif) from esculentin-2cha results in abolition of growth inhibitory activity against s. aureus and cytotoxic activity against erythrocytes and a549 cells as well as a marked (>/=16-fold) reduction in potency against a. baumannii and s. maltophilia. the primary structure of esculentin-2 has been poorly conserved between frog species but evolutionary pressure has acted to maintain the hydrophobic character of this n-terminal hexapeptide sequence. removal of the cyclic c-terminal domain (ckiskqc) and replacement of the cys(31) and cys(37) residues by serine resulted in appreciable decreases in cytotoxicity against all microorganisms and against mammalian cells. the more cationic [d20k, d27k] analog showed a modest increase in potency against all microorganisms (up to 4-fold) but a marked increase in cytotoxicity against erythrocytes (lc(50)=11 mum) and a549 cells (lc(50)=3 mum).
design and synthesis of 2-aminothiazole based antimicrobials targeting mrsa.
privileged structure-based libraries have been shown to provide high affinity lead compounds for a variety of important biological targets. the present study describes the synthesis and screening of a 2-aminothiazole based compound library to determine their utility as antimicrobials, focusing on mrsa. several of the compounds in this series demonstrated improved antimicrobial activity as compared to ceftriaxone (ctx), a beta-lactam antibiotic. the most potent compound (21) had mics in the range of 2-4 mug/ml across a panel of staphylococcus aureus strains. in addition, trifluoromethoxy substituted aminothiazoles and aminobenzothiazoles were found to be potent antimicrobials with mics of 2-16 mug/ml.
synergistic combination dry powders for inhaled antimicrobial therapy: formulation, characterization and in vitro evaluation.
in combination antimicrobial therapy, the desired outcome is to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum and to achieve a possible synergistic effect. however, adverse antagonistic species may also emerge from such combinations, leading to treatment failure with serious consequences. it is therefore imperative to screen the drug candidates for compatibility and possible antagonistic interactions. the aim of this work was to develop a novel synergistic dry powder inhaler (dpi) formulation for antimicrobial combination therapy via the pulmonary route. binary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and gatifloxacin hydrochloride, sd-cip/gat) and ternary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, gatifloxacin hydrochloride, and lysozyme, sd-cip/gat/lys) combinations were prepared via spray-drying on a buchi(r) nano spray dryer b-90. the powder morphologies were spherical with a slightly corrugated surface and all within the respirable size range. the powders yielded fine particle fractions (of the loaded dose) of over 40% when dispersed using an aerolizer(r) at 60 l/min. time-kill studies carried out against the respiratory tract infection-causing bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumonia, and acinetobacter baumannii at 1 x the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) over 24h revealed no antagonistic behavior for both the binary and ternary combinations. while the interactions were generally found to be indifferent, a favorable synergistic effect was detected in the dual combination (sd-cip/gat) when it was tested against p. aeruginosa bacteria.
in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual agents of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
objectives: catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis) are common healthcare-associated infections associated with increased morbidity and medical costs. antiseptic- and antibiotic-coated central venous catheters (cvcs) have been proposed to reduce the incidence of crbsis, with variable success. the aim of this study was to determine the in vivo antibiofilm activity of biocompatible and inexpensive compounds, such as cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin, against usual agents of crbsis. methods: the antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin was tested against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans in a mouse foreign body infection model, using polyurethane catheter segments. biofilm formation was assessed with a crystal violet assay to quantify the total biomass, with a tetrazolium reduction assay to quantify the metabolic activity and with scanning electron microscopy. results: at subinhibitory concentrations, cerium nitrate significantly reduced biofilm formation by c. albicans, chitosan significantly decreased biofilm formation by s. epidermidis and c. albicans, and hamamelitannin significantly inhibited all bacterial biofilms. discussion: the in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate against c. albicans and of chitosan against c. albicans and s. epidermidis, at subinhibitory concentrations, makes them promising alternatives to coat cvcs. moreover, the microbicidal effect on a wider range of cvc colonizers was previously reported in vitro for both compounds, at higher concentrations. for all bacterial strains, the highest in vivo antibiofilm efficacy was achieved with hamamelitannin. for a. baumannii, this is the first report of in vivo inhibition.
monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
the drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in korea. therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in korea. a total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 escherichia coli, 60 staphylococcus aureus, 15 staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 enterococcus faecalis, 27 citrobacter freundii, 35 acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of icr mice and sd rats. of these species, acinetobacter baumannii and enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) in e-test. in case of acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed mic values 16-128 microg/ml for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/ml) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. in addition, 44.1% of the enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/ml range, while mic value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/ml. these results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
a comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed uv radiation device.
daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. however, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. this study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (uv) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous uv-c, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, amikacin and ciprofloxacin-resistant a. baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed uv or continuous uv-c. pulsed uv and continuous uv-c required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2log growth inhibition of all the species. the use of pulsed uv in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. the new portable pulsed uv radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
[development status of new antibacterials].
the increase of the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem worldwide. as for gram-positive bacteria, the community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant strains have been increasing. as for gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii have been increasing due to the carbapenemase production recently. during these 10 years, various types of novel antibacterials targeted for gram-positive bacteria have been approved in us and eu, but not in japan. on the other hand, the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for gram-negative bacteria is still immature. in this review, the status of the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for these multi-drug-resistant bacteria will be reviewed.
trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 1,141), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in taiwan. mics of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast-2011). among drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, all of the prsp isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (mic(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one mrsa isolate (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three vre isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. among the gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for esbl-producing e. coli (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae (mic(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by fda criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by eucast-2011 criteria. the susceptibility rate for a. baumannii (mic(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. a bimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible a. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible a. baumannii isolates. in taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of a. baumannii.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
antimicrobial acrylic materials with in situ generated silver nanoparticles.
polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) is widely used to treat traumatic head injuries (cranioplasty) and orthopedic injuries (bone cement), but there is a problem with implant-centered infections. with organisms such as acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus developing resistance to antibiotics, there is a need for novel antimicrobial delivery mechanisms without risk of developing resistant organisms. objectives: to develop a novel antimicrobial implant material by generating silver nanoparticles (agnp) in situ in pmma. results: all pmma samples with agnp's (agnp-pmma) released ag(+) ions in vitro for over 28 days. in vitro antimicrobial assays revealed that these samples (even samples with the slowest release rate) inhibited 99.9% of bacteria against four different strains of bacteria. long-term antimicrobial assay showed a continued antibacterial effect past 28 days. some agnp-loaded pmma groups had comparable durometer-d hardness (a measure of degree of cure) and modulus to control pmma, but all experimental groups had slightly lower ultimate transverse strengths. conclusions: agnp-pmma demonstrated a tremendously broad-spectrum and long-intermediate-term antimicrobial effect with comparable mechanical properties to control pmma. current efforts are focused on further improving mechanical properties by reducing agnp loading and assessing fatigue properties.

antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.
evaluation of 4,5-disubstituted-2-aminoimidazole-triazole conjugates for antibiofilm/antibiotic resensitization activity against mrsa and acinetobacter baumannii.
a library of 4,5-disubstituted-2-aminoimidazole-triazole conjugates (2-aits) was  synthesized, and the antibiofilm activity was investigated. this class of small molecules was found to inhibit biofilm formation by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) at low-micromolar concentrations; 4,5-disubstituted-2-aits were also able to inhibit and disperse acinetobacter baumannii biofilms. the activities of the lead compounds were compared against the naturally occurring biofilm dispersant cis-2-decenoic acid and were revealed to be more potent. the ability of selected compounds to resensitize mrsa to traditional antibiotics (resensitization activity) was also determined. lead compounds were observed to resensitize mrsa to oxacillin by 2-4-fold.
prolonged triple therapy for persistent multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis.
purpose: a case of persistent multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis successfully treated with a prolonged and novel combination of antimicrobials is reported. summary: a 38-year-old, 84-kg caucasian woman with a recent history of craniotomy was admitted with nausea, fever, headache, photophobia, and drainage from her craniotomy incision. she underwent a repeat craniotomy on hospital day 4 with abscess debridement and repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. cultures grew mdr a. baumannii, coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. based on the limited published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for colistin, we determined a favorable outcome with i.v. colistin monotherapy was unlikely and decided to treat the patient with simultaneous i.v. and intraventricular colistin, as well as intraventricular tobramycin and i.v. rifampin. she was treated with a total of 36 days of intraventricular colistin, 40 days of intraventricular tobramycin, 51 days of i.v. colistin and rifampin, and 56 days i.v. vancomycin for infection that persisted despite multiple debridements. the patient had subsequent improvement in clinical manifestations and eradication of infection. she was subsequently discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on hospital day 77 with posttreatment sequelae including mental impairment and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. follow-up visits revealed significant improvement in her mental status, speech, and strength on the side not affected by the stroke. conclusion: prolonged combination therapy with intraventricular colistin and tobramycin plus i.v. colistin, rifampin, and vancomycin led to the resolution of a persistent central nervous system infection caused by mdr a. baumannii.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
changing pattern of antibiotic susceptibility in intensive care units: ten years  experience of a university hospital.
the study was performed to assess microorganisms and antibiotic susceptibility patterns during ten years in intensive care units of a university hospital. infection control committee has active, prospective surveillance in icus for thirteen years. ten years data of icus was evaluated retrospectively from surveillance forms. microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance were recorded according to the years. during ten years, gram negative microorganisms were the most frequent isolated microorganisms from clinical specimens. acinetobacter baumannii (21.8%), pseudomonas aerigunosa (16%), escherichia coli (10.4%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (8%) were the most common gram negative microorganisms. however, staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent gram positive microorganism, the incidence decreased from 18.6% to 4.8% during ten years. also antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms changed during ten years. carbapenem resistance increased from 44% to 92% in a. baumannii and ciprofloxacin resistance increased in e. coli from 28% to 60% and in k. pneumoniae from 21% to 55% during ten years. however, methicilin resistance decreased in s. aureus from 96% to 54%. in conclusion, antibiotic resistance is growing problem in icus. rationale antibiotic policies and infection control measures will prevent the development of resistance.
microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
background: with the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. we aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. methods: between july 2008 and august 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a taiwan medical center were enrolled. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with vitek-2 system and was analyzed according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. we followed usa food and drug administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. results: the median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. after tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. a baumannii and p aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. the tigecycline susceptibility rate of a baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. conclusion: the most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were a baumannii and p aeruginosa. tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of a baumannii, methicillin-resistant s aureus, e coli, and k pneumoniae. exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of a baumannii for tigecycline.
synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.
synthesis and biological activity of 2-aminoimidazole triazoles accessed by suzuki-miyaura cross-coupling.
a pilot library of 2-aminoimidazole triazoles (2-aits) was synthesized and assayed against acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococus aureus (mrsa). results from these studies show that these new derivatives have improved biofilm dispersal activities as well as antibacterial properties against a. baumannii. with mrsa biofilms they are found to possess biofilm inhibition capabilities at low micromolar concentrations.
cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
objective: some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. materials and methods: antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against dna virus herpes simplex type 1 and rna virus parainfluenza (type-3). cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: candida albicans and candida parapsilosis. results: atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. conclusion: antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
antibacterial activity of acinetobacter baumannii phage varphiab2 endolysin (lysab2) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
to investigate the nature and origin of the antibacterial activity of the lytic phage varphiab2 toward acinetobacter baumannii, we successfully isolated and characterized a novel phage lysozyme (endolysin) from varphiab2 and named it lysab2. to analyze antibacterial activity of lysab2, the complete lysab2 and two deletion derivatives were constructed, purified and characterized. zymographic assays showed that only the intact lysab2 could lyse the peptidoglycan of a. baumannii and the staphylococcus aureus cell wall. antibacterial analysis also showed that only the intact lysab2 retained the complete bactericidal activity. when applied exogenously, lysab2 exhibited a broad bacteriolytic activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. thermostability assays indicated that lysab2 was stable at 20 approximately 40 degrees c. its optimal ph was 6.0, and it was active from ph 4 to 8. scanning electron microscopy revealed that exposure to 500 mugml(-1) lysab2 for up to 60 min caused a remarkable modification of the cell shape of the bacteria. treating bacteria with lysab2 clearly enhanced permeation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. these results indicate that lysab2 is an effective lysozyme against bacteria, and they suggest that it is a good candidate for a therapeutic/disinfectant agent to control nosocomial infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria.
identification of streptomyces sp. kh29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.
changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections in 11 teaching hospitals in taiwan between 1993 and 2006.
background/purpose: healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice. understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our infection control methods and therapy goals. to understand the changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsi) in taiwan, we retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial bsi. methods: eleven major teaching hospitals in taiwan were invited to participate in the study. the overall density of nosocomial infections and major bsi-causing organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida species, were collected. the distribution of the different candida species was also recorded. background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. results: the incidence of nosocomial bsi ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43% of all nosocomial infections. the most common causative organism of nosocomial bacteremia was s. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. overall, the incidence of s. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). the rate of candida fungemia (p < 0.01) and a. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased significantly. c. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia, ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis and candida glabrata. however, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. conclusion: the overall incidence rate of s. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not statistically significant. however, the rate of candida fungemia and a. baumannii bacteremia had increased significantly.
progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
diacyl glycerol arginine-based surfactants: biological and physicochemical properties of catanionic formulations.
in this paper, we report on a catanionic vesicles-based strategy to reduce the cytotoxicity of the diacyl glycerol arginine-based synthetic surfactants 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-o-(n(alpha)-acetyl-l-arginine) hydrochloride (1414rac) and 1,2-dilauroyl-rac-glycero-3-o-(n(alpha)-acetyl-l-arginine) hydrochloride (1212rac). the behavior of these surfactants was studied either as pure components or after their formulation as pseudo-tetra-chain catanionic mixtures with phosphatidylglycerol (pg) and as cationic mixtures with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (dppc) used as control. the antimicrobial activity of the negatively charged formulations against acinetobacter baumannii was maintained with respect to the surfactant alone, while a significant improvement of the antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus was observed, together with a strong decrease of hemolytic activity. the influence of the net charge of the catanionic vesicles on membrane selectivity was studied using model membranes. the dynamics of surface tension changes induced by the addition of 1414rac/pg aqueous dispersions into phospholipid monolayers composed of zwitterionic dppc as model system for mammalian membranes and of negatively charged pg mimicking cytoplasmic membrane of gram-positive bacteria was followed by tensiometry. our results constitute a proof of principle that tuning formulation can reduce the cytotoxicity of many surfactants, opening their possible biological applications.
rifampin resistance in carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii in siriraj hospital, thailand.
there is a growing evidence on emergence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab) in thailand and recent treatment guidelines recommend a combination therapy using carbapenem and/or polymyxin with rifampin. rifampin would be added in a combination therapy. the susceptibility of this pathogen to rifampin is not known, so we studied the rifampin susceptibility and possible mechanisms of resistance used by crab. the disk diffusion test was performed on 111 clinical isolates using 5 microg rifampin disk following clsi guidelines. the inhibition zone was interpreted based upon the recommendation for staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zone < 20 mm = resistant). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the primers specific for arr-2 encoding rifampin adp-ribosyltransferase was performed in all isolates. the rpob dna sequences from two isolates, with or without arr-2, were compared. all isolates under study were rifampin resistant. inhibition zone was < 14 mm for all isolates. the arr-2 was positive for 35 isolates (31.5%) and these isolates correlated with high level of resistance (inhibition zone < 10mm). the dna sequences of rpob genes in arr-2 negative isolate showed mutations l904s, p906r, k909n and m1262k that might have roles in rifampin resistance. mutations of rpob genes in some isolates and possession of arr-2 in class 1 integron element were mechanisms for rifampin resistance and these resistant determinants can disseminate through both vertical and horizontal gene transfer. under this circumstance, it is not recommended to use rifampin in the treatment of carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii in thailand.
a study of cytotoxicity of novel chlorokojic acid derivatives with their antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
a series of 6-chloromethyl-3-hydroxy-2-substituted 4h-pyran-4-one derivatives were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial and antiviral activities. mannich base derivatives were prepared through the reaction of substituted piperazine or piperidine derivatives on chlorokojic acid and formaline. the structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by ir, (1)h and (13)c nmr, esi-ms, and elemental analysis. according to the activity studies, compounds 2-7 (mic: 1-2 microg/ml) were found to be highly active against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, while compounds 3, 5 and 6 showed significant activity against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. also, compounds 2-7 were more remarkably active against candida albicans and candida parapsilosis (mic: 4-8 microg/ml). additionally, compound 2 was the most active one against rna virus pi-3.
dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli in german intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82 for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.
the global problem of antibiotic resistance.
amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. however, an equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. several new agents that are best suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the meca gene. however, the dramatic spread in the us of the now common community strain of staphylococcus aureus usa300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against mrsa to the community. as the pharmaceutical industry focused on discovering new agents for use against mrsa, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. such mdr isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. these determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug target in the cell. the continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.
infectious complications in oif/oef veterans with traumatic brain injury.
of veterans from the u.s. global war on terrorism who have sought care in the department of veterans affairs, approximately 12% have an infectious disease diagnosis. infections in those veterans with traumatic brain injury (tbi) include infections associated with blast injuries and burns, such as skin and soft tissue infections; infections as a result of retained bullet or shrapnel fragments; pulmonary infections resulting from lung injury, intubation, or resultant tracheostomy; hospital-acquired infections, such as those associated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and other antimicrobial resistant organisms such as acinetobacter baumannii; and infections from implanted prosthetic devices, such as metal hardware or skull flaps. longer-term cognitive impairment may result in behaviors that place veterans with tbi at risk for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis c virus infections. finally, chronic infections acquired abroad, such as cutaneous leishmaniasis or q-fever, may be diagnosed after veterans return to the united states. these infections present challenges in terms of added morbidity and costs associated with complex antimicrobial management; isolation requirements; and surgical procedures, such as those to remove infected retained fragments or prosthetic devices. in this review, providers will become more familiar with the scope and complexity of infectious disease management in veterans with tbi.
antimicrobial properties of brevinin-2-related peptide and its analogs: efficacy  against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
brevinin-2 related peptide (b2rp; giwdtiksmg(10)kvfagkilqn(20)l.nh(2)), first isolated from skin secretions of the mink frog lithobates septentrionalis, shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its therapeutic potential is limited by moderate hemolytic activity. the peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation in a membrane-mimetic solvent but amphipathicity is low. increasing amphipathicity together with hydrophobicity by the substitutions lys(16)-->leu and lys(16)-->ala increased hemolytic activity approximately fivefold without increasing antimicrobial potency. the substitution leu(18)-->lys increased both cationicity and amphipathicity but produced decreases in both antimicrobial potency and hemolytic activity. in contrast, increasing cationicity of b2rp without changing amphipathicity by the substitution asp(4)-->lys resulted in a fourfold increase in potency against escherichia coli [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) = 6 microm) and twofold increases in potency against staphylococcus aureus (mic = 12.5 microm) and candida albicans (mic = 6 microm) without changing significantly hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50) = 95 microm). the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the gram-negative bacterium acinetobacter baumannii constitutes a serious risk to public health. b2rp (mic = 3-6 microm) and [lys(4)]b2rp (mic = 1.5-3 microm) potently inhibited the growth of nosocomial isolates of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. although the analogs [lys(4), lys(18)]b2rp and [lys(4), ala(16), lys(18)]b2rp showed reduced potency against staphylococcus aureus, they retained activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic = 3-6 microm) and had very low hemolytic activity (lc(50) > 200 microm).
non-adherence to guidelines: an avoidable cause of failure of empirical antimicrobial therapy in the presence of difficult-to-treat bacteria.
purpose: to identify the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to difficult-to-treat (dtt) bacteria (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), and to assess the rate and the causes of inappropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy. methods: in an intensive care unit of a university hospital, patients with vap were empirically treated with antibiotics without activity against dtt bacteria if the patients had no prior hospitalization or prior administration of antibiotics, according to local guidelines. results: overall, the empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 190 (87%) out of 218 patients with vap. fifty (23%) patients developed problems due to dtt bacteria. the risk factors for vap due to dtt bacteria were shock state, prior antimicrobial therapy, prior stay in long-term care facilities and late-onset vap. empirical antimicrobial therapy was inappropriate in 20 (40%) patients with vap due to dtt bacteria and 8 (5%) patients with vap due to non-dtt (p = 0.001). guidelines violations (nine patients), bacteria not included in antibiotic spectrum (eight patients) and bacterial resistance (three patients) were the causes of inappropriateness in case of dtt bacteria. conclusion: despite the abundant information for the treatment of vap and the establishment of guidelines, too many patients with dtt bacteria received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. since 45% of the cases are related to non-adherence to the local protocol, there is room for improvement by implementing educational programs. also, since dtt bacteria are found in 23% of late-onset vap, empirical antibiotic treatment should be directed against these pathogens.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of mexico.
traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. in this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast mexico. the dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. the extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three gram-negative bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii), three gram-positive bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis and two staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and c. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a dpph free radical assay. no activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). we report here for the first time activity of ceanothus coeruleus against s. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 125 mug ml(-1)), c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and c. parapsilosis (mics between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); chrysanctinia mexicana against c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)); colubrina greggii against e. faecalis (mics 250 mug ml(-1)) and cordia boissieri against c. glabrata (mic 125 mug ml(-1)). furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from ceanothus coeruleus, chrysanctinia mexicana, colubrina greggii and cyperus alternifolius. some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species ceanothus coeruleus, schinus molle, colubrina greggii and cordia boissieri.
minocycline--an old drug for a new century: emphasis on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii.
the epidemiology of nosocomial and community-acquired infections has changed in recent years. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), especially community-associated mrsa (ca-mrsa), has emerged as a gram-positive organism with an increasing impact in clinical practice. infections with acinetobacter baumannii have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. minocycline has significant in vitro activity against mrsa and a. baumannii that is comparable with agents currently used against these organisms. the absence of an intravenous (i.v.) minocycline formulation in recent years has limited its use in seriously ill patients infected with these organisms. however, minocycline i.v. has recently been reintroduced to the us market. the objective of this study was to review available information on the chemistry, mechanism of action, in vitro activity, resistance mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy of minocycline against mrsa and a. baumannii. this article provides suggestions for future studies and potential uses of minocycline and is designed to trigger interest in systematic clinical evaluation of minocycline for patients infected with these organisms. in conclusion, minocycline is an old drug that has the potential to become an important part of the armamentarium against emerging infections such as ca-mrsa and a. baumannii. owing to its promising profile against these clinically important pathogens as well as excellent pharmacokinetic properties, minocycline merits evaluation in serious infections.
tigecycline.
infection with resistant pathogens can adversely affect clinical, microbiological and economic outcomes. new agents for the treatment of many such serious infections are acutely needed in hospital practice. tigecycline is a novel glycylcycline antimicrobial for intravenous use. it has an expanded broad-spectrum antibacterial activity including multi-drug resistant pathogens, like methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant enterococci , multi-drug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae , extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria and acinetobacter baumannii . tigecycline however is not active against proteus, providencia and pseudomonas species. its currently approved indications include complicated skin and skin structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. it has also been found to be effective for the treatment of community- as well as hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia, sepsis with shock and urinary tract infections. tigecycline appears to be a valuable treatment option for the management of superbugs, especially where conventional therapy has failed.
[investigation of the effect of efflux pump inhibitors to mic values of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus].
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of efflux pump inhibitors on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of ciprofloxacin (cip) in fluoroquinolone-resistant 42 pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 42), escherichia coil (n= 97), acinetobacter baumannii (n= 58) and staphylococcus aureus (n= 80) strains isolated from clinical specimens. for this purpose phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (pa beta n) was used for p. aeruginosa, e. coli, a. baumannii and reserpine for s. aureus isolates as pump inhibitors. fluoroquinolone resistance of the clinical isolates were determined by vitek2 compact (biomerieux, france) automated system and confirmed with standard broth microdilution method. for the investigation of the effects of inhibitor agents, the mic values were also determined in the presence of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml pa beta n and 20 microg/ml reserpine. in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, 61.9% of cip resistant p. aeruginosa strains converted to susceptible ones, while this rate was 73.8% in the presence of 100 mg/l pa beta n. in a. baumannii clinical isolates, 8.6% and 15.5% of cip-resistant strains have become susceptible in the presence of 25 mg/l and 100 mg/l pa beta n, respectively. similarly the mic values for cip have decreased > or = 4 folds in 42.2%, and > or = 2 folds in 30.9% of e. coli isolates, in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, however, there was no change in mics of 26.9% of e. coli strains. the mic values have also been lowered for > or = 4 folds in 83.6%, and two folds in 13.4% of e. coli strains by the use of 100 mg/l pa beta n concentration, however, no decrease in mic values was detected in 3% of the isolates. 20 mg/l of reserpine have caused a decrease of > or = 4 folds in 8.75%, and two folds in 33.75% of s. aureus isolates, while there was no change in mic values of 57.5% of s. aureus strains. our results showed that pa beta n causes significant reduction in mic values for cip in the clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, e. coli and a. baumannii and this effect may be attributed to efflux pump inhibition. in contrast, it was concluded that reserpine does not have a considerable effect on the mic values of s. aureus against ciprofloxacin.
update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the united states: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) 2005 to 2007.
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (ttest) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. objective: the aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the united states in 2005, 2006, and 2007. methods: isolates were collected from 172 centers across the united states.in vitro activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines and clsi or us food and drug administration interpretive criteria. results: overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. for the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. one exception was acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for esbl-pproducing escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/l against non-esbl-producing k pneumoniae, k oxytoca, e coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and a baumannii. against methicillin susceptible and -resistant s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline mic(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/l. conclusions: this report of 3 years of data from the test study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for a baumannii. tigecycline continued to have good activity against enterobacteriaceae, a baumannii, s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and s agalactiae.
control of bacterial biofilms with marine alkaloid derivatives.
bacterial biofilms are defined as a community of surface-attached bacteria that are protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules. we have recently reported the synthesis of a small molecule, denoted tage, based on the natural product bromoageliferin and demonstrated that tage has anti-biofilm activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. herein we demonstrate that tage: (1) does not have selective toxicity against cells within the biofilm state, (2) will inhibit biofilm development under flow conditions, indicating that the cv staining protocol correlates with the ability to be active under biomimetic conditions, and (3) will disperse preformed p. aeruginosa biofilms. we also present preliminary toxicity work that indicates that tage is devoid of cytotoxicity in rat and mice cell lines. advanced derivatives of tage have generated compounds shown to be exceedingly effective as biofilm inhibitors against the gamma-proteobacteria in this study (p. aeruginosa strains pao1, pa14, pdo300, and acinetobacter baumannii). tage derivatives also possessed anti-biofilm activity against the beta-proteobacterium bordetella bronchiseptica (rb50) and the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus;tage derivatives inhibited the formation of biofilms, however, some of this activity is attributed to microbicidal activity. the tage derivatives presented in this study, however, do not disperse pre-formed biofilms with the same efficiency as tage.
melatonin as an antibiotic: new insights into the actions of this ubiquitous molecule.
the incidence of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been increasing rapidly worldwide despite advances in antibacterial therapy in the last two decades. among multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are of great importance, because they have emerged as primary nosocomial pathogens in hospital outbreaks. in this study, we investigated whether melatonin has antibacterial effects against these microorganisms in vitro. the minimum inhibitory concentration of melatonin was determined using a standard microdilution method at 24 and 48 hr. melatonin inhibited microbial growth at both 24 and 48 hr; but results showed that melatonin had antibacterial effects against these microorganisms after 48 hr of incubation in lower doses [concentrations between 31.25 to 125 microg/ml (0.13-0.53 mm)]. also, it was determined that melatonin has a more potent antimicrobial effect on gram-negative microorganism. among possible mechanisms, it is concluded that melatonin showed antibacterial effects by reducing intracellular substrates.
[microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
evaluation of the inhibitory effects of human serum components on bactericidal activity of human beta defensin 3.
naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides (caps) are an essential component of the innate immune system of multicellular organisms. at concentrations generally higher than those found in vivo, most caps exhibit strong antibacterial properties in vitro, but their activity may be inhibited by body fluids, a fact that could limit their future use as antimicrobial and/or immunomodulatory agents. in the present study, we evaluated the effects of human serum components on bactericidal activity of the human beta-defensin 3 (hbd-3), a cap considered particularly promising for future therapeutic employment. human serum diluted to 20% strongly inhibited the bactericidal activity of the peptide against both the gram-positive species staphylococcus aureus and the gram-negative species acinetobacter baumannii. such activity was not restored in serum devoid of salts (dialyzed), pre-treated with protease inhibitors, or subjected to both of these treatments. the addition of physiological concentrations of nacl, cacl2, and human albumin in the bactericidal assay abolished bactericidal activity of hbd-3 against s. aureus, while it only partially inhibited the activity of the peptide against a. baumannii. although a proteolytic activity of serum on hbd-3 was demonstrated at the protein level by western blot, addition of physiological concentrations of trypsin to the bactericidal assay only partially affected the antibacterial properties of the peptide. altogether, these results demonstrate a major role of mono-divalent cations and serum proteins on inhibition of hbd-3 antibacterial properties and indicate a relative lack in sensitivity of the bactericidal activity of this peptide to trypsin and trypsin-like proteases.
management of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multiresistant bacteria.
purpose of review: the inappropriate choice of antibiotics (in nearly one third of episodes) is the most important risk factor for death. traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for subsequent use. recent findings: as multidrug resistance increases in the intensive care unit in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, costs, mortality, and morbidity are rising. although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are frequently considered together, they have different virulence, risk factors and susceptibilities, requiring different antimicrobial choices. assessment of clinical resolution should be differentiated in the presence of acute lung injury. in the absence of biochemical markers, oxygenation and core temperature should guide therapeutic decisions. summary: as ventilator-associated pneumonia increases, empiric therapy should be based on local pathogen etiology and antibiotic resistant patterns. a new approach to consider is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results and clinical resolution. with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in empiric therapy tailored after reassessment of the patient, there is hope for reducing costs, length of stay and mortality whereas the emergence of resistance will be minimized.
antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
in the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. on the other hand, both dna virus herpes simplex (hsv) and rna virus parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines. according to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against s. aureus and e. faecalis with mic values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by e. coli (2 microg/ml), k. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), a. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and b. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited c. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. however, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards pi-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (cpe).
treatment options for multidrug-resistant bacteria.
as a consequence of antibiotic overuse and misuse, nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a physician's nightmare throughout the world. no newer antimicrobials active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, are available or under investigation. the only exceptions are linezolid, some newer glycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin) and daptomycin (a lipopeptide), which are active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains, as well as tigecycline, a potent in vitro glycylcycline against mrsa, vre, acinetobacter baumannii and entended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)+ enterobacteriaceae. colistin, an antibiotic of the 1950s has been rediscovered by intensive care unit physicians for use against esbl+ enterobacteriaceae, as well as against multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. although success rates with colistin range between 50 and 73%, almost all studies are retrospective. immunostimulation efforts against s. aureus are still under development. as antibiotic research and development stagnate, rational policies for prescribing existing antibiotics plus strict infection control are the current mainstay efforts for preventing and combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
comparison of antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro with  those of propofol and midazolam.
background and objectives: the aim of our study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro, and to compare these effects with those of midazolam and propofol on staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeroginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli ( e. coli esbl). methods: all hypnotic dilutions were exposed to micro-organisms for 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min at room temperature in vitro. the inoculums taken from diluted suspensions were re-inoculated on blood agar and incubated for 18-24 h at 35 degrees c after which a count of the colonies was compared. results: midazolam reduced the viable cells of s. aureus at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min, and also completely inhibited the growth of e. coli, p. aeroginosa, a. baumannii and e. coli esbl. dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro and propofol, however, did not inhibit any of the micro-organisms tested. conclusion: in vitro, midazolam had an antimicrobial effect on e. coli, p. aeroginosa, a. baumannii and e. coli esbl. like propofol and dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro had no antimicrobial effect on any of the micro-organisms tested.
antibacterial evaluation of a collection of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin derivatives against multiresistant bacteria.
the objective of this study was to analyse an array of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin derivatives in order to determine those with good activity against bacteria that already present fluoroquinolone resistance associated with mutations in the gyra and/or parc genes. four norfloxacin and 20 ciprofloxacin derivatives were synthesised and tested against quinolone-susceptible and -resistant escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and staphylococcus aureus strains using a microdilution test. among the derivatives, the 4-methyl-7-piperazine ciprofloxacin derivative showed a minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms that was 16- and 8-fold lower than ciprofloxacin for a. baumannii and s. maltophilia, respectively. when the methyl group at position 4 in the piperazine ring was substituted by ethyl, butyl or heptyl groups, activity against a. baumannii steadily decreased. the 7-(4-methyl)-piperazine ciprofloxacin derivative (ub-8902) showed very good activity against these multiresistant microorganisms including a. baumannii and s. maltophilia.
surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
evaluation of a clinical pathway for ventilator-associated pneumonia: changes in  bacterial flora and the adequacy of empiric antibiotics over a three-year period.
background: evaluation of causative pathogens is vital for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). based on previous data (ann surg 1998;227:743-755), empiric antibiotics for our vap clinical pathway were modified to target early and late occurring pathogens (ampicillin/sulbactam during the first week of hospitalization; cefepime plus vancomycin afterwards). the objectives of this study were to compare organisms causing vap over a three-year period to previous data, and to determine the adequacy of the empiric antibiotic regimens. methods: a total of 299 critically ill trauma patients with vap over a three-year period were studied retrospectively. the incidence of pathogens causing vap in the study period were compared to a previously published study of a two-year period in our intensive care unit (icu). sensitivities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were evaluated over the study period. the adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for each episode of vap was determined. therapy was considered to be adequate if one or more antibiotics had in vitro activity against the organism causing vap. results: statistically significant changes in pathogens included increased staphylococcus aureus (incidence 17% vs. 11%, p = 0.024) and decreased acinetobacter baumannii (11% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). susceptibility patterns were statistically unchanged except for increased resistance of p. aeruginosa to extended-spectrum penicillins (p = 0.016). empiric therapy was adequate in 76% of vap episodes. conclusions: the clinical pathway's empiric antibiotic regimen was associated with only modest changes in organisms causing vap and provided a high rate of adequate empiric coverage.
assessment of the antibacterial activity of tea tree oil using the european en 1276 and en 12054 standard suspension tests.
the activity of tea tree oil (tto) and tto-containing products was investigated according to the en 1276 and en 12054 european suspension methods. the activity of different concentrations of tto, a hygienic skin wash (hsw), an alcoholic hygienic skin wash (ahsw) and an alcoholic hand rub (ahr) was investigated. these formulations were assessed in perfect conditions with the en 12054 test, and in perfect conditions as well as in the presence of interfering substances with the en 1276 test, against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the latter test, the activity of the same formulations without tto was also assessed as a control. with the en 1276 test, the ahr achieved a >10(5)-fold reduction against all four test organisms within a 1-min contact time. the ahsw achieved a >or=10(5)-fold reduction against a. baumannii after a 1-min contact time and against s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa after a 5-min contact time. the efficacy of tto appeared to be dependent on the formulation and the concentration tested, the concentration of interfering substances and, lastly, the organism tested. nevertheless, 5% tto achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in p. aeruginosa cell numbers after a 5-min contact time in perfect conditions. tto (5%) in 0.001% tween 80 was significantly more active against e. coli and p. aeruginosa than against s. aureus and a. baumannii. with the en 12054 test, after a 1-min contact time, 5% tto in 0.001% tween 80 and the ahsw achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in e. coli and a. baumannii cell numbers, respectively, and the ahr achieved a >4 log10 reduction against all organisms tested. the formulations used in this study are now being tested using a novel ex vivo method as well as the in vivo european standard handwashing method en 1499.
comparison of trends of resistance rates over 3 years calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of a given species from a patient.
we compared trends of annual resistance rates calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii per patient over a 3-year period from 2001 through 2003. antimicrobial susceptibility results of inpatients were extracted from a computerized database. annual resistance rates of a species were calculated by two methods: (i) from results for all isolates, even those from patients with multiple isolates in a given year and (ii) from results for the first isolate from a patient in a given year, regardless of susceptibility profile or specimen type. rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) did not differ among all isolates (79.9, 78.8 and 79.6%; p = 0.86), but decreased for the first isolate per patient (70.2, 65.7, and 64.1%; p = 0.006) over time. annual duplication rates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) decreased (39.6, 37.6, and 31.7%; p = 0.01), but those of mrsa increased significantly (64.3, 67.8, and 68.9%; p = 0.004). rates of cefotaxime-resistant k. pneumoniae did not differ over time by either method, and rates of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii decreased over time by both methods. duplication rates did not differ for either susceptible or resistant isolates of k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the trends in mrsa rate differed by the two methods because of the different proportion of duplicate isolates per year. mrsa rates might be increasingly overestimated for all isolates. these results suggest that the method of calculating results for the first isolate per patient may remove the effect of duplication, allowing the simple and unambiguous analysis of cumulative susceptibility rates.
comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only 1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.
hospital-acquired infections following the 1999 marmara earthquake.
in this study, medical records of all casualties admitted to our hospital following the marmara earthquake, which struck northwest turkey and resulted in the destruction of several towns in the marmara region, were evaluated retrospectively. the time buried under the rubble, demographic data, type of medical and surgical therapies performed, type of injury and data on infection were analysed. between 17 august and 25 september 1999, 630 trauma victims were received at our hospital and 532 (84%) of them were hospitalized. the mean age of hospitalized patients (312 males, 220 females) was 32 years (2-90 years). two hundred and twenty patients were hospitalized for more than 48 h. forty-one of them (18.6%) had 43 hospital-acquired infection (hai) episodes, which were mostly wound infections (46.5%). a total of 143 culture specimens was collected and 48 yielded the following potential pathogens: 15 acinetobacter baumanii (31.2%), nine staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), seven pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.6%), six escherichia coli (12.5%), six klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), two stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.2%) and three various pseudomonas spp. (6.3%). all s. aureus strains were found to be resistant to methicillin in vitro. two strains of a. baumannii and one p. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to all antimicrobials including carbapenems. fifty-three victims died (10%) and 36 of those died during the first 48 h because of severe injuries and multi-organ failure. after 48 h of hospitalization, the mortality rate was significantly higher in those patients with hai (14/41) than those without (3/179) (34.1% vs. 1.7%, p<0.05). in conclusion, trauma is the significant factor associated with hai and a high incidence of acinetobacter strains was responsible for hai in trauma patients.
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.
[in vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam combination on hospital isolates and regression curve].
minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of piperacillin (p) in combination with  4 micrograms/ml of tazobactam (t) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,245 strains isolated in 4 hospitals. in addition antibiograms by agar diffusion were performed with disks loaded of 75 micrograms of p + 10 micrograms of t. for naturally non beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae (e), mic 50 and 90% of p + t were (microgram/ml): e. coli 1-2; p. mirabilis: 0.5-1; activity was practically identical on plasmid mediated penicillinase (pase) producing strains. strains of k. pneumoniae only resistant (r) to amino- and carboxypenicillins (c) had mics less than or equal to 4 (mode mic 2); mics of strains r to cephalothin and/or cefotaxime were 2 to 16 (mode mic 4). for chromosomal cephalosporinase (case) producing species, mics of p + t were less than or equal to 8, including for acquired pase producing strains, but were greater than or equal to 16 for case hyperproducing strains. strains of p. aeruginosa susceptible (s) to c were inhibited by 1 to 16 (with mic 4) and strains r to c by 8 to greater than 128. mics were generally 2 to 32 for a. baumannii s to c at 0.12 to greater than 128 for strains r to c. haemophilus, s or r to ampicillin, were inhibited by 0.008 to 2 (mic 50 and 90: 0.016-0.12). s. aureus s to methicillin (m), pase producing on not, were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 (mode mic 1) and strains r to m by 8 to greater than 128. activity of p + t for coagulase-staphylococci was similar.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
