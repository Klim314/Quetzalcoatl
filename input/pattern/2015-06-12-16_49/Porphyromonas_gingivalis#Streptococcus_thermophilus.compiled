TI  - Effects of Streptococcus thermophilus on volatile sulfur compounds produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Halitosis as oral malodour is an unpleasant odour caused by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). VSCs are produced primarily by anaerobic bacteria that abundantly produce proteinase as trypsin-like enzyme. General therapies, such as mouthwash and plaque control, do not provide a continuous effect on oral halitosis. Streptococcus thermophilus is a probiotic bacterium that is beneficial for human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of S. thermophilus on Porphyromonas gingivalis-producing VSCs and to analyze the inhibitory mechanism of halitosis. P. gingivalis was cultured with or without S. thermophilus, and the emission of VSCs from the spent culture medium was measured by gas chromatography. In order to analyze the inhibitory effect, the antibacterial activity of S. thermophilus against P. gingivalis was assessed. After the spent culture medium or whole bacterial of S. thermophilus was mixed with the spent culture medium of P. gingivalis, VSCs were again measured by gas chromatograph. When S. thermophilus and P. gingivalis were co-cultivated, VSCs were present at a lower level than those of single-cultured P. gingivalis. S. thermophilus inhibited growth of P. gingivalis, and the whole bacteria and the spent culture medium of S. thermophilus reduced emission of VSCs gas. S. thermophilus may reduce oral malodour by inhibition of P. gingivalis growth and neutralizing VSCs with their metabolites or themselves.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
