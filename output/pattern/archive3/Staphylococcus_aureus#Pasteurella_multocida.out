emerging issues in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from food-producing animals.
abstract during the last decade, antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals has become a major research topic. in this review, different emerging resistance properties related to bacteria of food-producing animals are highlighted. these include: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae; carbapenemase-producing bacteria; bovine respiratory tract pathogens, such as pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica, which harbor the multiresistance mediating integrative and conjugative element icepmu1; gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that carry the multiresistance gene cfr; and the occurrence of numerous novel antimicrobial resistance genes in livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the emergence of the aforementioned resistance properties is mainly based on the exchange of mobile genetic elements that carry the respective resistance genes.
new derivatives of salicylamides: preparation and antimicrobial activity against  various bacterial species.
three series of salicylanilides, esters of n-phenylsalicylamides and 2-hydroxy-n-[1-(2-hydroxyphenylamino)-1-oxoalkan-2-yl]benzamides, in total thirty target compounds were synthesized and characterized. the compounds were evaluated against seven bacterial and three mycobacterial strains. the antimicrobial activities of some compounds were comparable or higher than the standards ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or isoniazid. derivatives 3f demonstrated high biological activity against staphylococcus aureus (0.03mumol/l), mycobacterium marinum (0.40mumol/l) and mycobacterium kansasii (1.58mumol/l), 3g shows activity against clostridium perfringens (0.03mumol/l) and bacillus cereus (0.09mumol/l), 3h against pasteurella multocida (0.03mumol/l) and m. kansasii (0.43mumol/l), 3i against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and b. cereus (0.03mumol/l). the structure-activity relationships are discussed for all the compounds.
ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 pasteurella species isolates.
more than 5 million americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is fda approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis), including those containing methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). there are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida and pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. we therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. mics were determined using the broth microdilution method according to clsi guidelines. comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (smx-tmp). ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 pasteurella species, including p. multocida subsp. multocida and p. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum mic of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (mic(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and smx-tmp (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also very active against all s. aureus isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other staphylococcus and streptococcus species, with a maximum mic of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving p. multocida, other pasteurella species, and aerobic gram-positive isolates, including s. aureus.
[isolation, identification and bioactivity characterization of goose avian beta-defensin 3].
the objective of the study was to clone avian beta-defensin (avbd) 3 gene from goose tissues, express the recombinant avbd3 protein in escherichia coli, and determine its antimicrobial activity. the mrna of goose avbd3 was cloned from spleen and bursa of fabricius of the gooses by rt-pcr. the sequence analysis showed that the genefragment of avbd3 contained 182 bp, and encoded 60 amino acids. homology analysis showed that goose avbd3 shared the highest percentage of amino acid homology (100%) with chicken avbd3. the cdna of goose avbd3 was sub-cloned into bamh i and sal i sites of pgex-6p-1 vector to construct recombinant plasmid pgex-goose avbd3. the recombinant plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl21 and the bacteria was induced with iptg it was demonstrated by sds-page that a 31 kda protein which was equal to goose avbd3 protein in molecular weight was highly expressed. the purified recombinant goose avbd3 exhibited extensive antimicrobial activity against twelve bacteria strains, including gram-positive and gram-negative investigated. at high salt ions conditions, antimicrobial activity of recombinant goose avbd3 protein against both staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella multocida decreased significantly. in addition, hemolysis activity of the recombinant protein was extremely low, and the recombinant protein remained antimicrobial activity under different ph values.
functional analysis and induction of four novel goose (anser cygnoides) avian beta-defensins in response to salmonella enteritidis infection.
in the current study, four novel avian beta-defensins (avbds) (avbd2, 5, 9, and 10) were identified in tissues from the chinese goose (anser cygnoides). the antibacterial activity of the avbds showed that all of these avbds exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated (p<0.01). in addition, antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella multocida decreased significantly or was completely abolished at 150mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. avbd2 and avbd10 were expressed widely, whereas avbd5 and avbd9 mrnas were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues. avbd9 was significantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after salmonella enteritidis infection. the others were significantly upregulated in small intestine and some immune tissues of the geese (p<0.01). the present results suggest that the avbds are part of the host defense mechanism of the goose.
identification and characterization of a novel antibacterial peptide, avian beta-defensin 2 from ducks.
in this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (avbd) was isolated from duck pancreas. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an 195 bp open reading frame encoding 64 amino acids. homology, characterization and comparison of the gene with avbd from other avian species confirmed that it was duck avbd2. the mrna expression of the gene was analyzed in 17 tissues from 21-day-old ducks. avbd2 was highly expressed in the trachea, crop, heart, bone marrow, and pancreas; moderately expressed in the muscular stomach, small intestine, kidney, spleen, thymus, and bursa of fabricius; and weakly expressed in skin. we produced and purified recombinant avbd2 by expressing the gene in escherichia coli. as expected, the recombinant peptide exhibited strong bactericidal properties against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and pasteurella multocida, and weak bactericidal properties against e. coli and salmonella choleraesuis. in addition, the recombinant protein retained antimicrobial activity against s. aureus under different temperatures (range, -20 degrees c to 100 degrees c) and ph values (range, 3 to 12).
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal. all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.
comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
we studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/l with only 4/5 campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/l for inhibition. ertapenem was only moderately active (mic 8 mg/l) against 4/6 enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. all pasteurella multocida, pasteurella septica, pasteurella canis, pasteurella dagmatis, moraxella spp. and ef-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/l. mic(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/l; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/l; staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/l; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/l; eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/l; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/l. for anaerobes the range of mics and mic(90)s were: prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/l; porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/l; fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/l; bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/l; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/l. ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
synthesis and structure-activity relationships of thiotetronic acid analogues of  thiolactomycin.
3-acetyl analogues of thiolactomycin, a thiotetronic acid natural product, were synthesized and profiled against livestock pathogens. some analogues showed improved activity over thiolactomycin against staphylococcus aureus and comparable activity against pasteurella multocida. several semisynthetically modified analogues of thiolactomycin showed no improvement in activity over thiolactomycin.
comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
we studied the comparative in vitro activities of abt-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu for anaerobes. the following are the mic ranges and mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of abt-773 for various isolates, respectively: pasteurella multocida and pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. for anaerobes the mic ranges and mic(90)s of abt-773 were as follows, respectively: prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml; fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. abt-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against s. aureus, e. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against f. nucleatum. the activity of abt-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against pasteurella spp., and abt-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against pasteurella spp. abt-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.
species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
bovine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor enhancement of bovine neutrophil functions in vitro.
neutrophils were purified from blood of dexamethasone-treated (0.04 mg/kg of body weight) and untreated calves. cells were untreated (controls) or cultured in media containing 5 or 10 ng of bovine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rbgm-csf)/ml for 10 to 12 hours before being tested for various functions. dexamethasone treatment of calves decreased luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, decreased phagocytosis of pasteurella multocida and several staphylococcus spp by various degrees, and decreased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against bovine herpesvirus-infected cells by 26 to 32%. the percentage phagocytosis of coagulase-positive s aureus and s intermedius was higher than that of coagulase-negative s epidermidis for neutrophils from all calves. culture of neutrophils with rbgm-csf significantly increased (p less than 0.05) all of the aforementioned functions, compared with control neutrophils; however, rbgm-csf-induced increases in function tended to be higher in neutrophils from dexamethasone-treated calves than in neutrophils from untreated calves.
comparative in-vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
the comparative in-vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l). among other gram-positive organisms tested, a significant number were resistant to a-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. a-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against pasteurella multocida and campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against legionella spp. (mic90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l) and bact. melaninogenicus (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). activity of a-56268 was ph dependent (more active at ph 7 than at ph 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. the drug was bactericidal against two strains of streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against staphylococcus aureus and str. faecalis.
effect of type a pasteurella multocida fractions on bovine polymorphonuclear leukocyte functions.
the effect of various pasteurella multocida fractions on bovine polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) functions was examined in vitro by using two encapsulated strains, p-2383 and p-1062 (both are carter capsular type a and of bovine origin). the ability of pmns to ingest staphylococcus aureus and iodinate protein was significantly inhibited in the presence of live cells, heat-killed whole cells, or saline-extracted capsules but not in the presence of the decapsulated heat-killed cells. none of the fractions of the two strains inhibited nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by pmns. the saline extract did not inhibit the binding of iodine to protein by a reaction involving xanthine, xanthine oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase. the pmn inhibitory factor was further characterized as a heat-stable capsular material of greater than 300,000 molecular weight.
a direct fluorescent antibody test for identification of group e streptococci.
a rapid and specific direct fluorescent antibody test was developed for the identification of group e streptococci (ges). tests for specificity included an inhibition test and application of the conjugate to smears of staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and streptococci of lancefield's groups, a, b, c, d, e (types i, iv and untypeable), f and g. with the inhibition test, a specific blocking reaction occurred and the conjugate cross-reacted only with group c streptococci (gcs). adsorption with gcs eliminated the cross-reaction and rendered the conjugate specific for ges.
