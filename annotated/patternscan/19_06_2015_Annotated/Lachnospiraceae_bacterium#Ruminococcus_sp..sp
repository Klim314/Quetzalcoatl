TI  == murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  == three strains of an anaerobic, gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. these strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16s rrna gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family lachnospiraceae (<94 %). the most closely related species with names that  have standing in nomenclature were robinsoniella peoriensis, ruminococcus gnavus, blautia producta and clostridium xylanolyticum. phylogenetic relationships based  on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60  genes. the use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for ruminococcus gnavus and b. producta. all three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by c16 : 0 methyl ester. differences in the proportions of c12 : 0 methyl ester, c14 : 0 methyl ester and  c18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically  neighbouring species. the major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain srb-530-5-h(t) was acetic acid. this strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species robinsoniella peoriensis. the isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains srb-530-5-h(t) ( = dsm 26524(t) = ccug 63391(t)) (the type strain of murimonas intestini), srb-509-4-s-h ( = dsm 27577 = ccug 64595) and srb-524-4-s-h ( = dsm 27578 = ccug 64594).

TI  == acetatifactor muris gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the intestine of an obese mouse.
AB  == we used selective agar media for culturing bacteria from the caecum of mice fed a high calorie diet. in addition to the isolation of enterobacteriaceae growing on  a medium containing cholesterol and bile salts, we focused on the characterization of strain ct-m2(t), which, based on 16s rdna analysis, did not appear to correspond to any currently described organisms. the isolate belongs to the clostridium cluster xiv and is most closely related to members of the lachnospiraceae, including the genera anaerostipes, blautia, butyrivibrio, clostridium, coprococcus, eubacterium, robinsoniella, roseburia, ruminococcus and syntrophococcus (</=90 % similarity). strain ct-m2(t) is a non-motile gram-positive rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 48.5 %. cells grow under strictly anoxic conditions (100 % n(2)) and produce acetate and butyrate after growth in reduced wca broth. in contrast to related species, the new bacterium does not metabolize glucose and is positive for phenylalanine arylamidase, and its major cellular fatty acid is c(1)(4):(0). based on phylogenetic and phenotypic studies, the isolate merits recognition as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the name acetatifactor muris is proposed. the type strain is ct-m2(t) (= dsm 23669(t) = atcc baa-2170(t)).

TI  == blautia faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == a strictly anoxic, gram-stain-positive, non-motile blautia-like bacterium, designated strain m25(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. strain m25(t)  was negative for both catalase and oxidase activity, utilized carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced lactate and acetate as the major end products of glucose fermentation in pyg medium, and had a dna g+c content of 41.6 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that strain m25(t) was closely related to ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (96.40 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and blautia glucerasea hfth-1(t) (96.17 %) within the family lachnospiraceae. straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated cellular fatty acids were also detected, the majority being c(14 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) dimethyl acetal acids. based on the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics presented in this study, strain m25(t) represents a novel species within the genus blautia for which the name blautia faecis sp. nov. is proposed.  the type strain is m25(t) ( = kctc 5980(t) = jcm 17205(t)).

TI  == dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), yaks (bos  grunniens) and yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in gayals, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle were investigated using pcr-dgge approach. the analysis of dgge profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16s rdna sequences in  dgge profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. dgge profiles revealed that gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of  intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. a total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. according to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen  dominant bacteria of gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the  genera lachnospiraceae bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium celerecrescens. moreover, the dominant bacteria of yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, schwartzia succinivorans and clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. in addition, the dominant bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing prevotella sp., staphylococci lentus, staphylococcus xylosus and corynebacterium casei. present study first detected staphylococcus lentus and staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.
