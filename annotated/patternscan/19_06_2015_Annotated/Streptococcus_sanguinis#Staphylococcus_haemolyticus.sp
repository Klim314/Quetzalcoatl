TI  == decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  == objective: four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. the solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. method and materials: twenty volunteers wore splints  with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. the bacteria were first examined microscopically by gram staining. these samples  from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. results: compared to untreated controls, significant (p < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. the reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. conclusion: the irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. the highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. taking this into  consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.

TI  == [protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  == microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific iga1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged  to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. nonspecific proteolytic activity  was found in the following microorganisms: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, aerococcus viridans, bifidobacterium longum, neisseria subflave, streptococcus parvulus, eubacterium alactolyticum, lactobaccilus catenoforme, bacillus spp. specific iga1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards igg was found in streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus hansenii, streptococcus salivarius, leptotrychia buccalis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and  neisseria sicca. no proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), prevotella buccalis, aerococcus viridans and streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci. quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/l, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/l, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/l and enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/l.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
