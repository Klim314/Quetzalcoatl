TI  == salivary microbiota associated with immunoglobulin a nephropathy.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan). fourteen healthy volunteers (hc) were used as control. compared to hc, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of igan patients. total bacteria from salivary samples of igan patients and hc subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene. paired t test showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (otu,  ace, chao1, and shannon index) between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients. the difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. compared to hc, the ratio between  firmicutes/proteobacteria markedly decreased in igan patients. gemella haemolysins, granulicatella adiacens, and veillonella parvula were positively associated (p < 0.05) with hc. within the phylum bacteroidetes, prevotella species (prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella pallens, and prevotella salivae) were the highest in hc. the only exception was for prevotella aurantiaca. compared to hc, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to pasteurellaceae family (e.g., haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in igan patients. fusobacteriaceae (fusobacterium) and corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients.

TI  == antibacterial epipolythiodioxopiperazine and unprecedented sesquiterpene from pseudallescheria boydii, a beetle (coleoptera)-associated fungus.
AB  == pseudallescheria boydii residing in the gut of coleopteran (holotrichia parallela) larva produces four new epipolythiodioxopiperazine (etp) boydines a-d  (3-6) and two novel sesquiterpene boydenes a (7) and b (10), in addition to bisdethiobis(methylthio)-deacetylaranotin (1), bisdethiodi(methylthio)-deacetylapoaranotin (2), am6898 a (8) and ovalicin (9). the structure elucidation was accomplished by a combination of spectral methods with quantum chemical calculations of optical rotations and electronic circular dichroism (ecd) spectra. boydine b (4) was shown to be active against the clinical strains bifidobacterium sp., veillonella parvula, anaerostreptococcus sp., bacteroides vulgatus and peptostreptococcus sp. with an mic range of 0.2-0.8 mum, and the pharmacophore 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyl-5-oxooct-6-enoyl chain of 4  was shown to have (2r,3s,4s)-configurations. boydene a (7) possessed an unprecedented carbon skeleton, suggesting an unusual biochemistry that allows an  intramolecular aldol addition in the fungus. collectively, the finding may inspire the discovery of new antibacterial agents and the understanding on biosyntheses of polythiodioxopiperazine and sesquiterpene metabolites.

TI  == veillonella seminalis sp. nov., a novel anaerobic gram-stain-negative coccus from human clinical samples, and emended description of the genus veillonella.
AB  == ten isolates of unknown, gram-stain-negative, anaerobic cocci were recovered from human clinical samples, mainly from semen. on the basis of their phenotypic features, including morphology, main metabolic end products, gas production, nitrate reduction and decarboxylation of succinate, the strains were identified as members of the genus veillonella. multi-locus sequence analysis and corresponding phylogenies were based on 16s rrna, dnak and rpob genes, and on the newly proposed glta gene. the strains shared high levels of genetic sequence similarity and were related most closely to veillonella ratti. the strains could  not be differentiated from v. ratti on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis while glta, rpob and dnak gene sequences showed 85.1, 93.5 and 90.2% similarity with those of the type strain of v. ratti, respectively. phylogenetic  analyses revealed that the isolates formed a robust clade in the v. ratti-veillonella criceti-veillonella magna subgroup of the genus veillonella. as observed for v. criceti, the isolates were able to ferment fructose. in contrast  to other members of the genus veillonella, the 10 strains were not able to metabolize lactate. cellular fatty acid composition was consistent with that of other species of the genus veillonella. from these data, the 10 isolates are considered to belong to a novel species in the genus veillonella, for which the name veillonella seminalis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is adv 4313.2(t) ( = cip 107810(t) = lmg 28162(t)). veillonella strain acs-216-v-col6b subjected to whole genome sequencing as part as the human microbiome project is another representative of v. seminalis sp. nov. an emended description of the genus veillonella is also proposed.

TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

TI  == salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (sp) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. methods: titanium discs were allocated into a control group (ti) and an experimental group (tin - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). the disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). stimulated, clarified, and  filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. proteome analysis of the adsorbed sp proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). the surface free energy (sfe) was evaluated before and after sp formation. a multispecies biofilm composed of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella  dispar, and candida albicans was developed on the sp-coated discs. viable microorganism counts were determined. the biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) with comstat  software. the biofilm organization was visualized by sem. results: the surface topography was similar in both groups. the sfe of the tin group did not differ from that of the ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins  increased the sfe in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). different proteins were identified on the ti and tin surfaces. the amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of f. nucleatum and s. oralis were higher in the tin group (p<0.001). similar biofilms were characterized by the comstat data, clsm images, and sem images. conclusion: the titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in sp composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.

TI  == altered bacterial profiles in saliva from adults with caries lesions: a case-cohort study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to learn whether presence of caries in an adult population was associated with a salivary bacterial profile different from that of individuals without untreated caries. stimulated saliva samples from 621 participants of the danish health examination survey were analyzed using the human oral microbe identification microarray technology. samples from 174 individuals with dental caries and 447 from a control cohort were compared using  frequency and levels of identified bacterial taxa/clusters as endpoints. differences at taxon/cluster level were analyzed using mann-whitney's test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles. a reduced bacterial  diversity was observed in samples from subjects with dental caries. five bacterial taxa (veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica, megasphaera micronuciformis, fusobacterium periodontium and achromobacter xylosoxidans) and one bacterial cluster (leptotrichia sp. clones c3mkm102 and gt018_ot417/462) were less frequently found in the caries group (adjusted p value <0.01) while two bacterial taxa (solobacterium moorei and streptococcus salivarius) and three bacterial clusters (streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sp. clone be024_ot057/411/721, streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sinensis_ot411/721/767, streptococcus salivarius and sp. clone fo042_ot067/755) were present at significantly higher levels (adjusted p value <0.01). the principal component analysis displayed a marked difference in the bacterial community profiles between groups. presence of manifest caries was associated with a reduced diversity and an altered salivary bacterial community profile. our data support recent theories that ecological stress-induced changes of commensal  microbial communities are involved in the shift from oral health to tooth decay.

TI  == effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  == licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional chimese medicines. however, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate  to exert physiological effects. therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, six strains, comprising bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, bacillus sp. 46 and clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. a total  of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. the results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin.  on the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an emax precision microplate reader. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and  bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium was less severely affected.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.

TI  == an antibacterial metabolite from lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae f2.
AB  == in searching for symbionts derived from bioactive natural products, six sulfureous diketopiperazines designated as lasiodiplines a-f (1-6) were characterized from the culture of lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae f2, previously residing in the apparently normal flower of illigera rhodantha (hernandiaceae). identification of structures was accomplished by a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches, in conjunction with the low-temperature (100k) single-crystal x-ray diffraction with cu kalpha radiation. lasiodipline e (5) was demonstrated to be antibacterial against the clinical strains streptococcus sp.,  bacteroides vulgates, peptostreptococcus sp. and veillonella parvula, respectively, with an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.12-0.25 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 4 and 6 exemplify two unusual architectures of natural cyclodipeptides, signifying the unique biochemical characteristics of the producing fungus.

TI  == illumina sequencing of the v4 hypervariable region 16s rrna gene reveals extensive changes in bacterial communities in the cecum following carbohydrate oral infusion and development of early-stage acute laminitis in the horse.
AB  == in the equine carbohydrate overload model of acute laminitis, disease progression is associated with changes in bacteria found in the cecum. to date, research has  focused on changes in specific gram-positive bacteria in this portion of the intestinal tract. metagenomic methods are now available making it possible to interrogate microbial communities using animal protocols that sufficiently power  a study. in this study, the microbiota in cecal fluid collected from control, non-laminitic horses (n=8) and from horses with early-stage acute laminitis induced with either oligofructan (n=6) or cornstarch (n=6) were profiled. the microbiota were identified based on sequencing the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene. the results of the study show that the relative abundance of lactobacillus sp. and streptococcus sp. increased significantly (p<0.05) following of and cs infusion. other significant changes included an increase (p<0.05) in relative abundance of veillonella sp. and serratia sp., two potentially pathogenic, gram-negative bacteria. significant decreases in the relative abundance of presumptive normal flora were detected as well. although changes in cecal microbiota described in this communication are from a pilot study, it is hypothesized that an overgrowth of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria develops and contributes to enterocolitis, pyrexia and lameness in the carbohydrate overload model of acute laminitis.

TI  == analysis of the airway microbiota of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by t-rflp and clone sequencing.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive, inflammatory lung  disease that affects a large number of patients and has significant impact. one hallmark of the disease is the presence of bacteria in the lower airways. objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the detailed structure of microbial communities found in the lungs of healthy individuals and patients with copd. nine copd patients as compared and 9 healthy individuals underwent flexible bronchoscopy and bal was performed. bacterial nucleic acids were subjected to terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and clone library analysis. overall, we identified 326 t-rflp band, 159 in patients and 167 in healthy controls. the results of the trf analysis correlated partly with the data obtained from clone sequencing. although the results of the sequencing showed high diversity, the genera prevotella, sphingomonas, pseudomonas, acinetobacter,  fusobacterium, megasphaera, veillonella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus constituted the major part of the core microbiome found in both groups. a trf band possibly representing pseudomonas sp. monoinfection was associated with a reduction of the microbial diversity. non-cultural methods reveal the complexity  of the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals and in patients with copd. alterations of the microbiome in pulmonary diseases are correlated with disease.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == identification of veillonella tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm by using a species-specific primer pair.
AB  == veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, and veillonella rogosae have been reported to be isolated from human oral cavities. the recently detected veillonellatobetsuensis in human tongue biofilms was proposed as a novel veillonella sp. in this study, to determine the  distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis, we established a method for the detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using a species-specific primer pair. the primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 70-kda heat shock protein (dnak) gene of v. tobetsuensis jcm 17976(t) (=atcc baa-2400(t)). the primer pair generated a specific pcr product for v. tobetsuensis but not for other oral veillonella spp. with the pcr procedure using the primer pair, we could detect less than 10 ng of genomic dna extracted from v. tobetsuensis. thus, the pcr method using this primer pair is suitable for the specific detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis. the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis were investigated by pcr using this species-specific primer pair. v. tobetsuensis was detected in 5 of 27 subjects. v. tobetsuensis was recovered from 19% (5/27) of subjects with other veillonella species. and, prevalence of v. tobetsuensis ranged from 7.6% to 20.0% in these subjects. v. tobetsuensis is likely to coexist with other veillonella spp. in tongue biofilm.  in this study, the species-specific pcr primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed using partial sequences of the dnak gene. this is the first report using a species-specific primer pair for pcr to determine the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm.

TI  == identification of isoquercitrin metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms) and the metabolynx software combined with mass  defect filtering were applied to identity the metabolites of isoquercitrin using  an intestinal mixture of bacteria and 96 isolated strains from human feces. the human incubated samples collected for 72 h in the anaerobic incubator and extracted with ethyl acetate were analyzed by uplc-q-tof/ms within 10 min. the parent compound and five metabolites were identified by eight isolated strains, including bacillus sp. 17, veillonella sp. 23 and 32 and bacteroides sp. 40, 41,  56, 75 and 88 in vitro. the results indicate that quercetin, acetylated isoquercitrin, dehydroxylated isoquercitrin, hydroxylated quercetin and hydroxymethylated quercetin are the major metabolites of isoquercitrin. furthermore, a possible metabolic pathway for the biotransformation of isoquercitrin was established in intestinal flora. this study will be helpful for understanding the metabolic route of isoquercitrin and the role of different intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of natural compounds.

TI  == veillonella tobetsuensis sp. nov., an anaerobic, gram-negative coccus isolated from human tongue biofilms.
AB  == four previously unknown, gram-negative, anaerobic coccal strains were isolated from the tongue biofilm of healthy human adults (ages 22-29 years). the isolates  displayed all phenotypic characteristics of the genus veillonella. comparative analysis of the 16s rrna, dnak and rpob gene sequences indicated that the four strains were phylogenetically homogeneous and comprised a distinct novel lineage  within the genus veillonella. the production of major cellular fatty acids (c13 : 0 and c17 : 1omega8) was consistent with that of other members of the genus veillonella. based on these observations, strains b16(t), a16, b4 and y6 represent a novel species, for which the name veillonella tobetsuensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain b16(t) ( = jcm 17976(t) = atcc baa-2400(t)).

TI  == identification of rutin deglycosylated metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, rutin was metabolized by human intestinal bacteria and five isolated strains including bacillus sp. 52, bacteroides sp. 45, 42, 22 and veillonella sp. 32, the metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms). as a result, bacillus sp. 52 and bacteroides sp. 45 could metabolize rutin to quercetin 3-o-glucoside and leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 42 and veillonella sp. 32 could convert rutin to leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 22 could hydrolyze rutin to quercetin-3-o-glucoside. in order to further explain the metabolism pathway of rutin, the beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-rhamnosidase activities of five strains were determined. bacteroides sp. 22 could produce alpha-l-rhamnosidase but did not produce beta-d-glucosidase or beta-d-glucosidase activity was too low to be detected. the other four strains all demonstrated alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities. furthermore, alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities of veillonella sp. 32 and  bacteroides sp. 42 were higher than those of bacteroides sp. 45 and bacillus sp.  52. based on these results, we can propose the deglycosylated rout of rutin: rutin was metabolized to be quercetin-3-o-glucoside by alpha-l-rhamnosidase produced from these bacteria, thereafter, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was further metabolized by beta-d-glucosidase to form leucocyanidin. because of the higher enzyme activity in veillonella sp. 32 and bacteroides sp. 42, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was completely metabolized to leucocyanidin by these two  bacteria. due to the lack of beta-d-glucosidase activity, bacteroides sp. 22 could not further metabolize quercetin-3-o-glucoside to leucocyanidin. this study will be helpful for understanding the deglycosylated rout of rutin and the role of different intestinal bacteria on the metabolism of natural compounds.

AB  == objective: bacterial species have been found harboring the internal surface of dental implants as consequence of their failed connections. the aim of the present study was to compare the detection frequency of bacterial leakage from human saliva through the implant-abutment interface, under non-loading conditions, using either dna checkerboard or culture method. materials and methods: thirty dental implants with hexagonal platforms were connected to pre-machined abutments according to the manufacturers' specifications. the assemblies were individually incubated in human saliva under anaerobic conditions for 7 days at 37 degrees c. afterward, contents from the inner parts of the implants were collected and evaluated with either dna checkerboard (s = 15) or culture (n = 15). subsequently, identification and quantitation of bacterial species from saliva and implants were carried out for the group evaluated with the dna checkerboard method. results: both dna checkerboard and culture showed positive signals of bacterial leakage in 6 of the 15 evaluated samples. capnocytophaga gingivalis and streptococcus mutans were the most frequently detected species harboring the internal surface of the implants followed by veillonella parvula. conclusion: occurrence of bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface is comparably detected with both dna checkerboard hybridization and conventional culture methods.

TI  == microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  == it is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. pyrosequencing targeting the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. the bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. clustering and venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. traditional fecal indicators, i.e., escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. besides the bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., parasutterella excrementihominis, veillonella sp., dialister invisus, megamonas funiformis, and ruminococcus lactaris for the human and lactobacillus amylovorus and atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. these microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent  on the absence or presence of a single indicator. monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == olsenella umbonata sp. nov., a microaerotolerant anaerobic lactic acid bacterium  from the sheep rumen and pig jejunum, and emended descriptions of olsenella, olsenella uli and olsenella profusa.
AB  == strain a2 is an anaerobic, variably gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming, small and irregularly rod-shaped bacterium from the ruminal fluid of a sheep that has been described informally as a representative of 'olsenella (basonym atopobium) oviles'. three phenotypically similar bacterial strains (lac15, lac16 and lac31(t)) were isolated in concert with veillonella magna lac18(t) from the mucosal jejunum of a pig. a phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that strains a2, lac15, lac16 and lac31(t) formed a genetically coherent group (100 % interstrain sequence similarity) within the bigeneric olsenella-atopobium branch of the family coriobacteriaceae, class actinobacteria. this group was most closely related to the type strains of the two recognized olsenella species, namely olsenella uli (sequence similarity of 96.85 %) and olsenella profusa (sequence similarity of 97.20 %). the sequence similarity to the type strain of atopobium minutum, the type species of the genus atopobium, was 92.33 %. unlike those of o. uli and o. profusa, outgrown colonies  of strains a2, lac15, lac16 and lac31(t) were opaque and greyish-white with an umbonate elevation on solid culture media. the four novel strains were characterized as being well-adapted and presumably indigenous to the gastrointestinal tract of homoeothermic vertebrates: they were mesophilic, microaerotolerant, neutrophilic and acidotolerant, bile-resistant, mucin-utilizing and markedly peptidolytic lactic acid bacteria. the results of dna-dna hybridizations, cellular fatty acid analysis and other differential phenotypic (physiological and biochemical) tests confirmed that strains a2, lac15, lac16 and lac31(t) represent a novel species of the genus olsenella. on the basis of the genotypic and phenotypic results, we therefore describe olsenella umbonata sp. nov., with lac31(t) ( = ccug 58604(t) = dsm 22620(t) = jcm 16156(t)) as the type strain and a2 ( = ccug 58212 = dsm 22619 = jcm 16157) as an additionally available reference strain. also, based on our data, we propose emended descriptions of the genus olsenella and the species olsenella uli and olsenella profusa.

TI  == microbial equol production attenuates colonic methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis  in vitro.
AB  == hydrogen gas produced during colonic fermentation is excreted in breath and flatus, or removed by hydrogen-consuming bacteria such as methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria. however, recent research has shown that h2 is also consumed by equol-producing bacteria during the reduction of daidzein into equol. in this study, the interactions between methanogens, sulphate-reducing, and equol-producing bacteria were investigated under in vitro simulated intestinal conditions. in the presence of daidzein, the equol-producing bacterial consortium epc4 gave rise to equol production in cultures of methanobrevibacter smithii or desulfovibrio sp. as well as in faecal samples with methanogenic or sulphate-reducing abilities. moreover, this supplementation significantly (p<0.001) decreased the methanogenesis and sulphidogenesis. the attenuation did not occur in the absence of a daidzein source. additionally, there was no influence of soy germ powder, daidzein or equol as such, excluding a possible inhibition by these compounds. finally, a stronger decrease was observed with increasing amounts of epc4 and a constant equol production, suggesting that the observed effect was only partly caused by the action of daidzein as a hydrogen sink. these findings are of relevance since abdominal discomfort such as bloating and flatulence, are related to colonic gas production, whereas equol has potential health benefits.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans builds mutualistic biofilm communities with fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella species in saliva.
AB  == human oral bacterial pathogens grow in attached multispecies biofilm communities. unattached cells are quickly removed by swallowing. therefore, surface attachment is essential for growth, and we investigated multispecies community interactions  resulting in mutualistic growth on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we used two model systems, saliva-coated transferable solid-phase polystyrene pegs (peg biofilms) and flow cells with saliva-coated glass surfaces. fluorescent antibody  staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in flow cells, and  quantitative real-time pcr with species-specific primers was used to quantify the biomass in peg biofilms. veillonella sp. strain pk1910, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans jp2, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 were unable to  grow as single species in flow cells. only a. actinomycetemcomitans grew after 36 h when peg biofilms remained submerged in saliva from the time of inoculation. mixed-species coaggregates were used for two- and three-species inoculation. the  biomass in two-species biofilms increased in both systems when veillonella sp. strain pk1910 was present as one of the partners. enhanced growth of all strains  was observed in three-species biofilms in flow cells. interestingly, in flow cells f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans exhibited mutualism, and, although f. nucleatum was unable to grow with either of the other species in the  peg system, f. nucleatum stimulated the growth of veillonella sp. and together these two organisms increased the total biomass of a. actinomycetemcomitans in three-species peg biofilms. we propose that mutualistic two-species and multispecies oral biofilm communities form in vivo and that mutualism between commensal veillonellae and late colonizing pathogens, such as aggregatibacteria,  contributes to the development of periodontal disease.

(7.30-/+0.89 copies/ml) and veillonella sp. (8.29-/+0.77 copies/ml) in group t were significantly lower than those in group n (8.15-/+0.55 and 8.93-/+0.76 copies/ml, respectively, p<0.01), but similar with those in group c. the quantity of streptococcus sp. (7.51-/+0.81 copies/ml) in group c was significantly lower than that in group n (8.15-/+0.55 copies/ml, p<0.01), but the quantity of veillonella sp. was similar between the two groups. no significant difference were found in the quantity of neisseria sp. between the 3 groups. conclusion: the quantity of oral microflora differs significantly between patients with recurrent oral ulcers and normal individuals, suggesting a possible correlation between oral microfora and recurrent oral ulcers.

TI  == characterization of the complex bacterial communities colonizing biliary stents reveals a host-dependent diversity.
AB  == this study provides a comprehensive survey of the spatial and temporal bacterial  composition of biliary stent biofilms. the bacterial diversity, distribution and  dynamics of 59 biliary and 4 pancreatic stent communities from 40 patients being  treated at two different hospitals, which implant stents either simultaneously or consecutively, were characterized by single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis. fifty-one phylotypes belonging to 5 bacterial phyla and 24 bacterial families were detected across 63 stents. this is a much broader diversity than previously detected through culture-dependent methods, particularly in regard to the diversity of obligate anaerobes. stent bacterial diversity was patient-dependent and more similar when stents were implanted simultaneously rather than consecutively. stent bacterial community composition differed between hospitals specifically because of the difference in abundance of bifidobacteria. co-colonization of veillonella sp., streptococcus anginosus and organisms closely related to fusobacterium nucleatum revealed a potentially important attachment and survival strategy that has yet to be reported in biliary stents. this work reveals a more complete survey of the identities of bacterial species that form biofilms in biliary stents, their co-colonization patterns and  the natural variation in species composition between different patients, hospitals and locations along the stent. consideration of the community composition from individual patients will allow tailoring of prophylactic antibiotic treatments and thus will make the management of stent biofilms more effective.

AB  == a bacterium, designated strain lac18(t), was isolated in pure culture from the mucosal jejunum of a healthy pig, using a medium selective for anaerobic lactic acid bacteria and containing porcine gastric mucin as the main carbon and nitrogen source. cells of this strain were coccus-shaped, arranged singly or in pairs and were gram-stain-negative, oxidase-negative, non-spore-forming, anaerobic and microaerotolerant. an analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences indicated that strain lac18(t) should be assigned to the genus veillonella, class clostridia, phylum firmicutes. 16s rrna and dnak gene sequence-based phylogenetic analyses both indicated that the most closely related species were veillonella ratti atcc 17746(t) (similarities of 96.6 and 84.5 %, respectively) and veillonella criceti atcc 17747(t) (similarities of 96.6 and 83.4 %, respectively). the results of dna-dna hybridizations between strain lac18(t) and  these veillonella species and the type species of the genus, veillonella parvula  dsm 2008(t), confirmed the genotypic distinctness of the novel isolate. data from phenotypic studies also served to differentiate strain lac18(t) from related strains. therefore strain lac18(t) represents a novel species of the genus veillonella, for which the name veillonella magna sp. nov. is proposed. the type  strain is lac18(t) (=ccug 55454(t)=cip 109767(t)=dsm 19857(t)=jcm 15053(t)).

AB  == joint disease ankylosing enthesopathy (ankent) naturally occurs in inbred mice with c57bl/10 genetic background. ankent has many parallels to human ankylosing spondylitis (as) and represents an animal model for as. environmental conditions  (i.e., microbial load of the organism) are among the risk factors for ankent, similar to as. the role of microflora in the development of ankent was investigated. ankent was tested in four experimental groups of germ-free mice associated with different numbers of various intestinal microbes and three control groups: germ-free, specific pathogen-free, and conventional (cv) mice. mice were colonized either with anaerobic bacteria isolated from the intestine of a cv mouse or with bacterial strains obtained from the collection of microorganisms. microbes were characterized and checked by microbiological cultivation methods and with the use of polymerase chain reaction amplification and rdna sequence analysis. joint disease developed in gf mice colonized with a mixture containing bacteroides spp. and enterococcus sp., and/or veillonella sp.  and staphylococcus sp. no ankent appeared in males colonized with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus sp. in control groups ankent occurred in spf and cv animals; the gf animals remained healthy. the results confirmed that the germ-free conditions protect from joint inflammation, and thus microbes are necessary for ankent development. in colonized mice the ankent was triggered by luminal anaerobic bacteria, which are common components of intestinal microflora.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcus sp.-veillonella sp. community micromanipulated from dental plaque.
AB  == streptococci and veillonellae occur in mixed-species colonies during formation of early dental plaque. one factor hypothesized to be important in assembly of these initial communities is coaggregation (cell-cell recognition by genetically distinct bacteria). intrageneric coaggregation of streptococci occurs when a lectin-like adhesin on one streptococcal species recognizes a receptor polysaccharide (rps) on the partner species. veillonellae also coaggregate with streptococci. these genera interact metabolically; lactic acid produced by streptococci is a carbon source for veillonellae. to transpose these interactions from undisturbed dental plaque to an experimentally tractable in vitro biofilm model, a community consisting of rps-bearing streptococci juxtaposed with veillonellae was targeted by quantum dot-based immunofluorescence and then micromanipulated off the enamel surface and cultured. besides the expected antibody-reactive cell types, a non-antibody-reactive streptococcus invisible during micromanipulation was obtained. the streptococci were identified as streptococcus oralis (rps bearing) and streptococcus gordonii (adhesin bearing).  the veillonellae could not be cultivated; however, a veillonella 16s rrna gene sequence was amplified from the original isolation mixture, and this sequence was identical to the sequence of the previously studied organism veillonella sp. strain pk1910, an oral isolate in our culture collection. s. oralis coaggregated  with s. gordonii by an rps-dependent mechanism, and both streptococci coaggregated with pk1910, which was used as a surrogate during in vitro community reconstruction. the streptococci and strain pk1910 formed interdigitated three-species clusters when grown as a biofilm using saliva as the nutritional source. pk1910 grew only when streptococci were present. this study confirms that rps-mediated intrageneric coaggregation occurs in the earliest stages of plaque formation by bringing bacteria together to create a functional community.

AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == veillonella rogosae sp. nov., an anaerobic, gram-negative coccus isolated from dental plaque.
AB  == strains of a novel anaerobic, gram-negative coccus were isolated from the supra-gingival plaque of children. independent strains from each of six subjects  were shown, at a phenotypic level and based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, to be members of the genus veillonella. analysis revealed that the six strains shared 99.7 % similarity in their 16s rrna gene sequences and 99.0 % similarity in their rpob gene sequences. the six novel strains formed a distinct group and could be clearly separated from recognized species of the genus veillonella of human or animal origin. the novel strains exhibited 98 and 91 % similarity to partial 16s  rrna and rpob gene sequences of veillonella parvula atcc 10790(t), the most closely related member of the genus. the six novel strains could be differentiated from recognized species of the genus veillonella based on partial  16s rrna and rpob gene sequencing. the six novel strains are thus considered to represent a single novel species of the genus veillonella, for which the name veillonella rogosae sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is cf100(t) (=ccug 54233(t)=dsm 18960(t)).

TI  == effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on subgingival periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: studies have shown that the nature and amount of supragingival plaque can influence the composition of the contiguous subgingival flora. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil antimicrobial mouthrinse on levels of representative subgingival bacteria in subjects with mild to moderate periodontitis. methods: this controlled study used a randomized, double-masked, 2 x 2 crossover design. after baseline subgingival sampling, 37 qualifying subjects rinsed with the essential oil mouthrinse or a negative control twice daily for 14 days, with a post-treatment sample obtained on day 15. following a washout period, the procedure was repeated with the alternative rinse. target organisms enumerated were porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella sp., and total anaerobes. intergroup comparisons of post-treatment log-transformed colony forming unit counts were made using analysis of covariance. results: after 14 days of twice-daily rinsing, the level of each of the target subgingival organisms was significantly lower in  the essential oil group than in the control group (p < 0.001), with percent reductions ranging from 66.3% to 79.2%. conclusions: rinsing with the essential oil antiplaque/antigingivitis mouthrinse can have significant antimicrobial activity against subgingival periodontopathogens. most likely, the antimicrobial  effect was mediated primarily by disruption of the contiguous supragingival plaque by the mouthrinse. because studies have shown that control of supragingival plaque can influence the onset and/or progression of periodontitis, additional studies on non-prescription antimicrobial oral care products may lead  to new regimens for decreasing the burden of periodontal diseases in the population.

TI  == veillonella denticariosi sp. nov., isolated from human carious dentine.
AB  == selective culture of human carious dentine for veillonella strains resulted in the isolation of two strains of a gram-negative, coccus-shaped bacterium that has not been described previously. comparative 16s rrna and dnak gene sequence analysis indicated that the two strains were homogeneous and comprised a distinct lineage within the genus veillonella, phylogenetically most closely related to veillonella rodentium. this was supported by dna-dna hybridization, which showed  clearly that the two strains were similar and distinct from other veillonella species, and the production of major cellular fatty acids (c(13 : 0) and c(17 : 1)omega8), which is consistent with other members of the genus veillonella. based on these observations, strains rbv81 and rbv106(t) represent a novel species, for which the name veillonella denticariosi sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain rbv106(t) (=cip 109448(t) =ccug 54362(t) =dsm 19009(t)).

TI  == a novel sampling method for the investigation of gut mirobiota.
AB  == aim: in order to characterize the qualitative and quantitative microorganisms in  different sites of the lower digestive tract (ldt) in healthy volunteers, a specific technique was developed for collecting mucous of the distal ileum, colon and rectum. methods: a polyethylene tube was designed to go through the colonoscope channel with a no.8 french tube. in order to avoid internal contamination, the distal extremity was protected with a membrane of microfilm after being sterilized in ethilene oxid. to facilitate the aspiration of a precise volume, its interior was coated with silicone. one hundred microlliter (0.1 ml) sample of mucous was collected and transferred into an eppenddorff tube  containing nine hundred microlliter (0.9 ml) of vmga-3 (viable medium of goteborg). this procedure was repeated at each site of the ldt with a new sterilized catheter. results: all sites revealed the "non pathogenic" anaerobic bacteria veillonella sp (average 10(5) colony forming units/ml-cfu/ml), allowing  to conclude an environment of low oxidation-reduction potential (redox) in the ldt. it was also characterized the presence of klebisiella sp with significant statistical predominance (ssp) in the ileum. enterobacter sp was found with ssp in the sigmoid colon, bacteroides sp non-pigmented (npg) and e.coli with ssp in the sigmoid colon and rectum, enterococcus sp and lactobacillus sp with ssp in the rectum, all in a mean concentration of 10(5) cfu/ml. conclusion: this procedure is feasible and efficient and can point out a similar distribution of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with the presence of biological markers of normal microbiota in the ldt.

TI  == effect of an essential oil-containing antimicrobial mouthrinse on specific plaque bacteria in vivo.
AB  == aim: this study was conducted to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on levels of specific supra and subgingival bacteria in subjects with gingivitis. material and methods: fifteen subjects meeting entry criteria completed this randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study. subjects were required to have >or=1000 target organisms per millilitre in pooled samples from two subgingival sites. following sampling of supra and subgingival plaque, subjects began twice-daily rinsing for 14 days with either an essential oil-containing mouthrinse (cool mint listerine antiseptic) or a negative control. supra and subgingival plaque was again sampled on day 15, and the procedure repeated after a 1-week washout period with subjects using the alternate rinse. results: compared with the negative control, the essential oil mouthrinse produced significant reductions in supragingival plaque levels of veillonella sp., capnocytophaga sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, and total anaerobes ranging from 52.3 to 88.5% (p<0.001 except for veillonella, p=0.002); respective  reductions in subgingival plaque ranged from 54.1 to 69.1% (p<0.001). conclusions: rinsing with the essential oil mouthrinse can have an impact on the  subgingival plaque flora. this study provides additional evidence indicating that reduction in supragingival plaque can reduce levels of subgingival plaque.

TI  == digestive tract microbiota in healthy volunteers.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to standardize the methods of sample collection of mucus from the digestive tract and to determine the microbiota in healthy volunteers from brazil, collecting samples from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. methods: microbiota of selected healthy volunteers from the oral cavity (n=10), the esophagus (n=10), the upper digestive tract (n=20), and the lower digestive tract (n=24) were evaluated through distinct collection methods. collection methods took into account the different sites, using basic scraping and swabbing techniques, stimulated saliva from the oral cavity, irrigation-aspiration with sterile catheters especially designed for the esophagus, a probe especially designed for  upper digestive tract, and a special catheter for the lower digestive tract. results: (i) mixed microbiota were identified in the oral cavity, predominantly gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci; (ii) transitional flora mainly in the  esophagus; (iii) veillonella sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp in the stomach and duodenum; (iv) in the jejunum and upper ileum, we observed bacteroides sp, proteus sp, and staphylococcus sp, in addition to veillonella sp; (v) in the colon, the presence of "nonpathogenic" anaerobic bacteria veillonella  sp (average 10(5) ufc) indicates the existence of a low oxidation-reduction potential environment, which suggests the possibility of adoption of these bacteria as biological markers of total digestive tract health. conclusions: the  collection methods were efficient in obtaining adequate samples from each segment of the total digestive tract to reveal the normal microbiota. these procedures are safe and easily reproducible for microbiological studies.

TI  == changes in periodontal health status are associated with bacterial community shifts as assessed by quantitative 16s cloning and sequencing.
AB  == the gingival sulcus contains a complex ecosystem that includes many uncultivated  bacteria. understanding the dynamics of this ecosystem in transitions between health and disease is important in advancing our understanding of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis. the objective of this longitudinal study was to examine the stability of bacterial colonization in the gingival crevice and to explore the relationship between shifts in microbial composition and changes in periodontal health status using a comprehensive, quantitative, culture-independent approach. subgingival plaque samples and periodontal data were collected from 24 subjects over 2 years. baseline and 2-year plaque samples  were analyzed using quantitative ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing. ten subjects remained periodontally healthy over 2 years, the periodontal health of seven subjects worsened, and seven subjects showed clinical improvement. bacterial stability was greatest among healthy, clinically stable subjects and lowest for subjects whose periodontal status worsened (p = 0.01). higher numbers  of species lost or gained were also observed for subjects whose clinical status changed (p = 0.009). this provides evidence that a change in periodontal status is accompanied by shifts within the bacterial community. based on these data, measures of microbial stability may be useful in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. regarding individual species, increases in levels of the uncultivated  phylotype veillonella sp. oral clone x042, a gram-negative bacterium and the most common member of the subgingival bacterial community, were associated with periodontal health (p = 0.04), suggesting that this is an important beneficial species. filifactor alocis, a gram-positive anaerobe, was found at higher levels  in subjects with disease (p = 0.01).

TI  == association between the presence of bacterial 16s rna in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (sweden).
AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

AB  == only about one third of humans possess a microbiota capable of transforming the dietary isoflavone daidzein into equol. little is known about the dietary and physiological factors determining this ecological feature. in this study, the in  vitro metabolism of daidzein by faecal samples from four human individuals was investigated. one culture produced the metabolites dihydrodaidzein and o-desmethylangolensin, another produced dihydrodaidzein and equol. from the latter, a stable and transferable mixed culture transforming daidzein into equol  was obtained. molecular fingerprinting analysis (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) showed the presence of four bacterial species of which only the  first three strains could be brought into pure culture. these strains were identified as lactobacillus mucosae epi2, enterococcus faecium epi1 and finegoldia magna epi3, and did not produce equol in pure culture. the fourth species was tentatively identified as veillonella sp strain ep. it was found that hydrogen gas in particular, but also butyrate and propionate, which are all colonic fermentation products from poorly digestible carbohydrates, stimulated equol production by the mixed culture. however, when fructo-oligosaccharides were added, equol production was inhibited. furthermore, the equol-producing capacity  of the isolated culture was maintained upon its addition to a faecal culture originating from a non-equol-producing individual.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == intra-chromosomal heterogeneity between the four 16s rrna gene copies in the genus veillonella: implications for phylogeny and taxonomy.
AB  == among the seven species characterized within the genus veillonella, three (veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula and veillonella atypica) have so far been isolated from human flora and during infectious processes. sequencing and analysis of 16s rdna (rrs) has been described as the best method for identification of veillonella strains at the species level since phenotypic characteristics are unable to differentiate between species. rrs sequencing for the three species isolated from humans showed more than 98 % identity between them. four rrs copies were found in the reference strains and in all the clinical isolates studied. the sequences of each rrs were determined for the clinical strain adv 360.1, and they showed a relatively high level of heterogeneity (1.43  %). in the majority of cases, polymorphic positions corresponded to nucleotides allowing differentiation between the three species isolated from humans. moreover, variability observed between rrs copies was higher than that between 16s rdna sequences of v. parvula and v. dispar. phylogenetic analysis showed that polymorphism between rrs copies affected the position of strain adv 360.1 in the  tree. variable positions occurred in stems and loops belonging to variable and hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna secondary structure but did not change the  overall structure of the 16s rrna. pcr-rflp experiments performed on 27 clinical  isolates of veillonella sp. suggested that inter-rrs heterogeneity occurs widely  among the members of the genus veillonella: these results, together with the lack of phenotypic criteria for species differentiation, give preliminary arguments for unification of v. dispar and v. parvula.

TI  == post-caesarean septicaemia in kandang kerbau hospital, singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  == we reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in kandang kerbau hospital between 1st january 1993 to 31st december 1995. there were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. there were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases),  urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). one of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. there was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. we could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. the most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were acinetobacter baumanii (2), escherichia coli (1), klebsiella sp. (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (1), streptococcus group f (1), peptostreptococcus species and veillonella species (1). there was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful  recovery in all the cases.

TI  == response of selected poultry cecal probiotic bacteria and a primary poultry salmonella typhimurium isolate grown with or without glucose in liquid batch culture.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine whether fermentation by a cecal probiotic co-culture of an enterococcus sp. and veillonella sp. would inhibit the in vitro growth of a s. typhimurium poultry isolate. the growth rates of s. typhimurium and enterococcus were significantly reduced at ph 5. at the two ph levels, there was a significant (p < 0.001) increase at 24 h in colony forming units for each of the bacteria enumerated from the mixed culture compared to the  respective pure culture enumerations. s. typhimurium was not inhibited in mixed cultures. the mixed cultures produced more acetate than any of the pure cultures  and lactate produced by enterococcus appeared to be utilized by veillonella.

TI  == ecological effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on defined mixed cultures of oral species grown in continuous culture.
AB  == the effects of triclosan and its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate were studied using a continuous culture microcosm model. two conditions were simulated, a caries-like state (ph 5.5 with artificial saliva plus glucose as growth medium) and a periodontal disease-like state (ph 7.5 with  bhi plus yeast extract, haemin and cysteine as growth medium). both cultures were maintained anaerobically at 37 degrees c at a growth rate of 0.1/h. steady-state  chemostats were pulsed with triclosan or triclosan monophosphate (initial concentrations between 20 and 40 mg/l) and changes in the ecological composition  noted after 6 h. the caries-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, lactobacillus and veillonella sp. with low but detectable levels of neisseria, actinomyces and fusobacterium sp. no significant ecological shifts occurred following pulses of either antimicrobial agent; all species were affected to approximately the same degree. the periodontal disease-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, fusobacterium, veillonella, actinomyces, prevotella and porphyromonas sp. with low numbers of neisseria and lactobacillus sp. significant ecological shifts were apparent following pulses of triclosan. the streptococci became the dominant group followed by fusobacterium sp. for triclosan monophosphate, the streptococci again became dominant although  lactobacillus and actinomyces were now the main sub-dominant species and gram-negative anaerobes including fusobacterium sp. were markedly inhibited. it is concluded that in the periodontal disease state, both triclosan and triclosan  monophosphate affected the gram-negative anaerobes to a greater extent than the gram-positive groups and that this effect was more marked for triclosan monophosphate.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

AB  == a 9 year-old boy and a 7 year-old girl suffered from fever and chest pains before they were brought to chang gung children's hospital. chest radiographs and computed tomography scans showed lung abscesses with pleural attachment, and using echo-guidance, percutaneous aspirations were done which confirmed the growth of fusobacterium sp, and veillonella parvula respectively, both of which are susceptible to penicillin g. the fever and chest pains subsided within 24 hours after the procedure. we suggest using early percutaneous aspiration of peripheral located lung abscesses soon after admission, rather than after a 10-14 day trial of antibiotic therapy: it can be a safe and cost-effective procedure to shorten the duration of the parenteral antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.

TI  == effect of an antiseptic mouthrinse on salivary microbiota.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the effect of rinsing with original formulation listerine antiseptic (la) on the level of viable salivary bacteria for periods up to 1 hour. materials and methods: in this double-blind, controlled, cross-over study,  unstimulated saliva was collected from 25 subjects, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. streptococci, veillonella sp., and total aerobic and anaerobic flora  were enumerated just prior to and 2, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after rinsing for 30  seconds with either 20 ml of la or a 5% hydroalcohol control rinse. results: after the control rinse, total flora cultivated on mm10 agar exhibited a non-significant (p > 0.05) 10%-20% decrease relative to baseline. in contrast, rinsing with la resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) 60%-65% decrease from baseline in all four microbial groups at 2 minutes; except in the case of veillonella, the significant decreases were sustained up to 60 minutes. total listerine group aerobic, anaerobic and streptococcal counts were significantly lower than placebo (p < 0.05). the significant reduction in salivary bacterial levels seen in the listerine group for up to 60 minutes suggests that this antiseptic mouthrinse may have use clinically as a pre-procedural rinse to decrease the level of viable microorganisms in aerosols generated during dental procedures.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == [roxithromycin in dental infections].
AB  == roxithromicin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, with similar antibacterial activity to erythromycin. it is characterized by an excellent pharmacokinetic profile and a good tissue penetration. particularly at the dose of 300 mg per day the dental tissue diffusion is extremely good, and this is important to oppose the oral cavity infections. oral cavity infections can be either odontogenic or non odontogenic. odontogenic infections are typically primary and are caused by commensal bacteria (oral streptococci, bacteroides sp., veillonella sp. and fusobacterium sp.). the antibacterial spectrum of roxithromycin is very large and includes many of the most frequent strains responsible for oral cavity infections. a very interesting characteristic of roxithromycin is its penetration in macrophages (uptake) that allow a more rapid inhibition of bacterial activity. to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of roxithromycin in the treatment of odontogenic infections, an open study was performed. this study evaluated both the microbiological and clinical aspects. thirty patients (21 females and 9 males) who had not been previously treated with antibiotic or antibacterial drugs, affected by infective dysodontiasis, gingivitis and periodontal diseases,  received 300 mg per day (once a day) of roxithromycin for an average period of 6  days. the symptomatology considered was: intumescence, redness, pain, lymphangitis and presence of trismus. clinical symptomatology was assessed at the start and at the end of the treatment. the symptomatological improvement due to roxithromycin was rapid and very effective. after 6 days of therapy, the improvement was statistically significant (p < 0.01) compared to basal conditions. no adverse reactions or side-effects were complained during the study. no changement were detected in laboratory parameters.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of granulocytopenia on oral microbial relationships in patients with acute leukemia.
AB  == risk for acute infection increases as granulocyte levels decrease secondary to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (anll). acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can  result in systemic infections in these patients. however, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with anll are not well understood.  twenty-one adult patients with anll with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). all specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). levels of total yeast also correlated positively with pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). significant correlations of levels of veillonella sp. with neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy. these data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria occur in plaque simultaneous with granulocytopenia in these patients. multiple mechanisms, including intergeneric coaggregation and other symbiotic relationships, may influence infectivity of the mixed plaque flora and thus contribute to the oral ecology observed in these patients.

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == comparison of the antimicrobial capability of an abrasive paste and chemical-soak denture cleaners.
AB  == the objective of this research was to compare the ability of the two most popular methods for denture cleaning to remove plaque microorganisms from dentures. dentu-creme abrasive denture paste and efferdent alkaline peroxide denture-cleanser soak were selected for study. two trials were completed in which these materials were used alone and in combination along with a no-treatment control to determine the level of recoverable plaque bacteria from removable dentures. plaque was allowed to accumulate for 48 or 72 hours in individuals with healthy oral mucosa during which time they refrained from all denture hygiene procedures. the results of two studies following similar double-blind cross-over  designs were consistent in that soaking with the denture cleanser caused a significantly greater reduction of microorganisms than did brushing with the denture paste. further, combining brushing with the soak did not reduce the level of recoverable microorganisms significantly more than soaking alone. overall, brushing alone did not consistently remove more microorganisms than were observed in the no-treatment group. the denture-cleanser soak displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-negative anaerobic rods (fusobacterium sp.),  gram-positive facultative cocci (streptococci), and gram-negative anaerobic cocci (veillonella sp.), as well as total recoverable microorganisms, which were all equally reduced by the denture-cleanser treatment. these results support the need for use of a denture cleanser in addition to brushing with a denture paste for proper denture hygiene.

AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == the association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.

AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml]. in 25%  of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the microorganisms isolated most frequently were: streptococcus, sp. ("viridans group"), veillonella parvula, hemophilus parainfluenzae, lactobacillus, sp., corynebacterium, sp., actinomyces, sp., bacteroides, sp., and hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. the upper range for the  number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == bacteriological study in chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the bacterial findings of 73 maxillary sinuses in 48 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, together with 7 non-inflamed sinuses, are reported. employing an intraoperative technique and simultaneous collection of 3 different  types of specimens in the present investigation made possible comparison of their bacterial characteristics. the results indicated that intraoperative culture of antral mucosa seems to provide the most reliable finding of bacterial flora in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the anaerobic bacteria were never found in the mucosal culture of non-inflamed sinus. the anaerobes appeared to invade the sinus cavity following the sealing of the ostium through the lymphatic or venous system and maintain the inflammatory process. microbiological analysis of the results between the infected and non-inflamed sinuses established anaerobic bacteria as the most important pathogen in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the predominant anaerobes recovered in descending order of frequency were veillonella sp., peptococcus sp., propionibacterium acne and anaerobic nonspore-forming gpb. statistical analysis of the results of mucosal culture of inflamed and control materials demonstrated that those aerobic and faculatative bacteria recovered in  the inflamed sinus appeared to be the normal inhabitants of non-inflamed sinus mucosa. the presence of normal flora in the normal healthy sinus mucosa may explain the chain of events that follows the occlusion of the ostium. these aerobic bacteria may become pathogenic and play a role in the pathogenesis of sinusitis.

TI  == transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == six transtracheal aspirations (tta) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria  and tta aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. differences in bacteria isolated in tta and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. six isolates  were recovered in both sites (three pseudomonas aeruginosa, two staphylococcus aureus and one aspergillus flavus). five aerobic isolates were recovered only in  the expectorated sputum and not in tta aspirations (two klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). nine organisms were isolated only from the tta (two each of veillonella parvula and alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, lactobacillus sp., haemophilus influenzae and gamma hemolytic streptococci). the recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six tta specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. we found tta to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == rapid method that aids in distinguishing gram-positive from gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several species of anaerobic bacteria display variable gram stain reactions which often make identification difficult. a simple, rapid method utilizing a 3% solution of potassium hydroxide to distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial was tested on 213 strains of anaerobic bacteria representing 19 genera. the gram stain reaction and koh test results were compared with the antibiotic disk susceptibilities (vancomycin and colistin) the  preliminary grouping of anaerobic bacteria. all three procedures were in agreement for the majority of strains examined. some strains of clostridia, eubacteria, and bifidobacteria stained gram negative or gram variable; the koh and antibiotic disk susceptibility tests correctly classified these strains as gram-positive. the koh test incorrectly grouped some strains of bacteroides sp.,  fusobacterium sp., leptotrichia buccalis, and veillonella parvula, but all gram stain results for these strains were consistent for gram-negative bacteria. the koh test is a useful supplement to the gram stain and antibiotic disk susceptibility testing for the initial classification of anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

(5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == numerical data concerning the sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.
AB  == upon comparison of results obtained from growing eight different species of anaerobic bacteria in deep agar under two and three atm of pure oxygen with results of growing them in air under atomospheric pressure, it appears possible that the old terms of "microaerophobic," "very strict anaerobe," and "microaerophilic" can be replaced by precise values corresponding to the size of  the inhibition zone produced by oxygen under various pressures when the bacteria  are grown in a solid medium. the simultaneous effect of the dilution of the inoculum and the pressure of oxygen used was determined with the help of an electronic computer according to the standard multiple regression method. two indices have been worked out which express the sensitivity of the species at different oxygen pressures when varying numbers of anaerobic bacteria are used: x sp, which is the size in millimeters of the inhibition zone when 1:10 dilutions of the culture are grown under pure oxygen at atmospheric pressure (lp=0), and b  sp, which is the result of multiplying by 1.43 the difference in size of inhibition zone when 1:10 dilutions of the culture are grown under atmospheric air (lp = -0.7) and under pure oxygen at 1 atm absolute.
