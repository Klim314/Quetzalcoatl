TI  - Antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. It is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and beta-carotene. This study was undertaken to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. The obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter sp, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumonia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). RESULTS: The methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. Whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against S. typhi, S. epidermidis, C. freundii and K. pneumonia. The results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. Moreover, the result indicates the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the ovary extract of D. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  - The biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. This method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. The main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. Tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. This purifier is called biofilter. The biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. In order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. Pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. According to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. When acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. The species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. Bacillus (B. cereus, B. subtilis), Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa, P. putida), Stapylococcus (S. aureus) and Rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. Their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 CFU g-1.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Streptomyces polymachus sp. nov. isolated from soil.
AB  - Strain T258T was isolated from the forest soil at Bongnae Falls, South Korea. The strain exhibited antimicrobial and antifungal activity against the following strains: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paenibacillus larvae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Growth occurred on all tested ISP media (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), Czapek-Dox agar, potato dextrose agar, trypticase soy agar, Bennett's modified agar, and nutrient agar at 28 degrees C. Aerial spores were produced solely on ISP Medium 4; the colour of the aerial mycelia were white and the substrate mycelia were ivory. Melanin production was negative on peptone-yeast extract iron agar (ISP Medium 6). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, and glycine. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained glucose, ribose, and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) while the minor menaquinone was MK-10(H2). The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were C16:0 (29.8 %), summed feature 3 (C16:1omega7c and/or C16:1omega6c) (15.1 %), anteiso-C15:0 (13.5 %), and iso-C15:0 (10.3 %). DNA-DNA similarity with other strains ranged between 37.84 +/- 1.15 % to 50.25 +/- 1.91 %. Based on these data, we suggest that strain T258T is a novel species that belong to the genus Streptomyces, for which we propose a name Streptomyces polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T258T (=KACC 18247T=KEMB 9005-212T=NBRC 110905T).
TI  - [Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra Oaxaca, Mexico].
AB  - Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra  Oaxaca, Mexico. Bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. They have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. To contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. For this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from February to October 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. Each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees C. Bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and biochemical tests. We obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. We found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum Proteobacteria and the family Enterobacteriaceae. Statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. It was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with Bacillus cereus, B. sp. X. sp., as well as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. Bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. These bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. By understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.
TI  - Bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  - A new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. This system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. The method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils than are traditional methods. Such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. A bacterial strain, T515(T), was isolated using this modified culture method. Growth of strain T515(T) occurred at pH 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl on R2A agar. Colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees C. Comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain T515(T) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus Bacillus, and strain T515(T) was most closely related to Bacillus panaciterrae Gsoil 1517(T) (96.7 %) and Bacillus funiculus NAF001(T) (96.0 %). The major quinone of strain T515(T) was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (23.2 %) and C16 : 0 (10.9 %). The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Strain T515(T) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). The strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: Bacillus subtilis KEMB 51201-001, Staphylococcus aureus KEMB 4659, Pseudomonas aeruginosa KACC 10185, Staphylococcus epidermidis KACC 13234, Paenibacillus larvae KACC 14031 and Escherichia coli KEMB 212-234. Based on these results, strain T515(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus with the proposed name, Bacillus polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T515(T) ( = KEMB 9005-168(T) = KACC 18242(T) = NBRC 110614(T)).
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the Mooi River, North West province, South Africa.
AB  - Groundwater in the Mooi River catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. In this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. Physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. HPC bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. E. coli were enumerated from Trimpark, School and Cemetery. The Blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. Pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. Opportunistic pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium spp. Varying patterns of antibiotic resistance were observed. Most HPC bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. Pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant ARB. Other ARBs included Alcaligenes faecalis, Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. ARBs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to HPCs. The presence of E. coli and ARB in these groundwater sources indicates potential human health risks. These risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.
TI  - The analysis of distribution of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas and Bacillus species from burn patients and burn ward environment.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria act as a risk factor for mortality in burns patients. So keeping in view the crucial importance of reliable therapeutic decisions of multidrug resistance bacteria and role of hospital environment in bacteria colonization, our study is based on the evaluation of distribution of Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. in burn patients and burn ward environment. METHODS: The present prospective analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the Burn ward of Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2012 to March 2013. The multidrug resistant bacteria were characterized by following the CLSI guidelines. Molecular identification isolates were done by amplifying and sequencing 16S rDNA. RESULTS: In our study out of 510 samples of 280 burn patients, 263 samples were observed sterile and bacterial isolates were obtained from 247 samples. In burn patients out of 247 samples 43 MDR strains, and in burn ward out of 60 samples 4 MDR strain were observed. After 16S rDNA amplification of MDR isolates the prevalent bacterium was belonged to the genus Bacillus (8 species; 26 isolates) followed by genus Pseudomonas (5 species; 17 isolates). The burn ward environment isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacillus cereus and Acinetobacter baumanii. CONCLUSION: The major finding of our study is the predominance of B. cereus followed by P. aeruginosa in burn patients of Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana. While considering the role of hospital environment, no direct role of environmental isolates was observed in transfer of bacterial infection.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Chemotaxis-based endosulfan biotransformation: enrichment and isolation of endosulfan-degrading bacteria.
AB  - The study was conducted to isolate endosulfan biotransforming or biodegrading microbes based on chemotaxis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain KKc3, Ochrobactrum sp. strain KKc4, Achromobacter xylosoxidans strain KKc6 and Bacillus megaterium KKc7 were isolated based on their migration towards endosulfan in a soil column. Out of the four bacteria, B. megaterium converted endosulfan into toxic metabolite endosulfan sulphate, while the other three bacteria followed the non-toxic endosulfan diol pathway. The mixed culture system consisting of P. aeruginosa, Ochrobactrum sp and A. xylosoxidans could remove 94% of total endosulfan by using endosulfan as the sole source of sulphur.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of biosurfactant producing coral associated bacteria isolated from gulf of mannar.
AB  - Coral Associated Bacteria (CAB) (N = 22) isolated from the mucus of the coral Acropora digitifera were screened for biosurfactants using classical screening methods; hemolysis test, lipase production, oil displacement, drop collapse test and emulsifying activity. Six CAB (U7, U9, U10, U13, U14, and U16) were found to produce biosurfactants and were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing as Providencia rettgeri, Psychrobacter sp., Bacillus flexus, Bacillus anthracis, Psychrobacter sp., and Bacillus pumilus respectively. Their cell surface hydrophobicity was determined by Microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon assay and the biosurfactants produced were extracted and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Since the biosurfactants are known for their surface modifying capabilities, antibiofilm activity of positive isolates was evaluated against biofilm forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC10145. Stability of the active principle exhibiting antibiofilm activity was tested through various temperature treatments ranging from 60 to 100 degrees C and Proteinase K treatment. CAB isolates U7 and U9 exhibited stable antibiofilm activity even after exposure to higher temperatures which is promising for the development of novel antifouling agents for diverse industrial applications. Further, this is the first report on biosurfactant production by a coral symbiont.
TI  - Wollamides: antimycobacterial cyclic hexapeptides from an Australian soil Streptomyces.
AB  - A soil Streptomyces nov. sp. (MST-115088) isolated from semiarid terrain near Wollogorang Station, Queensland, returned two known and two new examples of a rare class of cyclic hexapeptide, desotamides A and B (1 and 2) and E and F (3 and 4), respectively, together with two new d-Orn homologues, wollamides A and B (5 and 6). Structures were assigned by detailed spectroscopic and C3 Marfey's analysis. The desotamides/wollamides exhibit growth inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria (IC50 0.6-7 muM) and are noncytotoxic to mammalian cells (IC50 >30 muM). The wollamides exhibit antimycobacterial activity (IC50 2.8 and 3.1 muM), including reduction in the intracellular mycobacterial survival in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.
TI  - Two rhizobacterial strains, individually and in interactions with Rhizobium sp.,  enhance fusarial wilt control, growth, and yield in pigeon pea.
AB  - A Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, RRLJ 04, and a Bacillus cereus strain, BS 03, were tested both individually and in combination with a Rhizobium strain, RH 2, for their ability to enhance plant growth and nodulation in pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) under gnotobiotic, greenhouse and field conditions. Both of the rhizobacterial strains exhibited a positive effect on growth in terms of shoot height, root length, fresh and dry weight, nodulation and yield over the non-treated control. Co-inoculation of seeds with these strains and Rhizobium RH 2 also reduced the number of wilted plants, when grown in soil infested with Fusarium udum. Gnotobiotic studies confirmed that the suppression of wilt disease was due to the presence of the respective PGPR strains. Seed bacterization with drug-marked mutants of RRLJ 04 and BS 03 confirmed their ability to colonize and multiply along the roots. The results suggest that co-inoculation of these strains with Rhizobium strain RH 2 can be further exploited for enhanced growth, nodulation and yield in addition to control of fusarial wilt in pigeon pea.
TI  - Purification and molecular and biological characterisation of the 1-hydroxyphenazine, produced by an environmental strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa--an opportunistic pathogen, perhaps best known for chronic lung infections, produces wide range of pigments that possess specific activities which either assist the organism's survival or bring about changes within host. A similar blue-green diffusible pigment producing P. aeruginosa was isolated from dug-well water, so as to extract 1-hydroxyphenazine from its crude pigment. The compound was purified from the crude pigment using column chromatography followed by a preparative thin layer chromatography that showed a single yellow spot. Further molecular characterisation of the purified component was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy which showed respective peaks corresponding to 1-hydroxyphenazine. Biological characterisation using in vitro assays revealed that 1-hydroxyphenazine showed anti-bacterial activity only against Bacillus sp. and a concentration of 30 microg/ml induced noticeable morphological alteration in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells followed by cell death after 48 h. Thus, such active components within bacterial pigments can be characterized and used as possible anti-bacterial or anti-cancer agents.
TI  - Anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. Thirty strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (Kerman, Iran). Quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of S. aureus, 13% of P. aeruginosa and 17% of P. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the purified Se NPs (produced by Bacillus sp. MSh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. Obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. Effect of temperature and pH on the biofilm formation in the presence of Se NPs and SeO2 was also evaluated.
TI  - The blow fly, Chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, Musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in Northeast Thailand.
AB  - The Oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and the house fly, Musca domestica L., (Diptera: Muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. There were two main aims of this study. The first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and paddy fields, in the Muang Ubon Ratchathani and Warinchamrap districts of Ubon Ratchathani province of Northeast Thailand. Flies collection were conducted monthly from September 2010-October 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. A total of 7 750 flies (6 401 C. megacephala and 1 349 M.domestica) were collected. The second aim was to examine the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. Bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 C. megacephala and 439 M. domestica). A total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Streptococcus group D non-enterococci. Human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus sp., and Enterococcus sp., of which S. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. Other human pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Not only were the number of C. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for M. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than M. domestica. These data suggest that both fly species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens associated with human habitations year-round in this region of Northeast Thailand.
TI  - Composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some Acinos Miller species.
AB  - GC and GC/MS analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six Acinos Miller species from Serbia and Montenegro were performed. Seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. The common feature of the A. suaveolens, A. majoranifolius and A. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the A. graveolens, A. arvensis and A. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. The total flavonoids, polyphenols and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of A. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. A disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium pyogenes, Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus flavus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli; fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of A. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - In-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. The essential oil of the Thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. This essential oil may also have an anticancer activity. METHODS: The essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by GC/MS analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by HPLC method. The essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial activity. RESULT: The Terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. In this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. The essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteridis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (MIC). All the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. These activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. HPLC confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. CONCLUSION: Methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. The technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using DPPH, ABTS and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. The present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.
TI  - Culturable Aerobic and Facultative Anaerobic Intestinal Bacterial Flora of Black  Cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) in Southern Pakistan.
AB  - Using morphological analysis and biochemical testing, here for the first time, we determined the culturable gut bacterial flora (aerobes and facultative anaerobes) in the venomous Black Cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) from South Asia. The findings revealed that these snakes inhabit potentially pathogenic bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella sp., Moraxella sp., Bacillus sp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, and Providencia rettgeri. These findings are of concern, as injury from snake bite can result in wound infections and tissue necrosis leading to sepsis/necrotizing fasciitis and/or expose consumers of snake meat/medicine in the community to infections.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activity of Haliclona sp. from the Persian Gulf, Iran.
AB  - In this study, antifungal and antibacterial activities of diethyl ether, methanol and aqueous extracts of Haliclona sp. were assessed (in vitro). The antibacterial activity of the extracts was determined by broth dilution methods against clinical Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus aureus, Bacillus subtilis spizizenii. The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by using a broth microdilution test against clinical fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Our results showed diethyl ether extract of Haliclona sp. was active on Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, methanol extract in comparison with diethyl ether extract had better activity against C. albicans (MIC: 0.75 mg/mL, MFC: 1.5mg/mL) and A. fumigatus (MIC: 2mg/mL, MFC: 3mg/mL). Aqueous extract had neither antifungal nor antibacterial activities. Based our results, Haliclona sp. can be considered as a source of novel antibiotic and antifungal.
TI  - [Epidemiological investigation in five dental offices of the Clinic of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc and of the Olomouc University Hospital].
AB  - The aim of this epidemiological investigation was to determine microbial contamination of surfaces, medical devices, and equipment in five outpatient dental offices of the Clinic of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc and of the Olomouc University Hospital. The epidemiological investigation was carried out as a one-time detection of microbial contamination from selected at risk sites on the dental unit with chair and in its immediate surroundings that had been sampled before the staff and patients arrived in the morning. The rates of culture-negative results ranged from 6.0 % in the children's dental office to 17.3 % in the dental prosthetics office. No statistically significant difference in these rates was found between different types of dental offices. The most commonly identified microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Bacillus sp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa often reported to be the cause of hospital infection was isolated from the spit-toon drain in most of the cases. No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the swabs. We believe that the microorganisms isolated from the at risk sites are indoor airborne pathogens initially present in aerosols and then deposited on surfaces during the time after working hours. KEYWORDS: dental office - bioaersol - contamination of surfaces - infectious agent.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  - Surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. The antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. A total of 39 Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as Vibrio sp. (48.72%), Alteromonas sp. (12.82%), Shewanella sp. (12.26%), Serratia sp. (2.56%), Citricoccus sp. (2.56%), Cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), Ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and Staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). Six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match, and some of those could be new. The highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against B. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (Shewanella sp.). Several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, mainly belonging to Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. There were no positive results against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.
AB  - In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.
TI  - Tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  - Binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. Hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. The present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. The results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. We hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. The alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. Bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. These findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.
TI  - Comparative pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial community change in biofilm formed on seawater reverse osmosis membrane.
AB  - The change in bacterial community structure induced by bacterial competition and  succession was investigated during seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) in order to elucidate a possible link between the bacterial consortium on SWRO membranes and biofouling. To date, there has been no definitive characterization of the microbial diversity in SWRO in terms of distinguishing time-dependent changes in the richness or abundance of bacterial species. For bacterial succession within biofilms on the membrane surface, SWRO using a cross-flow filtration membrane test unit was operated for 5 and 100h, respectively. As results of the pyrosequencing analysis, bacterial communities differed considerably among seawater and the 5 and 100 h samples. From a total of 33,876 pyrosequences (using a 95% sequence similarity), there were less than 1% of shared species, confirming the influence of the operational time factor and lack of similarity of these communities. During SWRO operation, the abundance of Pseudomonas stutzeri BBSPN3 (GU594474) belonging to gamma-Proteobacteria suggest that biofouling of SWRO membrane might be driven by the dominant influence of a specific species. In addition, among the bacterial competition of five bacterial species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus sp., Rhodobacter sp., Flavobacterium sp., and Mycobacterium sp.) competing for bacterial colonization on the SWRO membrane surfaces, it was exhibited that Bacillus sp. was the most dominant. The dominant influences ofPseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. on biofouling during actual SWRO is decisive depending on higher removal efficiency of the seawater pretreatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of some Euphorbia species.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts and latex of some Euphorbia species used for medical purposes in Turkey were investigated. The extracts of Euphorbia aleppica L., Euphorbia szovitsii Fisch.&Mey. var. harputensis Aznav. ex M. S. Khan, Euphorbia falcata L. sub. falcata var. falcata, Euphorbia denticulata Lam., Euphorbia macroclada Boiss., Euphorbia cheiradenia Boiss.&Hohen, Euphorbia virgata Waldst.&Kit., Euphorbia petiolata Banks&Sol. were prepared with methanol. The antimicrobial activities of these extracts were examined on test microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus COWAN 1, Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Klebsiella pneumonia FMC 5, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 50071, Candida albicans FMC 17, Candida glabrata ATCC 66032, Epidermophyton sp. and Trichophyton sp. by the disc diffusion methods and well agar method. The MIC values of extracts were determined according to the broth microdulitions method. Results indicated that extracts of Euphorbia species inhibited the growth of tested microorganisms in the different ratio. Also, the MIC values of extracts were determined as 31,2-1000 microg.
TI  - Paraben resistance in bacteria from sewage treatment plant effluents in India.
AB  - Parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. Generally, sewage treatment plants (STPs) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. In this study, bacteria in STP effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. The susceptibility was in the order of Staphylococcus aureus > Bacillus sp. >Escherichia coli > Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control and Gram-positive bacteria. Further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. Interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >/=5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. The increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. This is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of Indian STPs. Paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. Thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.
TI  - Structure and activity of lobophorins from a turrid mollusk-associated Streptomyces sp.
AB  - A novel lumun-lumun sampling methodology was used to obtain a large diversity of  micromollusks, including the new species Lienardia totopotens. In turn, from L. totopotens we cultivated a Streptomyces sp. strain that contained new and known spirotetronate polyketides, lobophorins (1-5). The structures were elucidated using spectroscopy, and the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity to human cells and activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. Compounds 2-5 showed varying degrees of activity against human cells, M. tuberculosis and B. subtilis in the low muM to mid nM range but were inactive against the other strains, while 1 lacking digitoxose was inactive. Very slight structural changes in 2-5 led to varying antibacterial:cytotoxicity ratios, providing a possible basis to synthesize more selective derivatives.
TI  - Chemical constituents of Aspergillus sp EJC08 isolated as endophyte from Bauhinia guianensis and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The present work reports the isolation of five compounds from Aspergillus sp EJC08 isolated as endophytic from Bauhinia guianensis, a tipical plant of the Amazon. The compounds ergosterol (1), ergosterol peroxide (2), mevalolactone (3), monomethylsulochrin (4) and trypacidin A (5) were isolated by chromatographic procedures and identified by spectral methods of 1D and 2D NMR and MS. Compounds 3, 4 and 5 were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and showed good activity.
TI  - Harvestman phenols and benzoquinones: characterisation and biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - Benzoquinones are usually present in arthropod defence exudates. Here, we describe the chemical profiles of 12 harvestman species belonging to the neotropical family Gonyleptidae. Nine of the studied species produced benzoquinones, while three produced alkyl phenols. Two benzoquinones and one phenol exhibited biological activity against bacteria and fungi. We also studied the biosynthesis of 2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone by feeding Magnispina neptunus individuals with (1)(3)C-labelled precursors; the benzoquinones were biosynthesised through a polyketide pathway using acetate and propionate building blocks.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activity of marine bacteria associated with the soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum.
AB  - Coral reefs are the most biodiverse and biologically productive of all marine ecosystems. Corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic groups. However, little is known about the diversity of coral-associated microorganisms. We used molecular techniques to identify and compare the culturable bacterial assemblages associated with the soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum from the Red sea. Different media were utilized for microbial isolation, and the phylogeny of the culturable bacteria associated with the coral was analyzed based on 16S rDNA sequencing. The coral associated bacteria were found to be representatives within the Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Antimicrobial activities of twenty bacterial isolates were tested against four pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio fluvialis) and three fungi (Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans). A relatively high proportion of bacterial strains displayed distinct antibacterial and antifungal activities, suggesting that soft coral-associated microorganisms may aid their host in protection against marine pathogens. Members of genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas had the highest proportion of antimicrobial activity which supported the hypothesis that they might play a protective role in the coral hosts.
TI  - [Lectin-binding analysis of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix carbohydrate composition of corrosion-aggressive bacteria].
AB  - The carbohydrate components of biofilms of corrosion-aggressive bacteria were studied by transmisstion electron microscopy using lectins labeled with colloidal gold. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and neutral carbohydrates D-glucose and D-mannose were found within the exopolymeric matrix. Lectins with equal carbohydrate specificity demonstrated different degrees of interaction with the carbohydrate components of bacterial biofilms. To identify N-acetyl-D-galactosamine in biofilms of Desulfovibrio sp. 10 and Bacillus subtilis 36, the LBA lectin appeared to be most specific; in the case of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in biofilms of B. subtilis 36 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27, the WGA lectin. During visualization of neutral carbohydrates in the studied cultures, the PSA lectin was most specific. We have shown that lectins labeled with colloidal gold could be used as an express method for the identification and localization of carbohydrates in glycopolymers of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix.

TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Optimization of media and temperature for enhanced antimicrobial production by bacteria associated with Rhabditis sp.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Entomopathogenic nematodes, belonging to the family heterorhabditis and steinernematidae, are reported to be symbiotically associated with specific bacteria and the secondary metabolites produced by these bacteria possess antimicrobial activity. In this study, bacteria were isolated from nematodes belonging to the family rhabditidae, and the antimicrobial activity was tested against four bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2756, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 902, Escherichia coli MTCC 2622, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 2642 and five fungi viz. Aspergillus flavus MTCC 183, Candida albicans MTCC 277, Fusarium oxysporum MTCC 284, Rhizoctonia solani MTCC 4634 and Penicillium expansum MTCC 2006. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolated bacteria were cultured in nutrient broth (NB), Luria broth (LB) and Tryptic soya broth (TSB) at 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Cell free culture filtrate was prepared by centrifugation and was separated into organic and aqueous fractions. Organic fraction was concentrated and tested for antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: The culture filtrate of the bacteria isolated from the entomopathogenic Rhabditis sp. was found to possess antimicrobial activity against the four bacteria and five fungi tested. The bacterium grew well in TSB, LB and NB media though in TSB yield and activity were higher. Antimicrobial activity was higher at 30 degrees C as compared with 25 or 35 degrees C. HPLC analysis indicated major differences in peak areas and retention times at different temperatures. Increased number of peaks with higher peak areas was obtained at 30 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the bacteria could produce more bioactive molecules effective against medically and agriculturally important bacteria and fungi depending on culture media and temperature. Modified media could yield different types of molecules effective against diseases/disorders of plant, animals and humans.
TI  - Changing profile of organisms causing scleral buckle infections: a clinico-microbiological case series.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbiological spectrum and in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from explanted scleral buckles and to correlate clinical presentation to the causative agent. METHOD: Medical records of patients who underwent buckle explantation from July 2007 to May 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical features and microbiological profile were noted and correlated. RESULTS: Twenty of 24 buckles (83.33%) from 24 patients grew 21 isolates. Isolates included 6 acid-fast bacilli (28.57%; atypical mycobacteria = 5, Nocardia asteroides = 1), 5 gram-positive bacilli (23.8%; Corynebacterium spp. = 4, Bacillus sp. = 1), 4 gram-positive cocci (19.0%; Staphylococcus spp. = 4), 2 gram-negative bacilli (9.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa = 2), and 4 fungi (19.0%; Aspergillus spp. = 3, Paecilomyces sp. = 1). Acid-fast bacilli and gram-negative bacilli were sensitive to amikacin and gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive cocci to vancomycin. Buckle exposure within 2 years of primary surgery tended to be noninfective (P = 0.06). Fungal or mycobacterial infections were more symptomatic than those with Corynebacterium species. Results of microscopic examination of conjunctival swab in 5 of 7 eyes (71.4%) were consistent with culture of conjunctival swab and explanted buckles. CONCLUSION: Clinical features and microscopic examination of conjunctival swab may give a lead toward the causative organism in suspected buckle infections. Based on these leads, vancomycin and amikacin may be used as the initial empirical therapy.
TI  - Cytotoxic (A549) and antimicrobial effects of Methylobacterium sp. isolate (ERI-135) from Nilgiris forest soil, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Methylobacterium  sp. isolated from soil sample of Doddabetta forest, Nilgiris, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Isolation of Methylobacterium was performed from soils by serial dilution plate technique. The strain was grown in modified nutrient gulucose agar (MNGA) medium to study the morphology and biochemical characteristics. Methylobacterium sp. was screened for its antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The strain was subjected to 16S rRNA analysis and was identified as Methylobacterium sp. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate exhibited close similarity with other Methylobacterium sp. and has been submitted to Genbank. The antibacterial substances were extracted using chloroform and ethyl acetate from MNGA medium in which ERI-135 had grown for 5 d at 30 degrees C. Cytotoxic effect was also studied. GC-MS analysis was carried out. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro dilution technique. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate extract showed activity against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureu and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and fungi such as, Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were: 250 microg/mL against S. epidermidis and 250microg/mL against K. pneumonia. The isolate had the ability to produce enzymes such as protease. The exyract showed cytotoxic effect in human adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of isovaleric acid (3.64%), 2-Methylbutanoic acid (5.03%), isobutyramide (5.05%), N,N-oimethylformamide-di-t-butylacetal (9.79%), benzeneacetamide (15.56%), octyl butyl phthalate (3.59%) and diisooctyl phthalate (5.79) in the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Methylobacterium sp. (ERI-135) showed promising antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. This is the first report in the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Methylobacterium sp.
TI  - Biological activities of selected basidiomycetes from Yemen.
AB  - In a previous paper we demonstrated the results of biological screening of Yemeni basidiomycetes. The present study was aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and the antioxidant activity of further basidiomycetes collected in Yemen. Dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of the fruiting bodies of 25 species were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activities against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), against six human fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Aspergillus fumigatus, Mucor sp., Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes) and against one non human pathogenic fungus (Candida maltosa). The results indicated that 75 extracts exhibited activity against one or more of the bacteria. The methanol extracts of Agaricus cf. bernardii, Agrocybe pediades, Chlorophyllum molybdites, Coriolopsis polyzona, Ganoderma xylonoides, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Trametes lactinea and Trametes cingulata showed activity against all tested bacteria. The highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by methanol extracts from Chlorophyllum molybdites, Ganoderma xylonoides and Trametes cingulata and Agaricus cf. bernardii, Agrocybe pediades, Coriolopsis polyzona, Pycnoporus sanguineus and Trametes lactinea. The methanol extracts of Chlorophyllum molybdites, Ganoderma xylonoides and Pycnoporus sanguineus showed considerable antifungal activities against the tested fungal strains. Strong antioxidative effects employing the DPPH assay were exhibited by methanol extracts from Chlorophyllum molybdites, Ganoderma xylonoides, Hexagonia velutina, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Trametes lactinea and Trametes cingulata. Our previous and presented studies about 48 basidiomycetes collected in Yemen provide evidence that basidiomycetes from the Arabic region so far should attract more attention as potential source for new biologically active agents.
TI  - Comparative Molecular docking analysis of DNA Gyrase subunit A in Pseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterium known for causing chronic infections in cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Recently, several drug targets in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 have been reported using network biology approaches on the basis of essentiality and topology and further ranked on network measures viz. degree and centrality. Till date no drug/ligand molecule has been reported against this targets.In our work we have identified the ligand /drug molecules, through Orthologous gene mapping against Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 and performed modelling and docking analysis. From the predicted drug targets in PA PAO1, we selected those drug targets which show statistically significant orthology with a model organism and whose orthologs are present in all the selected drug targets of PA PAO1.Modeling of their structure has been done using I-Tasser web server. Orthologous gene mapping has been performed using Cluster of Orthologs (COGs) and based on orthology; drugs available for Bacillus sp. have been docked with PA PAO1 protein drug targets using MoleGro virtual docker version 4.0.2.Orthologous gene for PA3168 gyrA is BS gyrAfound in Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. The drugs cited for Bacillus sp. have been docked with PA genes and energy analyses have been made. Based on Orthologous gene mapping andin-silico studies, Nalidixic acid is reported as an effective drug against PA3168 gyrA for the treatment of CF and COPD.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from Colombian biodiversity.
AB  - On a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. In this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical families (Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Solanaceae), collected at the Natural Regional Park Ucumari (Risaralda, Colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. The antibacterial activities were assayed against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and three Gram-negative ones named, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast Candida albicans and the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani. Overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. In general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the Rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the Euphorbiaceae and Solanaceae ones. It is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of Alchornea coelophylla (Euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (B. Subtilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli). Furthermore, the best Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from Acalypha diversifolia and Euphorbia sp (Euphorbiaceae). The most susceptible fungus evaluated was F. Solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus. The antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.
TI  - Association with soil bacteria enhances p38-dependent infection resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - The importance of our inner microbial communities for proper immune responses against invading pathogens is now well accepted, but the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate such mechanisms. Since very little is known about the microbes interacting with C. elegans in its natural environment, we began by taking the first steps to characterize the C. elegans microbiota. We established a natural-like environment in which initially germfree, wild-type larvae were grown on enriched soil. Bacterial members of the adult C. elegans microbiota were isolated by culture and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Using pure cultures of bacterial isolates as food, we identified two, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas mendocina, that enhanced resistance to a subsequent infection with the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whereas protection by B. megaterium was linked to impaired egg laying, corresponding to a known trade-off between fecundity and resistance, the mechanism underlying protection conferred by P. mendocina depended on weak induction of immune genes regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway. Disruption of the p38 ortholog, pmk-1, abolished protection. P. mendocina enhanced resistance to P. aeruginosa but not to the Gram-positive pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, protection from P. aeruginosa was similarly induced by a P. aeruginosa gacA mutant with attenuated virulence but not by a different C. elegans-associated Pseudomonas sp. isolate. Our results support a pivotal role for the conserved p38 pathway in microbiota-initiated immune protection and suggest that similarity between microbiota members and pathogens may play a role in such protection.
TI  - Actinopyga lecanora hydrolysates as natural antibacterial agents.
AB  - Actinopyga lecanora, a type of sea cucumber commonly known as stone fish with relatively high protein content, was explored as raw material for bioactive peptides production. Six proteolytic enzymes, namely alcalase, papain, pepsin, trypsin, bromelain and flavourzyme were used to hydrolyze A. lecanora at different times and their respective degrees of hydrolysis (DH) were calculated. Subsequently, antibacterial activity of the A. lecanora hydrolysates, against some common pathogenic Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas sp.) were evaluated. Papain hydrolysis showed the highest DH value (89.44%), followed by alcalase hydrolysis (83.35%). Bromelain hydrolysate after one and seven hours of hydrolysis exhibited the highest antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 51.85%, 30.07% and 30.45%, respectively compared to the other hydrolysates. Protein hydrolysate generated by papain after 8 h hydrolysis showed maximum antibacterial activity against S. aureus at 20.19%. The potent hydrolysates were further fractionated using RP-HPLC and antibacterial activity of the collected fractions from each hydrolysate were evaluated, wherein among them only three fractions from the bromelain hydrolysates exhibited inhibitory activities against Pseudomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli at 24%, 25.5% and 27.1%, respectively and one fraction of papain hydrolysate showed antibacterial activity of 33.1% against S. aureus. The evaluation of the relationship between DH and antibacterial activities of papain and bromelain hydrolysates revealed a meaningful correlation of four and six order functions.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of polyketide metabolite from marine Streptomyces sp. AP-123 and its cytotoxic effect.
AB  - A Gram positive, filamentous, spore forming antagonistic Streptomyces sp. AP-123  derived from marine region of Andra Pradesh, India, was studied for its medical importance. Among the 210 Streptomyces strains screened at 64.3% exhibited activity against Gram positive bacteria, 48.5% showed activity towards Gram negative bacteria, 38.8% exhibited both Gram positive and negative bacteria and 80.85% strains revealed significant antifungal activity. However, primary screening revealed that Streptomyces sp. AP-123 exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacteria compared to other Streptomyces strains. The presence of l-diaminopimelic acid and glycine in the cell wall hydrolysates and streptomycin resistance indicated the strain belonged to Streptomyces genus. The 16S rDNA gene based phylogenetic affiliation was determined by using bioinformatic tools and it was identified as Streptomyces sp. AP-123 with 99% sequence similarity to Streptomyces flavogriseus. The antimicrobial substances were extracted by hexane and ethyl acetate from spent medium in which Streptomyces sp. AP-123 was cultivated at 30 degrees C for 5 d. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro-dilution technique. A compound was obtained by eluting the crude extract using varying concentrations of solvents followed by the chromatographic purification. Based on the IR, (13)C NMR and (1)H NMR spectral data, the compound was identified as polyketide related antibiotic. It exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and also showed a potent cytotoxic activity against cell lines viz. Vero (Green monkey kidney) and HEP2 (laryngeal carcinoma cells) in vitro. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the compound against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were 25 and 37.5 mug mL(-1), respectively. Against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa it exhibited MIC of 50 and 37.58 mug mL(-1), respectively. However, against Candida albicans and filamentous fungus, Aspergillus niger the MIC values were 12.5 and 25 mug mL(-1), respectively. Cloning and sequence analysis of ketoacyl synthase (KS) gene revealed similarity to the type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene of Streptomyces species.
TI  - [Role of polymer complexes in the formation of biofilms by corrosive bacteria on  steel surfaces].
AB  - The composition of exopolymer complexes (EPCs), synthesized by the monocultures Desulfovibrio sp. 10, Bacillus subtilis 36, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 and by microbial associations involved in the corrosion of metal surfaces has been studied. An analysis of the monosaccharide composition of carbohydrate components, as well as the fatty acid composition of the lipid part of EPCs, was carried out by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). It was found that bacteria in biofilms synthesized polymers; this process was dominated by glucose, while the growth of bacteria in a suspension was marked by a high rhamnose content. Hexouronic acids and hexosamine have been revealed as a part of B. subtilis 36 and P. aeruginosa 27 EPCs. Qualitative differences were revealed in the fatty acid composition ofexopolymers in biofilms and in a bacterial suspension. It was shown that the transition to a biofilm form of growth led to an increase in the unsaturation degree of fatty acids in the exopolymers of associative cultures. The results can be used to develop methods to control microbial corrosion of metal surfaces.
TI  - Evaluation of guar gum derivatives as gelling agents for microbial culture media.
AB  - Guar gum, a galactomannan, has been reported to be an inexpensive substitute of agar for microbial culture media. However, its use is restricted probably because of (1) its highly viscous nature even at high temperatures, making dispensing of the media to Petri plates difficult and (2) lesser clarity of the guar gum gelled media than agar media due to impurities present in guar gum. To overcome these problems, three guar gum derivatives, carboxymethyl guar, carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar and hydroxypropyl guar, were tested as gelling agents for microbial growth and differentiation. These were also evaluated for their suitability for other routine microbiological methods, such as, enumeration, use of selective and differential media, and antibiotic sensitivity test. For evaluation purpose, growth and differentiation of eight fungi and eight bacteria grown on the media gelled with agar (1.5%), guar gum (4%) or one of the guar gum derivatives (4%), were compared. All fungi and bacteria exhibited normal growth and differentiation on all these media. Generally, growth of most of the fungi was better on guar gum derivatives gelled medium than on agar medium. The enumeration carried out for Serratia sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by serial dilution and pour plate method yielded similar counts in all the treatments. Likewise, the selective succinate medium, specific for P. aeruginosa, did not allow growth of co-inoculated Bacillus sp. even if gelled with guar gum derivatives. The differential medium, Congo red mannitol agar could not differentiate between Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhizobium meliloti on color basis, if gelled with guar gum or any of its derivatives However, for antibiotic sensitivity tests for both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, guar gum and its derivatives were as effective as agar.
TI  - Identification of antimicrobial compound, diketopiperazines, from a Bacillus sp.  N strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode against major plant pathogenic fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To purify and characterize antimicrobial compounds from Bacillus sp. strain N associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode (EPN). METHODS AND RESULTS: The cell-free culture filtrate of a bacterium associated with an EPN, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp., exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain three diketopiperazines (DKPs). The structure and absolute stereochemistry of this compound were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR, (1) H-(1) H COSY, (1) H-(13) C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr), respectively. Three DKPs were active against all the five fungi tested (Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Penicillium expansum) and are more effective than the standard fungicide bavistin. The highest activity of 4 mug ml(-1) by cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr) was recorded against P. expansum, a plant pathogen responsible for causing postharvest decay of stored apples and oranges. Cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) recorded good antibacterial activity against all the four bacteria tested (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr) recorded good activity only against Gram-positive bacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of the DKPs against the plant pathogenic fungi F. oxysporum, R. solani and P. expansum. The production of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro-l-Leu) and cyclo-(d-Pro-l-Tyr) by a bacterium associated with EPN is also reported here for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated DKPs demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, especially against plant pathogenic fungi. We conclude that the bacterium associated with EPN is a promising source of natural bioactive secondary metabolites which may receive great benefit in the field of agriculture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of compounds unique from EPN bacteria as potential sources of new drugs in the agricultural and pharmacological industry.
TI  - Siderophore-producing bacteria from a sand dune ecosystem and the effect of sodium benzoate on siderophore production by a potential isolate.
AB  - Bioremediation in natural ecosystems is dependent upon the availability of micronutrients and cofactors, of which iron is one of the essential elements. Under aerobic and alkaline conditions, iron oxidizes to Fe(+3) creating iron deficiency. To acquire this essential growth-limiting nutrient, bacteria produce low-molecular-weight, high-affinity iron chelators termed siderophores. In this study, siderophore-producing bacteria from rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere areas of coastal sand dunes were isolated using a culture-dependent approach and were assigned to 8 different genera with the predominance of Bacillus sp. Studies on the ability of these isolates to grow on sodium benzoate revealed that a pigmented bacterial culture TMR2.13 identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed growth on mineral salts medium (MSM) with 2% of sodium benzoate and produced a yellowish fluorescent siderophore identified as pyoverdine. This was inhibited above 54 muM of added iron in MSM with glucose without affecting growth, while, in presence of sodium benzoate, siderophore was produced even up to the presence of 108 muM of added iron. Increase in the requirement of iron for metabolism of aromatic compounds in ecosystems where the nutrient deficiencies occur naturally would be one of the regulating factors for the bioremediation process.
TI  - Mass spectral molecular networking of living microbial colonies.
AB  - Integrating the governing chemistry with the genomics and phenotypes of microbial colonies has been a "holy grail" in microbiology. This work describes a highly sensitive, broadly applicable, and cost-effective approach that allows metabolic profiling of live microbial colonies directly from a Petri dish without any sample preparation. Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS), combined with alignment of MS data and molecular networking, enabled monitoring of metabolite production from live microbial colonies from diverse bacterial genera, including Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work demonstrates that, by using these tools to visualize small molecular changes within bacterial interactions, insights can be gained into bacterial developmental processes as a result of the improved organization of MS/MS data. To validate this experimental platform, metabolic profiling was performed on Pseudomonas sp. SH-C52, which protects sugar beet plants from infections by specific soil-borne fungi [R. Mendes et al. (2011) Science 332:1097-1100]. The antifungal effect of strain SH-C52 was attributed to thanamycin, a predicted lipopeptide encoded by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster. Our technology, in combination with our recently developed peptidogenomics strategy, enabled the detection and partial characterization of thanamycin and showed that it is a monochlorinated lipopeptide that belongs to the syringomycin family of antifungal agents. In conclusion, the platform presented here provides a significant advancement in our ability to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite production in live microbial colonies and communities.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Iodine from bacterial iodide oxidization by Roseovarius spp. inhibits the growth  of other bacteria.
AB  - Microbial activities in brine, seawater, or estuarine mud are involved in iodine  cycle. To investigate the effects of the microbiologically induced iodine on other bacteria in the environment, a total of 13 bacteria that potentially participated in the iodide-oxidizing process were isolated from water or biofilm at a location containing 131 mug ml(-1) iodide. Three distinct strains were further identified as Roseovarius spp. based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences after being distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Morphological characteristics of these three Roseovarius spp. varied considerably across and within strains. Iodine production increased with Roseovarius spp. growth when cultured in Marine Broth with 200 mug ml(-1) iodide (I(-)). When 10(6) CFU/ml Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus pumilus were exposed to various concentrations of molecular iodine (I(2)), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.0 mug ml(-1), respectively. However, fivefold increases in the MICs for Roseovarius spp. were obtained. In co-cultured Roseovarius sp. IOB-7 and E. coli in Marine Broth containing iodide (I(-)), the molecular iodine concentration was estimated to be 0.76 mug ml(-1) after 24 h and less than 50 % of E. coli was viable compared to that co-cultured without iodide. The growth inhibition of E. coli was also observed in co-cultures with the two other Roseovarius spp. strains when the molecular iodine concentration was assumed to be 0.52 mug ml(-1).
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - Biodegradation of sewage wastewater using autochthonous bacteria.
AB  - The performance of isolated designed consortia comprising Bacillus pumilus, Brevibacterium sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the treatment of sewage wastewater in terms of reduction in COD (chemical oxygen demand), BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) MLSS (mixed liquor suspended solids), and TSS (total suspended solids) was studied. Different parameters were optimized (inoculum size, agitation, and temperature) to achieve effective results in less period of time. The results obtained indicated that consortium in the ratio of 1 : 2 (effluent : biomass) at 200 rpm, 35 degrees C is capable of effectively reducing the pollutional load of the sewage wastewaters, in terms of COD, BOD, TSS, and MLSS within the desired discharge limits, that is, 32 mg/L, 8 mg/L, 162 mg/L, and 190 mg/L. The use of such specific consortia can overcome the inefficiencies of the conventional biological treatment facilities currently operational in sewage treatment plants.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chemical constituents of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis Ruhland and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Chemical fractionation of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis  Ruhland afforded the flavonoids luteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), 7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), 4'-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyluteolin (5), and the xanthones 8-carboxymethyl-1,5,6-trihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (6), 8-carboxy-methyl-1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7). Methanolic extract, fractions, and isolated compounds of the leaves of L. spiralis were assayed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella setubal and Helicobacter pylori) and fungi (the yeasts Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis). We observed the best minimum inhibitory concentration values for the methanolic extract against Candida parapsilosis, for the fraction 5 + 6 against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and compound 7 against all tested Candida strains. The methanolic extract contents suggest that this species may be a promising source of compounds to produce natural phytomedicines.
TI  - Removal of high concentrations of NH(3) by a combined photoreactor and biotrickling filter system.
AB  - Average emission levels as high as 800 ppm(v) NH(3) have often been found during  the anaerobic fermentation process. At these levels, NH(3) is regarded as an environmental toxic compound. High concentrations of NH(3) gas are difficult to treat in a single treatment process, suggesting that, in terms of economic cost and treatment performance, a coupled system may be a feasible technological alternative. In the coupled TiO(2) photocatalytic-biological treatment system evaluated here, the optimal gas retention time for NH(3) removal--in terms of removal efficiency and capital cost--was 26 s. High gas temperatures, high NH(3) concentrations, and low oxygen contents were unfavorable conditions for NH(3) removal by the photoreactor. The coupled system successfully removed concentrated NH(3) gas (R % > 97 %) under disrupted and shutdown conditions. The photoreactor component of the system successfully fulfilled its role as a pretreatment process and enhanced the performance of the biotrickling filter at a high inlet NH(3) load (2,277 g-N m(-3) day(-1)). Potential ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas sp., were isolated under the high inlet NH(3) load condition. These microbial strains have a potential as biological agents in the removal of high concentrations of NH(3) in waste gas or wastewater.
TI  - First report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme produced by Bacillus pumilus SG2.
AB  - Bacillus pumilus SG2 isolated from high salinity ecosystem in Iran produces two chitinases (ChiS and ChiL) and secretes them into the medium. In this study, chiS and chiL genes were cloned in pQE-30 expression vector and were expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli strain M15. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA column. The optimum pH and optimum temperature for enzyme activity of ChiS were pH 6, 50 degrees C; those of ChiL were pH 6.5, 40 degrees C. The purified chitinases showed antifungal activity against Fusarium graminearum, Rhizoctonia solani, Magnaporthe grisea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Trichoderma reesei, Botrytis cinerea and Bipolaris sp. Moreover, purified ChiS was identified as chitinase/lysozyme, which are capable of degrading the chitin component of fungal cell walls and the peptidoglycan component of cell walls with many kinds of bacteria (Xanthomonas translucens pv. hordei, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, Bacillus licheniformis, E. coli C600, E. coli TOP10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida). Strong homology was found between the three-dimensional structures of ChiS and a chitinase/lysozyme from Bacillus circulans WL-12. This is the first report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme from B. pumilus.
TI  - Characterization of a novel biosurfactant produced by Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E with potential application on hydrocarbon bioremediation.
AB  - A biosurfactant-producing bacterium (Staphylococcus sp. strain 1E) was isolated from an Algerian crude oil contaminated soil. Biosurfactant production was tested with different carbon sources using the surface tension measurement and the oil displacement test. Olive oil produced the highest reduction in surface tension (25.9 dynes cm(-1)). Crude oil presented the best substrate for 1E biosurfactant emulsification activity. The biosurfactant produced by strain 1E reduced the growth medium surface tension below 30 dynes cm(-1). This reduction was also obtained in cell-free filtrates. Biosurfactant produced by strain 1E showed stability in a wide range of pH (from 2 to 12), temperature (from 4 to 55 degrees C) and salinity (from 0 to 300 g l(-1)) variations. The biosurfactant produced by strain 1E belonged to lipopeptide group and also constituted an antibacterial activity againt the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. Phenanthrene solubility in water was enhanced by biosurfactant addition. Our results suggest that the 1E biosurfactant has interesting properties for its application in bioremediation of hydrocarbons contaminated sites.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Effects of photoactivated titanium dioxide nanopowders and coating on planktonic  and biofilm growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - We exploited the ability of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) as an agent  for the biofilm control. Two photocatalytic systems were investigated: a 3 g L(-1) suspension of TiO(2) nanopowder in demineralized water and glass slides coated with a TiO(2) thin film, achieved by sol-gel deposition. A running protocol for the photoactivation of TiO(2) was set up using the dye rhodamine B. The microorganisms studied were Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a Bacillus cereus-group as planktonic cells. P. aeruginosa biofilms were also studied at both the solid-liquid and the solid-air interface. The TiO(2) nanopowder produced 1-log reduction of Bacillus sp. planktonic cells in 24 h, 2-log reduction of P. stutzeri planktonic cells in 30 min and 1-log reduction of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells in 2 h compared with non-photo-activated TiO(2). TiO(2) thin film produced almost a complete eradication of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells (initial concentration 10(8) cells mL(-1)) in 24 h compared to a 3-log reduction caused by UV-A light alone. In contrast, neither the photocatalytic treatment with TiO(2) film nor that with TiO(2) nanopowder had any effect on P. aeruginosa biofilms at all the interfaces investigated. Possible explanations for these findings, and for the discrepancy between this work and literature data, are discussed.
TI  - Fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in crude oil contaminated wetland ultisol.
AB  - The effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (Calopogonium muconoides and Centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. The results revealed observable effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria. The effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. Ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. Nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. The contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. A range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. The heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). On the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution levels. The LSD tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. The results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. Among the bacterial species isolated, Clostridium pasteurianum, Bacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than Azotobacter sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Derxia gummusa while Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter had the least degradability. A continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the Niger Delta ultisol.
TI  - Anti-biofilm potential of a glycolipid surfactant produced by a tropical marine strain of Serratia marcescens.
AB  - A tropical marine bacterium isolated from the hard coral, Symphyllia sp. was identified as Serratia marcescens on the basis of morphological, biochemical and 16S rDNA analysis. The bacterium showed antimicrobial activity towards the pathogens Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the marine biofouling bacterium Bacillus pumilus. S. marcescens displayed biosurfactant activity as evidenced by drop collapse, blood hemolysis and surface tension reduction (52.0-27 mN m(-1)). The active compound was purified by solvent extraction and silicic acid chromatography. Characterization was by thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and (1)H as well as (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The surfactant was found to be a glycolipid composed of glucose and palmitic acid. The glycolipid prevented adhesion of C. albicans BH, P. aeruginosa PAO1 and B. pumilus TiO1. The glycolipid also disrupted preformed biofilms of these cultures in microtitre plates. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and electron microscopy confirmed the effective removal of biofilms from glass surfaces. The glycolipid derived from S. marcescens could thus serve as a potential anti-biofilm agent.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Antipathogenic potential of marine Bacillus sp. SS4 on N-acyl-homoserine-lactone-mediated virulence factors production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1).
AB  - Antipathogenic therapy is an outcome of the quorum-sensing inhibition (QSI) mechanism, which targets autoinducer-dependent virulent gene expression in bacterial pathogens. N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) acts as a key regulator in the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and violacein pigment production in Chromobacterium violaceum. In the present study, the marine bacterial strain SS4 showed potential QSI activity in a concentration-dependent manner (0.5-2 mg/ml) against the AHL-mediated violacein production in C. violaceum (33-86%) and biofilm formation (33-88%), total protease (20-65%), LasA protease (59-68%), LasB elastase (36-68%), pyocyanin (17-86%) and pyoverdin productions in PAO1. The light and confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses confirmed the reduction of the biofilm-forming ability of PAO1 when treated with SS4 extract. Furthermore, the antibiofilm potential was confirmed through static biofilm ring assay, in which ethyl acetate extract of SS4 showed concentration-dependent reduction in the biofilm-forming ability of PAO1. Thus, the result of this study clearly reveals the antipathogenic and antibiofilm properties of the bacterial isolate SS4. Through 16S rDNA analysis, the strain SS4 was identified as Bacillus sp. (GenBank Accession Number: GU471751).
TI  - [Role of exopolymeric substances of corrosion-aggressive bacteria in the biofilm  formation on the steel surface].
AB  - It had been done the comparative study of the exopolymeric substances (EPS) synthesized by the sulfidogenic microbial community and monocultures of Desulfovibrio sp. 10, Bacillus subtilis 36 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 under various growth models as biofilm and plankton was performed. It was established that biofilm-produced exopolymers contained increased amount of glucose and fucose, while planktonic ones had more amount of mannose and rhamnose. The amount of rhamnose was 24% of the total amount of carbohydrates in the planktonic-produced exopolymers synthesized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 and Bacillus subtilis 36. Glucuronic acid, galactosamine and glucosamine along with neutral carbohydrates were found in the composition of EPS synthesized by associative cultures, while only galactosamine was found in EPS synthesized by Desulfovibrio sp. 10. The amount of hexuronic acids and hexozamines was, respectively, 4.6 and 1.6 times higher in the biofilm formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 on the steel surface, than in the planktonic exopolymers. It is discussed the role in the biofilm formation of dominative members of the corrosion-aggressive microbial community.
TI  - Isolation of a selected microbial consortium capable of degrading methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol from a contaminated soil site.
AB  - A bacterial consortium with the ability to degrade methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol, using these compounds as the only carbon source, was obtained by selective enrichment in a medium with methyl parathion. Samples were taken from Moravia, Medellin; an area that is highly contaminated, owing to the fact that it was used as a garbage dump from 1974 to 1982. Acinetobacter sp, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas sp, Flavobacterium sp, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp, Acinetobacter sp, Klebsiella sp and Proteus sp were the microorganisms identified within the consortium. In culture, the consortium was able to degrade 150 mg L(-)(1) of methyl-parathion and p-nitrophenol in 120 h, but after adding glucose or peptone to the culture, the time of degradation decreased to 24 h. In soil, the consortium was also able to degrade 150 mg L(-)(1) of methyl parathion in 120 h at different depths and also managed to decrease the toxicity.
TI  - Synthesis, stereochemistry, antimicrobial evaluation and QSAR studies of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - A series of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones (11-27) were synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Rhizopus sp., Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were evaluated. Compounds 21 and 22 showed maximum inhibition potency at low concentration (6.25 mug/ml) against P. aeruginosa. For antifungal activity, 20 and 21 were effective against C. neoformans and 22-24 against C. albicans at minimum concentration. Further, the results of QSAR studies of these synthesized compounds indicated the importance of weakly polar component of surface area, hydrophobicity and ionization potential parameters in defining their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Streptomyces fenghuangensis sp. nov., isolated from seawater.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.003(T), was isolated from seawater collected in Sanya, China. It produced white aerial mycelium and yellow substrate mycelium on Gause's synthetic agar medium no. 1. The substrate mycelium colour was not sensitive to pH. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that GIMN4.003(T) produced straight to flexuous spore chains of rough to warty spores. ll-Diaminopimelic acid was present in the cell-wall hydrolysate. Based on chemotaxonomy and morphological features, strain GIMN4.003(T) was identified as a member of the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was not produced. No antimicrobial activity was detected against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Penicillium citrinum or Candida albicans. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the highest sequence similarity was to Streptomyces radiopugnans R97(T) (99.0%). However, DNA relatedness between GIMN4.003(T) and S. radiopugnans DSM 41901(T) was low (41.24+/-1.47%). Furthermore, the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain GIMN4.003(T) were different from those of S. radiopugnans DSM 41901(T) and the type strains of other closely related Streptomyces species. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is evident that strain GIMN4.003(T) (=CCTCCM 208215(T) =NRRL B-24801(T)) represents the type strain of a novel species within the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces fenghuangensis sp. nov. is proposed.
TI  - [Changes in the bacterial spectrum in severe burn wounds].
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the time axis for increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients hospitalized at the Clinic of burns and reconstructive surgery between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled in the study. The major criteria for enrolment were more than 15% of total body surface area (TBSA) burned, hospital stay of 1 month or more and age over 18 years. Specimens for microbiological examination were collected on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20 after admission. RESULTS: A total of 777 bacterial strains were isolated from the study patients, with 64.6% of these strains being Gram positive and 35.4% Gram negative. The most frequently isolated Gram positive pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (260 strains) and Bacillus sp. (113 strains), while the most common Gram negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains), Escherichia coli (63 strains) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (57 strains). CONCLUSION: The study provided data that supports the assumption of increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. Nevertheless, even on day 20 after admission, such strains did not predominate.
TI  - Cross-species induction of antimicrobial compounds, biosurfactants and quorum-sensing inhibitors in tropical marine epibiotic bacteria by pathogens and biofouling microorganisms.
AB  - Enhancement or induction of antimicrobial, biosurfactant, and quorum-sensing inhibition property in marine bacteria due to cross-species and cross-genera interactions was investigated. Four marine epibiotic bacteria (Bacillus sp. S3, B. pumilus S8, B. licheniformis D1, and Serratia marcescens V1) displaying antimicrobial activity against pathogenic or biofouling fungi (Candida albicans CA and Yarrowia lipolytica YL), and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA and Bacillus pumilus BP) were chosen for this study. The marine epibiotic bacteria when co-cultivated with the aforementioned fungi or bacteria showed induction or enhancement in antimicrobial activity, biosurfactant production, and quorum-sensing inhibition. Antifungal activity against Y. lipolytica YL was induced by co-cultivation of the pathogens or biofouling strains with the marine Bacillus sp. S3, B. pumilus S8, or B. licheniformis D1. Antibacterial activity against Ps. aeruginosa PA or B. pumilus BP was enhanced in most of the marine isolates after co-cultivation. Biosurfactant activity was significantly increased when cells of B. pumilus BP were co-cultivated with S. marcescens V1, B. pumilus S8, or B. licheniformis D1. Pigment reduction in the quorum-sensing inhibition indicator strain Chromobacterium violaceum 12472 was evident when the marine strain of Bacillus sp. S3 was grown in the presence of the inducer strain Ps. aeruginosa PA, suggesting quorum-sensing inhibition. The study has important ecological and biotechnological implications in terms of microbial competition in natural environments and enhancement of secondary metabolite production.
TI  - Heronapyrroles A-C: farnesylated 2-nitropyrroles from an Australian marine-derived Streptomyces sp.
AB  - Chemical analysis of a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0423) isolated from  beach sand off Heron Island, Australia, yielded three new members of the rare pyrroloterpene biosynthetic structure class. Identified by detailed spectroscopic analysis as the first reported examples of naturally occurring 2-nitropyrroles, heronapyrroles A-C (1-3) displayed promising biological activity-with low to submicromolar IC(50) activity against Gram-positive bacteria but no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cell lines.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, spectrophotometric, structural and antimicrobial studies of the newly charge transfer complex of p-phenylenediamine with pi acceptor picric acid.
AB  - Charge transfer complex (CTC) of donor, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and acceptor, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) has been studied in methanol at room temperature. The CT complex was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectra, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectra which indicate the CT interaction associated with proton migration from the acceptor to the donor followed by hydrogen bonding via N+-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO-. The thermal stability of CT complex was studied using TGA and DTA analyses techniques. The CT complex was screened for its antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger (Laboratory isolate), Candida albicans (IQA-109) and Penicillium sp. (Laboratory isolate) and antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 22) and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051) and two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (K 12) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 2488). It gives good antimicrobial activity. The stoichiometry of the CT complex was found to be 1:1. The physical parameters of CT complex were evaluated by the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. On the basis of the studies, the structure of CT complex is [(PPDH)+(PA)-], and a general mechanism for its formation is proposed.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Production of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in water extracts of the fungus  Amylomyces rouxii strain KSU-09.
AB  - A fungal strain, KSU-09, isolated from the roots of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), was identified as Amylomyces rouxii based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of its rRNA genes. Mycelia-free water extracts obtained from mycelium suspended in water for 72h facilitated the production of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the size range of 5-27nm upon addition of 1mM silver nitrate, as determined by the XRD, AFM and TEM. The AgNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae type I, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, the strain KSU-09 could be used for simple, non-hazardous and efficient synthesis of antimicrobial AgNPs.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and phylogeny of sponge-associated bacteria with antimicrobial activities from Brazil.
AB  - Bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with antimicrobial activities from Brazilian sponges. A total of 158 colony-forming units were isolated from nine sponge species. Among these, 12 isolates presented antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria. Based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16S rRNA genes, the sponge-associated bacterial strains could be subdivided into three phylogenetically different clusters. Five strains were affiliated with Firmicutes (genera Bacillus and Virgibacillus), three with alpha-Proteobacteria (Pseudovibrio sp.) and four with gamma-Proteobacteria (genera Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas). The sponge-associated bacterial strains Pseudomonas fluorescens H40 and H41 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa H51 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including strains such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacillus pumilus Pc31 and Pc32, Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola Pm31 and Ca31 and Pseudovibrio denitrificans Mm37 strains were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria. These findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the search for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of prunin, a citric flavanone glucoside, and its prunin  6''-O-lauroyl ester.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (P), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-O-lauroyl ester (PL), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: P and its lauroyl ester were tested against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. P showed no inhibitory effect against the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and different Bacilllus sp. However, 150 mug ml(-1) of PL inhibited Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, many Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Enterococcus avium DSMZ17511, and different Listeria monocytogenes strains. In the last case, L. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. A bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning and transmission electronic microscopies. CONCLUSIONS: PL could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. A bactericidal effect was also determined on L. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. P did not show any antimicrobial property at all. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PL is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-Listeria property.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3J6.
AB  - Biofilm formation results in medical threats or economic losses and is therefore  a major concern in a variety of domains. In two-species biofilms of marine bacteria grown under dynamic conditions, Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3J6 formed mixed biofilms with Bacillus sp. strain 4J6 but was largely predominant over Paracoccus sp. strain 4M6 and Vibrio sp. strain D01. The supernatant of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 liquid culture (SN(3J6)) was devoid of antibacterial activity against free-living Paracoccus sp. 4M6 and Vibrio sp. D01 cells, but it impaired their ability to grow as single-species biofilms and led to higher percentages of nonviable cells in 48-h biofilms. Antibiofilm molecules of SN(3J6) were able to coat the glass surfaces used to grow biofilms and reduced bacterial attachment about 2-fold, which might partly explain the biofilm formation defect but not the loss of cell viability. SN(3J6) had a wide spectrum of activity since it affected all Gram-negative marine strains tested except other Pseudoalteromonas strains. Biofilm biovolumes of the sensitive strains were reduced 3- to 530-fold, and the percentages of nonviable cells were increased 3- to 225-fold. Interestingly, SN(3J6) also impaired biofilm formation by three strains belonging to the human-pathogenic species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli. Such an antibiofilm activity is original and opens up a variety of applications for Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 and/or its active exoproducts in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - Culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  - Culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a German dairy company and a Spanish dry cured ham company. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. Autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised DGGE DNA bands. More specifically, real-time PCR was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella spp, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to the detection limits of the real-time PCR method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. Autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. Only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the German dairy company. Enterococci and P.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. Some opportunistic bacteria as Enterobacter sp., Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic Bacillus, were also detected after DNA sequencing of DGGE bands.
TI  - Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants.
AB  - A novel actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.001(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants grown in Guangzhou, China. The strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on potato dextrose agar and yeast extract-malt extract agar. The colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to pH. Microscopic observations revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. Chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain GIMN4.001(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin pigments were not produced. No antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis or Candida albicans, but inhibitory activity was observed against Penicillium citrinum. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain GIMN4.001(T) was related most closely to Streptomyces morookaense ATCC 19166(T) (98.9 % similarity) and Streptomyces lavenduligriseus ATCC 13306(T) (98.7 %). Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.001(T) and the type strains of these species were low (14-20 %). Furthermore, strain GIMN4.001(T) could be differentiated from S. morookaense, S. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus Streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain GIMN4.001(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMN4.001(T) (=CCTCC M208214(T)=NRRL B-24800(T)).
TI  - Modified phenazines from an Indonesian Streptomyces sp.
AB  - Fractionation of the extract from the Indonesian Streptomyces sp. ICBB8198 as directed by the antibacterial activity delivered the known phenazine antibiotics griseoluteic acid (1a) and griseolutein A (1b), as well as two new phenazine derivatives (2 and 3). In addition, the known compounds spirodionic acid, dihydrosarkomycins, and 6-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-one (4a), along with the new pyrone 3,6-diethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (4b), were isolated. We report here the isolation, structure elucidation, and antibiotic activity of the new metabolites as well as a hypothetical pathway for the formation of the new phenazine derivatives.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Characterization of corrosive bacterial consortia isolated from petroleum-product-transporting pipelines.
AB  - Microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. The present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in India, using traditional cultivation technique and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of the isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely Serratia marcescens ACE2, Bacillus subtilis AR12, Bacillus cereus ACE4, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AI1, Klebsiella oxytoca ACP, Pseudomonas stutzeri AP2, Bacillus litoralis AN1, Bacillus sp., Bacillus pumilus AR2, Bacillus carboniphilus AR3, and Bacillus megaterium AR4. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. The dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were B. cereus and S. marcescens in the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. Therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. In addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Lyngbyazothrins A-D, antimicrobial cyclic undecapeptides from the cultured Cyanobacterium lyngbya sp.
AB  - Four novel cyclic undecapeptides, lyngbyazothrins A (1), B (2), C (3), and D (4), were isolated from the cultured Lyngbya sp. 36.91 as binary mixtures (1/2 and 3/4). Their structures were elucidated by analysis of 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC) NMR spectra, ESIMSMS, ESITOFMS, and amino acid analyses. Three unusual amino acids were present and identified as 4-methoxyhomophenylalanine in 1 and 3, homophenylalanine in 2 and 4, and 3-amino-2,5,7,8-tetrahydroxy-10-methylundecanoic acid (Aound) in all compounds, while 3 and 4 have an additional N-acetyl-N-methyltyrosine unit. The mixture of lyngbyazothrins A (1) and B (2) shows only low antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus flavus, whereas the mixture of lyngbyazothrins C (3) and D (4) was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. It seems that the acyl residue at C-5 of the Aound unit plays an important role in antimicrobial activity.
TI  - New thioureides of 2-(4-methylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro, by means of qualitative and quantative methods, the antimicrobial activity of some new synthesized chemical compounds previously solubilized in DMF (Dimethyl formamide). The qualitative screening of the susceptibility spectra of different microbial strains versus these compounds was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter disk impregnation with the tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium previously inoculated with microbial suspension. The quantitative assay of the antimicrobial activity was performed by broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).The antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus) aureus sp., Bacillus subtilis sp.), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa sp., Klebsiella pneumonia sp.) and fungal strains (Candida albicans sp, Aspergillus nige rsp.). All tests were performed by comparison with the reference strains: K. pneumoniae IC 13420, E. coli IC 13529, S. aureus IC 13204, P. aeruginosa IC 13202, B. subtilis IC 12488, C. albicans IC 249, A. niger IC 13534. Our results indicated that the tested compounds exhibited specific antimicrobial activity, the highest activity being noticed against planktonic fungal cells (MIC ranging from 62.5 microg to 15.6 microg), followed by P. aeruginosa (MICs from 250 microg to 31.5 microg). Only few compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria was noticed for the most of the tested compounds, five of them exhibiting very low MIC values (MICs from 1000 microg to 62.5 microg).
TI  - Tetracycline and chloramphenicol efficiency against selected biofilm forming bacteria.
AB  - Despite the constantly increasing need for new antimicrobial agents, antibiotic drug discovery and development seem to have greatly decelerated in recent years. Presented with the significant problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance, the global scientific community has attempted to find alternative solutions; one of the most promising ones is the evaluation and use of old antibiotic compounds. A number of old antibiotic compounds, such as aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline, are re-emerging as valuable alternatives for the treatment of difficult-to-treat infections. This study examined the in vitro potency for biofilm formation of five isolates (Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Achromobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus pumilis) and the effects of antibiotics on these biofilms. Furthermore the quantitative analysis of planktonic, loosely attached cells, and their susceptibility to antibiotics was also determined. Twitching motility was observed to determine any effect in the biofilm forming capability of the isolates. All the isolates tested were efficient biofilm-forming strains in the polypropylene and borosilicate test tubes. Standard bacterial enumeration technique and CV staining produced equivalent results both in biofilm and planktonic assays. The biofilm formation of all the strains was affected in the presence of tetracycline or chloramphenicol. Highly significant decrease (P < 0.01) in biofilm formation was observed by treatment with chloramphenicol compared to tetracycline. In addition, the two antibiotics also affected adversely the planktonic and loosely attached cells of all isolates. Thus, testing the effects of older antibiotics on biofilms may supply useful information in addition to standard in vitro testing, particularly in diseases where biofilm formation is involved in the pathogenesis.
TI  - Earthquakes promote bacterial genetic exchange in serpentinite crevices.
AB  - We report the results of our efforts to study the effects of seismic shaking on simulated biofilms within serpentinite fissures. A colloidal solution consisting of recipient bacterial cells (Pseudomonas sp. or Bacillus subtilis), donor plasmid DNA encoded for antibiotic resistance, and chrysotile (an acicular clay mineral that forms in crevices of serpentinite layers) were placed onto an elastic body made from gellan gum, which acted as the biofilm matrix. Silica beads, as rock analogues (i.e., chemically inert mechanical serpentinite), were placed on the gellan surface, which was coated with the colloidal solution. A rolling vibration similar to vibrations generated by earthquakes was applied, and the silica beads moved randomly across the surface of the gellan. This resulted in the recipient cells' acquiring plasmid DNA and thus becoming genetically transformed to demonstrate marked antibiotic resistance. Neither Pseudomonas sp. nor B. subtilis were transformed by plasmid DNA when chrysotile was substituted for by kaolinite or bentonite in the colloidal solution. Tough gellan (1.0%) promoted the introduction of plasmid DNA into Pseudomonas sp., but soft gellan (0.3%) had no such effect. Genetic transformation of bacteria on the surface of gellan by exposure to exogenous plasmid DNA required seismic shaking and exposure to the acicular clay mineral chrysotile. These experimental results suggest that bacterial genetic exchange readily occurs when biofilms that form in crevices of serpentinite are exposed to seismic shaking. Seismic activity may be a key factor in bacterial evolution along with the formation of biofilms within crevices of serpentinite.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - Biodegradation of mixed pesticides by mixed pesticide enriched cultures.
AB  - This paper discusses the degradation kinetics of mixed (lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran) pesticides by mixed pesticide enriched cultures (MEC) under various environmental conditions. The bacterial strains isolated from the mixed microbial consortium were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 9236), Bacillus sp. (MTCC 9235) and Chryseobacterium joostei (MTCC 9237). Batch studies were conducted to estimate the biokinetic parameters like the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)), Yield Coefficient (Y(T)), half saturation concentration (K(s)) and inhibition concentration (Ki) for individual and mixed pesticide enriched cultures. The cultures enriched in a particular pollutant always showed high growth rate and low inhibition in that particular pollutant compared to MEC. After seven weeks of incubation, mixed pesticide enriched cultures were able to degrade 72% lindane, 95% carbofuran and 100% of methyl parathion in facultative co-metabolic conditions. In aerobic systems, degradation efficiencies of lindane methyl parathion and carbofuran were increased by the addition of 2g L(- 1) of dextrose. Though many metabolic compounds of mixed pesticides were observed at different time intervals, none of the metabolites were persistent. Based on the observed metabolites, a degradation pathway was postulated for different pesticides under various environmental conditions.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Endophytic bacterial flora in root and stem tissues of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) genotype: isolation, identification and evaluation against Phytophthora capsici.
AB  - AIM: To isolate and identify black pepper (Piper nigrum L) associated endophytic  bacteria antagonistic to Phytophthora capsici causing foot rot disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endophytic bacteria (74) were isolated, characterized and evaluated against P. capsici. Six genera belong to Pseudomonas spp (20 strains), Serratia (1 strain), Bacillus spp. (22 strains), Arthrobacter spp. (15 strains), Micrococcus spp. (7 strains), Curtobacterium sp. (1 strain) and eight unidentified strains were isolated from internal tissues of root and stem. Three isolates, IISRBP 35, IISRBP 25 and IISRBP 17 were found effective for Phytophthora suppression in multilevel screening assays which recorded over 70% disease suppression in greenhouse trials. A species closest match (99% similarity) of IISRBP 35 was established as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseudomonas EF568931), IISRBP 25 as P. putida (Pseudomonas EF568932), and IISRBP 17 as Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium EU071712) based on 16S rDNA sequencing. CONCLUSION: Black pepper associated P. aeruginosa, P. putida and B. megaterium were identified as effective antagonistic endophytes for biological control of Phytophthora foot rot in black pepper. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work provides the first evidence for endophytic bacterial diversity in black pepper stem and roots, with biocontrol potential against P. capsici infection.
TI  - Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos in soil by enriched cultures.
AB  - Three aerobic bacterial consortia, AC, BC, and DC, developed from pesticide-contaminated soils of Punjab were able to degrade chlorpyrifos after 21 days of incubation in basal medium by 54, 46, and 61% and chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in soil after 30 days by 50, 56, and 64%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella sp., and Serratia marscecens obtained from these consortia showed 84, 84, 81, and 80% degradation of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in liquid medium after 20 days and 92, 60, 56, and 37% degradation of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in soil after 30 days. Populations of Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella sp., and Serratia marscecens remained steady in soil experiments except for P. aeruginosa, where the population showed a substantial increase. Formation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, the major metabolite of chlorpyrifos degradation, was observed during the degradation of chlorpyrifos by P. aeruginosa, which disappeared to negligible amounts.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Investigation on species composition of cockroaches and bacteria-carrying on their bodies in five cities of Hainan].
AB  - "ZA-type" cages were used to capture cockroaches in 267 sites of 5 cities in Hainan. Species were identified and bacteria were isolated by routine method. 441 cockroaches were collected and identified as five species belonging to two genera, 75.3% being Periplaneta americana. More cockroaches were found in sewerage. Bacteria were detected from 82.4% of cockroaches, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sp, Bacillus proteus and sort of mycetes. Therefore, the dominant species is Periplaneta americana in Hainan, and the high bacteria-carrying behavior of cockroaches indicates its importance in disease transmission.
TI  - Proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  - Aerobic granules lose stability during storage. The goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. The quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. The proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16S rDNA sequences. The proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera Pseudomonas, Raoultella, Acinetobacter, Pandoraea, Klebsiella, Bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into Proteobacteria, Enterobacteria and Firmicutes. The PB1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close to the obligate anaerobic strain Bacteroides sp. Hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. This process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.
TI  - Comparison of plant growth-promotion with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis in three vegetables.
AB  - Our objective was to compare some plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) properties of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as representatives of their two genera. Solanum lycopersicum L. (tomato), Abelmoschus esculentus (okra), and Amaranthus sp. (African spinach) were inoculated with the bacterial cultures. At 60 days after planting, dry biomass for plants treated with B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa increased 31% for tomato, 36% and 29% for okra, and 83% and 40% for African spinach respectively over the non-bacterized control. Considering all the parameters tested, there were similarities but no significant difference at P < 0.05 between the overall performances of the two organisms.
TI  - Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates co-polymer in E. coli using genes from Pseudomonas and Bacillus.
AB  - Expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes PHA synthase1 (phaC1) and (R)-specific enoyl CoA hydratase1 (phaJ1) under a lacZ promoter was able to support production of a copolymer of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and medium chain length polyhydoxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) in Escherichia coli. In order to improve the yield and quality of PHA, plasmid bearing the above genes was introduced into E. coli JC7623, harboring integrated beta-ketothiolase (phaA) and NADPH dependent-acetoacetyl CoA reductase (phaB) genes from a Bacillus sp. also driven by a lacZ promoter. The recombinant E. coli (JC7623ABC1J1) grown on various fatty acids along with glucose was found to produce 28-34% cellular dry weight of PHA. Gas chromatography and (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis of the polymer confirmed the ability of the strain to produce PHB-co-Hydroxy valerate (HV)-co-mcl-PHA copolymers. The ratio of short chain length (scl) to mcl-PHA varied from 78:22 to 18:82. Addition of acrylic acid, an inhibitor of beta-oxidation resulted in improved production (3-11% increase) of PHA copolymer. The combined use of enzymes from Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. for the production of scl-co-mcl PHA in E. coli is a novel approach and is being reported for the first time.
TI  - Detoxification of toxic heavy metals by marine bacteria highly resistant to mercury.
AB  - Pollution in industrial areas is a serious environmental concern, and interest in bacterial resistance to heavy metals is of practical significance. Mercury (Hg), Cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) are known to cause damage to living organisms, including human beings. Several marine bacteria highly resistant to mercury (BHRM) capable of growing at 25 ppm (mg L(-1)) or higher concentrations of mercury were tested during this study to evaluate their potential to detoxify Cd and Pb. Results indicate their potential of detoxification not only of Hg, but also Cd and Pb. Through biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, these bacteria were identified to belong to Alcaligenes faecalis (seven isolates), Bacillus pumilus (three isolates), Bacillus sp. (one isolate), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one isolate), and Brevibacterium iodinium (one isolate). The mechanisms of heavy metal detoxification were through volatilization (for Hg), putative entrapment in the extracellular polymeric substance (for Hg, Cd and Pb) as revealed by the scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and/or precipitation as sulfide (for Pb). These bacteria removed more than 70% of Cd and 98% of Pb within 72 and 96 h, respectively, from growth medium that had initial metal concentrations of 100 ppm. Their detoxification efficiency for Hg, Cd and Pb indicates good potential for application in bioremediation of toxic heavy metals.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Purification of a lectin from Eugenia uniflora L. seeds and its potential antibacterial activity.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to analyse the antimicrobial properties of a purified lectin from Eugenia uniflora L. seeds. METHODS AND RESULTS: The E. uniflora lectin (EuniSL) was isolated from the seed extract and purified by ion-exchange chromatography in DEAE-Sephadex with a purification factor of 11.68. The purified lectin showed a single band on denaturing electrophoresis, with a molecular mass of 67 kDa. EuniSL agglutinated rabbit and human erythrocytes with a higher specificity for rabbit erythrocytes. The haemagglutination was not inhibited by the tested carbohydrates but glycoproteins exerted a strong inhibitory action. The lectin proved to be thermo resistant with the highest stability at pH 6.5 and divalent ions did not affect its activity. EuniSL demonstrated a remarkable nonselective antibacterial activity. EuniSL strongly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella sp. with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.5 microg ml(-1), and moderately inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 16.5 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: EuniSL was found to be effective against bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strong antibacterial activity of the studied lectin indicates a high potential for clinical microbiology and therapeutic applications.
TI  - Biodegradability of commercial and weathered diesel oils.
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the groundwater at a petrol station. Two microbiological methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. In the former we tested the bacterial cultures Staphylococcus hominis, Kocuria palustris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI, Ochrobactrum anthropi and Bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. In the respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. The redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia, even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. In 48 days, the removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. This difference was caused by the consumption of labile hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas chromatographic analyses. Thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - [Characteristics of adhesion of epiphytic bacteria on leaves of the seagrass Zostera marina and on abiotic surfaces].
AB  - A comparative study of the adhesion of epiphytic bacteria and marine free-living, saprophytic, and pathogenic bacteria on seagrass leaves and abiotic surfaces was performed to prove the occurrence of true epiphytes of Zostera marina and to elucidate the bacterium-plant symbiotrophic relationships. It was shown that in the course of adhesion to the seagrass leaves of two taxonomically different bacteria, Cytophaga sp. KMM 3552 and Pseudoalteromonas citrea KMM 461, isolated from the seagrass surface, the number of viable cells increased 3-7-fold after 60 h of incubation, reaching 1.0-2.0 x 10(5) cells/cm2; however, in the case of adhesion of these bacteria to abiotic surfaces, such as glass or metal, virtually no viable cells were observed after 60 h of incubation. Such selectivity of cell adhesion was not observed in the case of three other bacterial species studied, viz., Vibrio alginolyticus KMM 3551, Bacillus subtilis KMM 430, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa KMM 433. The amount of viable cells of V. alginolyticus KMM 3551 adsorbed on glass and metal surfaces increased twofold after 40 h of incubation. The cells of saprophytic B. subtilis KMM 430 and pathogenic P. aeruginosa KMM 433 adsorbed on three studied substrata remained viable for 36 h and died by the 60th hour of incubation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov., a streptomycete with violet blue diffusible pigment isolated from soil in Vietnam.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMV4.0001(T), was isolated from a forest soil sample in Vietnam. It produced white aerial mycelium and violet-blue diffusible pigment on Gause's synthetic agar. The substrate mycelium colour was not sensitive to pH. Micoscopic observations revealed that strain GIMV4.0001(T) produced long, straight chains of cylindrical spores, and chemotaxonomic data confirmed that it belongs to the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was produced, but no antibacterial activity was evident against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans or Penicillium citrinum. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GIMV4.0001(T) revealed that the highest similarity (99.4 %) was to Streptomyces bikiniensis ATCC 11062(T). However, the DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMV4.0001(T) and S. bikiniensis ATCC 11062(T) was found to be 50.3 %. Strain GIMV4.0001(T) could also be differentiated from S. bikiniensis ATCC 11062(T) and other Streptomyces species showing high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98-99 %) based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is evident that strain GIMV4.0001(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GIMV4.0001(T) (=CCTCC M 205143(T)=IAM 15340(T)).
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - The identification of antibacterial compounds for the development of enhanced media for the detection of foodborne fungi.
AB  - In an effort to identify a more suitable antibiotic for utilization in mycological media, 12 food borne fungal species from various genera including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Eurotium chevalieri, Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum, Rhodotorula glutinis and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans along with 21 chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial isolates from fresh produce and ATCC cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, E. coli, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus spp. were tested for their abilities to grow on dichloran rose bengal agar containing various levels of gentamicin, chlortetracycline or chloramphenicol. Results indicated that all fungal isolates except for Rh. glutinis and R. stolonifer grew well on all media tested. Rh. glutinis did not grow on media containing gentamicin whereas R. stolonifer produced very restricted or no growth on these media. All bacterial isolates from fresh produce, P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and P. fluorescens (ATCC BAA-477) grew well at 100, 125 and 150 mg chloramphenicol/liter medium, but they did not grow on media containing chlortetracycline (100, 125, or 150 mg/L) or gentamicin (15, 25, or 35 mg/L). P. aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) grew well on media containing chloramphenicol or gentamicin, but not in the presence of chlortetracycline. P. carotovorum, E. coli, B. cereus and Staphylococcus spp. did not grow on any of the selective media tested.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - A marine Mesorhizobium sp. produces structurally novel long-chain N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones.
AB  - Our study focused on a Mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16S rRNA gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), with chain lengths of C(10) to C(16). Chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones, 5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) (compound 1) and 5-cis-C(12)-HSL (compound 2). Quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [Escherichia coli MT102(pSB403) and Pseudomonas putida F117(pKR-C12)]. Furthermore, it was shown that both compounds can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an AHL-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 lasI rhlI double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. In conclusion, these data indicate that the quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. Additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of essential oil from Hedychium coronarium.
AB  - The essential oil from fresh and dried rhizomes of Hedychium coronarium on GC-MS  analysis resulted in the identification of 44 and 38 constituents representing 93.91% and 95.41%, respectively. The major components of the essential oil from fresh and dried Hedychium coronarium rhizome were 1,8-cineole (41.42%, 37.44%), beta-pinene (10.39%, 17.4%) and alpha-terpineol (8.8%, 6.7%). The aromatic oil has antifungal as well as antibacterial effects. The antimicrobial activities of the essential oil were individually evaluated against four microorganisms, including two bacteria and two fungi. It was found that the antimicrobial activity was higher in the fresh sample than the dried. Both samples showed a better activity against Trichoderma sp. and Candida albicans than against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Heteroscorpine-1 (HS-1) toxin from Heterometrus laoticus scorpion venom.
AB  - Crude venom from Thai giant scorpion, Heterometrus laoticus, most commonly found  in the northeastern area of Thailand, was evaluated for PD50 (paralytic dose 50) activities from abdominal injection to cricket (Gryllus sp.) and activities against various kinds of microorganisms. It exhibited good results in disc diffusion assay for Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. After purification, toxin showed acceptable results for PD50 determination in entrapped cricket as well as inhibitory activity against B. subtilis, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa with activities over 300 times higher than that of the crude venom. The purified fraction was showed to contain a single band in SDS-PAGE. MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis showed one peak of major protein with 8293Da. Partial amino acid sequence show high homology to Scorpine-a polypeptide toxin family with potassium channel blocking and defensin activity. The novel toxin was named "Heteroscorpine-1" (HS-1) as the first Scorpine from genus Heterometrus. After full length determination by PCR, HS-1 gene was found to be composed of two exons, separated by an intron. Deduction revealed 95 amino acid residues with 19 residues as the leading sequence. It showed about 80% similarity to Panscorpine and Opiscorpine.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides.
AB  - Six unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides RR'TeCl2 (where R= phenacyl-, 1-naphthacyl-, and styrylacyl- and R' = p-methoxyphenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl-, and 3-methyl-4-hydoxyphenyl-) were tested for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Salmonella sp.) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was measured by disk diffusion method. Inhibition zones demonstrated that all the compounds showed good activity against gram-negative strains. Phenacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride and naphthacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride showed significant activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative strains. Among the tested compounds, the former exhibited maximum activity against gram-positive bacteria, while the latter against all the bacteria under study and styrylacyl (p-methoxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride against all the three gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A comparative study on the effect of plant extracts with the antibiotics on organisms of hospital origin.
AB  - Thirty five plants belonging to twenty families were studied for their antimicrobial activity. Among the plants tested, 43 % showed antimicrobial activity. Fifteen plants belonging to 10 families exhibited activity against gram positive bacteria and gram negative bacteria. Four plants namely Azadirachta indica, Garadenia jasminoides, Magnifera indica, and Wrightia tinctora showed an appreciable activity against the gram positive bacteria and seven plants against gram negative organisms. Leaf extract of Tabermontana coronaria showed a maximum zone of inhibition (24 mm) against Staphylococcus aureus and the leaf extract of Sida cordifolia showed a maximum zone (20 mm) against Corynebacteriun diphtheriae. Mentha piperanta gave a maximum zone size against E,coli (22 mm) and Vibrio cholerae (20mm). The inhibitory percentage of the leaf extracts against various pathogens were observed to be Staphylococcus aureus (40%), E.coli (28%), Shigella sp (25%), Salmonella sp (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis (20%), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris (17%), Vibrio cholera (14%) and Corynebacterium diphtheriae (11%). The results suggested that the leaf extracts of various plants has significant antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. The present study is done to compare the activity of the plant extracts with the activity of currently used antibiotics against the selected organisms.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Arctium lappa constituents against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antimicrobial activity of rough extracts from leaves of Arctium lappa and their phases. The following microorganisms, commonly found in the oral cavity, specifically in endodontic infections, were used: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The agar-diffusion method allowed detection of the hexanic phase as an inhibitor of microbial growth. Bioautographic assays identified antimicrobial substances in the extract. The results showed the existence, in the rough hexanic phase and in its fractions, of constituents that have retention factors (Rf) in three distinct zones, thereby suggesting the presence of active constituents with chemical structures of different polarities that exhibited specificity against the target microorganisms. It may be concluded that the Arctium lappa constituents exhibited a great microbial inhibition potential against the tested endodontic pathogens.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the gene encoding Vibrio metalloproteinase vimelysin and isolation of a mutant with high stability in organic solvents.
AB  - Vimelysin is a unique metalloproteinase from Vibrio sp. T1800 exhibiting high activity at low temperature and high stability in organic solvents such as ethanol. A 1,821 bp open reading frame of the vimelysin gene encoded 607 amino acid residues consisting of an N-terminal pro-region, a mature enzyme, and a C-terminal pro-region. The mature enzyme region showed 80%, 57% and 35% sequence identity with the mature forms of vibriolysin from V. vulnificus, pseudolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and thermolysin from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, respectively. The catalytic residues and zinc-binding motifs of metalloproteinases are well conserved in vimelysin. The vimelysin gene was expressed in E. coli JM109 cells and the recombinant enzyme was purified as a 38-kDa mature form from cell-free extracts. The purified recombinant enzyme is indistinguishable from the enzyme purified directly from Vibrio. To obtain mutants exhibiting higher stability in organic solvents, random mutations were introduced by error-prone PCR and 600 transformants were screened. The N123D mutant exhibits two times higher stability in organic solvents than the wild-type enzyme. A plausible mechanism for the stability of the N123D mutant in organic solvents was discussed based on homology models of vimelysin and the N123D mutant.
TI  - Characterization of contamination in and toxicities of a shipyard area in Hong Kong.
AB  - This is the first integrated study on the contaminant characterization and toxicities of a shipyard area. This site in Hong Kong contained 3.6-33.4 mg kg(-1) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and 5-79 g kg(-1) oil and grease. Other pollutants exceeding the Dutch intervention values were total polyaromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals Cu, Pb and Zn. These pollutants persisted partially owing to the poor fertility with <125 mg N kg(-1) and <530 mg P kg(-1) typical of coastal soil. Sediments collected within 100 m also showed contamination exceeding the China and Hong Kong intervention levels. The shipyard soil killed two bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Acinetobacter sp. isolated from a clean coastal soil, inhibited germination of three exogenous plants Triticum aestivum, Brassica chinense and Lolium perenne, and inhibited proliferation of three indigenous bacteria: Methylobacterium sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Thus, ex situ remediation was needed.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Screening of actinomycetes isolated from soil samples of Ajmer, Rajasthan for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Several strains of actinomycetes were isolated from soil samples collected from various localities ofAjmer district. These isolates were tested for their antagonistic proerties against few test organisms viz. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger. Some of these actinomycete strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against bacteria, no antifungal activity was observed. Six such isolates were selected for detailed morphological, cultural, physiological and biochemical studies for identification. Five of these were identified as members beloging to the genus Streptomyces and the remaining one belonging to the genus Actinoplanes.
TI  - Antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activity of selected basidiomycetes from Yemen.
AB  - Dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of 23 selected Basidiomycetes species fruiting bodies collected in Yemen were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activities against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus), two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and against one yeast fungus (Candida maltosa), as well as for their cytotoxic and antioxidant activity. The highest antibacterial activity was shown by extracts from Agaricus sp. (Type 1), Coriolopsis caperata, Ganoderma colossus, Ganoderma resinaceum, Phellorinia herculea and Tulostoma obesum. Strong antioxidative effects employing the DPPH assay were exhibited by methanol extracts from Ganoderma resinaceum, Inonotus ochroporus, Phellinus rimosus and Phellorinia herculea. The results provide evidence that some of the studied fungi might be potential sources for new biologically active agents.
TI  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media.
AB  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media were investigated for seven typical rod-shaped bacterial strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceas, and Bacillaceae, which included Escherichia coli HB101, Escherichia coli JM109, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., and Bacillus subtilis. All the microorganisms studied exhibited a monopolar and predominant hydrophilic surface and a negative Delta G132tot, total free energy of interactions between microbes (1) and silica gel or Canadian River Alluvium (CRA) (2) immersed in water (3) at the equilibrium distance, which accounted for their attachment on the medium surface. The microbial attachment was proportional to the corresponding Delta G132tot values. Among the microorganisms studied, B. subtilis had the most attachment on both silica gel and CRA because it had the smallest Delta G132tot values (-17.14kT for silica gel and -21.84kT for CRA). The origins of Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis acid/base, and electrostatic interactions were discussed and related to experimental observations.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - The quorum-quenching lactonase from Bacillus thuringiensis is a metalloprotein.
AB  - Lactonases from Bacillus species hydrolyze the N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signaling molecules used in quorum-sensing pathways of many Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Erwinia carotovora, both significant pathogens. Because of sequence similarity, these AHL lactonases have been assigned to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily of proteins, which includes metalloenzymes of diverse activity, mechanism, and metal content. However, a recent study claims that AHL lactonase from Bacillus sp. 240B1 is not a metalloprotein [Wang, L. H., et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 13645]. Here, the gene for an AHL lactonase from Bacillus thuringiensis is cloned, and the protein is expressed, purified, and found to bind 2 equiv of zinc. The metal-bound form of AHL lactonase catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-hexanoyl-(S)-homoserine lactone but not the (R) enantiomer. Removal of both zinc ions results in loss of activity, and reconstitution with zinc restores activity, indicating the importance of metal ions for catalytic activity. Metal content, sequence alignments, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the zinc-containing lactonase all support a proposed dinuclear zinc binding site similar to that found in glyoxalase II.
TI  - Identification, cloning and expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ps-x putative urate oxidase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In a previous study we reported for the first time the isolation and characterization ofurate oxidase enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this work we isolated and cloned a 1.350 kilobase DNA fragment that encode a putative urate oxidase gene from the genomic library of P. aeruginosa Ps-x. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA insert revealed an open reading frame that encodes a protein of a molecular weight of 54.0 kDa. The cloned DNA fragment showed an uricolytic activity when expressed in E. coli DH5alpha. Surprisingly, the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene showed more than 99% identity to the gene encoding hypothetical protein of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Moreover, the sequence of the cloned gene was closely similar to the corresponding uricase gene of Cellulomonas flavigena (44% similarity), but showed lower similarity values to that of Bacillus sp. BT-90 (24% similarity), Candida utilis (24% similarity). Interestingly, the isolated uricase gene showed closer similarity to uricase from yeast-like symbiotic fungi Beauveria bassiana (35%), Tolypocladium inflatum (29%), Paecilomyces tenuipes (27%) and Cerataphis fransseni (24%).
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16.
AB  - The strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (Bac217; approximately 7 kDa). The onset of Bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively, when culture entered the early stationary phase. Biochemical characterization showed that Bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of pH 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees C for 6 months or -20 degrees C for up to 12 months. However, Bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. BGBUK2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. Plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for Bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. Bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Interestingly, Bac217 showed activity against Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853. The inhibitory effect of BGBUK2-16 on the growth of S. aureus in mixed culture was observed. S. aureus treatment with Bac217 led to a considerable decrease (CFU/ml) within a short period of time. The mode of Bac217 action on S. aureus was identified as bactericidal. It should be noted that the strain BGBUK2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.
TI  - Effect of surfactants on solubilization and degradation of phenanthrene under thermophilic conditions.
AB  - The bioavailability and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be increased through the addition of surfactants. Previous studies of this nature have been conducted under mesophilic conditions. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of synthetic surfactants and biosurfactants on solubilization and degradation of phenanthrene (PHE) in a series of batch solution experiments under thermophilic conditions. Tween 80, Triton X-100, and biosurfactants produced from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P-CG3 (P-CG3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (P. 9027) were used in this study. Surfactants effectively enhanced the solubility of PHE at 50 degrees C and the biosurfactant from P-CG3 was most effective with a 28-fold increase in apparent solubility of PHE at a concentration of 10 x critical micelle concentration (CMC) compared with the controls. However, addition of synthetic surfactants or biosurfactants inhibited the biodegradation of PHE in mineral salts medium by an isolate Bacillus sp. B-UM. Degradation of PHE diminished with increasing surfactant concentrations, and PHE degradation was completely inhibited for all the surfactants tested when the concentrations were greater than their respective CMC. The growth test suggested that Tween 80 and biosurfactants were degradable, but preferential utilization of these surfactants as substrates was not the mechanism for explaining the inhibition of PHE biodegradation. Because of the hydrophobic property of B-UM, degradation inhibition of PHE by surfactants was probably due to the reduction of direct contact between bacterial cells and PHE.
TI  - Use of heterotrophic CO2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  - We have examined whether assimilation of CO2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14CO2 and 13CO2 as tracers. Heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of CO2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Es. coli ATCC 13706, Rhodococcus ruber, Burkholderia sp., Bacillus circulans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analysis of 13C-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13CO2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. All major PLFAs extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13C after incubation with CO2. Between 1.4% and 6.5% of the biomass produced by cultures of P. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of CO2. Resting cells assimilated less CO2 compared to actively growing cells, and CO2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. The 14CO2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). On the basis of 14CO2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. The results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled CO2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation assays may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.
TI  - Nutrient composition and antimicrobial activity of sorrel drinks (soborodo).
AB  - Aqueous extracts (1,200 mL) of roselle calyx (40 g), fortified with either orange juice or pineapple juice as sweetener and lemon grass as flavorant (sorrel drink), were analyzed with regard to their mineral composition (Na, Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Ca), vitamin C content, and sensory evaluation. While the medicinal potentials were determined with respect to their inhibitory effect on the growth of Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus sp., and Corynebacterium sp. The results revealed that the roselle extract fortified with orange juice had higher vitamin C content than did those fortified with pineapple juice, while those fortified with pineapple juice had the best general acceptability. Zn, Na, and Ca were generally high in all the drinks; however, fortification with either pineapple or orange juice reduced the mineral content of the roselle extract. However, Pb, Cu, and Mn (toxic metals) were not detected. The antimicrobial effect of the unfortified roselle extract was low against the entire organism; however, fortification with pineapple juice and lemon grass greatly enhanced the inhibition of the growth of those organisms. They all had their highest inhibitory effect on the growth of P. aeruginosa. In view of the high Zn, Ca, Fe, Na, and vitamin C content as well as the antimicrobial activity, this cheaply produced drink from purely local materials could serve as a good replacement for expensive carbonated drinks.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
AB  - The metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the appearance of the final product. An aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (pH 9, 42 degrees C) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. This process was characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. The metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. The maximum degradation rate Vmax and the apparent Km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. Mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved CO2 and Cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). The active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as Bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3, 5, and 7.5 vol%), Bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhizobiaceae strain M100, and Achromobacter sp. LMG 5431 at 0.3 vol%.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Syzygium jambolanum seeds.
AB  - The water and methanolic extracts of Syzygium jambolanum seeds were examined for  antibacterial and antifungal activity in vitro using the disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration. Activity against gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus sp., Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseum) is discussed.
TI  - Relationships among ecology, demography and diseases of European bison (Bison bonasus).
AB  - The bison population in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland has now grown to approximately 300, while the herds in the Belarusian part of the forest total about 240 bison. The first signs of a health problem in these herds appeared in 1980, when two cases of balanoposthitis were detected in two bulls (2 and 5 years of age). Since 1980 research has been conducted to explain the cause of diseases, particularly balanoposthitis, and to monitor the health of bison in Bialowieza Forest. A total number of 614 bison (294 male and 320 female) of different ages was eliminated between 1980 and 2000. Not all the culled bison were examined (postmortem analysis, histopathological, bacteriological, virological and toxicological examinations, serological tests, molecular research). Based on the increase in numbers, reproduction in this population for the past 21 years is generally considered successful. Among 182 male bison eliminated during 1990-2000, only 85, or 47%, of the animals had balanoposthitis. Thus, the percentage of balanoposthitis cases went from 100% during the 1980s down to 47% in the past decade. It appears that the culling process has been a major factor leading to this decrease. It can be assumed that a set of factors is involved in the appearance of the disease (Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Ureoplasma spp, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptoccocus spp., Staphyloccocus spp.) while opportunistic infections including nematodes (Onchocerca spp.) are responsible for the occurrence of secondary lesions.
TI  - Reconfirmation of antimicrobial activity in the coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia fetida andrei by colorimetric assay.
AB  - A novel tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tet razolium (MTS) was used in the assessment of antimicrobial activity in earthworm in the presence of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) as an electron coupling reagent. This activity was purified from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECF), Eisenia fetida andrei (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae, annelids) using a series of column chromatography techniques and was tested against three Gram-negative strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and three Gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus megaterium, Arthrobacter sp., respectively. Only the pigment-free eluate of coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECFPE) showed activity against B. megaterium amongst three isolated active fractions. The anion (DEAE-52) exchange effluent of the ECFPE was reported to have the strongest activity against P. aeruginosa amongst the three active fractions. The 20% acetonitrile eluate (AE) by Sep-Pak C18 cartridge was also tested and showed fair resistance against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Arthrobacter sp., respectively.
TI  - Microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. It is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals. In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of AHL-producing and AHL-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. We showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter agglomerans, produced AHL signals. We also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., Agrobacterium tumefaciens XJ01, Bacillus cereus XJ08, and Ralstonia sp. XJ12, expressed AHL degradation enzymes. Furthermore, we showed that P. aeruginosa isolate HL43 was virulent against animal model Caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than P. aeruginosa strains PA01 and PA14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. These data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.
TI  - Meroterpenes from Penicillium sp found in association with Melia azedarach.
AB  - A Penicillium sp was isolated from the root bark of Melia azedarach and cultivated over sterilized rice. After chromatographic procedures, two meroterpenes, named preaustinoid A and B, were obtained in addition to the known alkaloid verruculogen. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic studies, and they exhibited moderate bacteriostatic effects on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp.
TI  - Pathogenic effects of bacteria isolated from larvae of Hylesia metabus Crammer (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae).
AB  - Hylesia metabus larvae are susceptible to several pathogens indigenous to the area in which they are found. Some larvae show symptoms characteristic of bacterial infection; they become flaccid and lethargic, and show a marked loss of appetite. We isolated and identified 29 bacterial strains from live, dead and experimentally infected H. metabus larvae, and evaluated their pathogenic activity. The bacteria which caused mortality in the larvae were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60-93.3%), Proteus vulgaris (20%), Alcaligenes faecalis, Planococcus sp. and Bacillus megaterium (10%), at doses of 3-4 x 10(7). Although P. aeruginosa is a well-known insect pathogen, this is the first report of its pathogenic activity on H. metabus. The potential risk to humans and low virulence make it unlikely that P. aeruginosa could be used in an augmentative biological control programme. However its natural incidence may be enhanced using parasites and predators of H. metabus as carriers.
TI  - [Antibiotic properties of the Pseudoalteromonas genus bacteria isolated from the  Black Sea water and molluscs].
AB  - Antagonistic properties of 41 strains of Alteromonas-like bacteria isolated from  the Black Sea water and molluscs have been studied. Being grown on the rich medium "B" for marine bacteria, 21% of strains have shown high antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi; 6% of strains inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans. Spectrum of antagonistic activity was essentially changed on synthetic "BM" medium with acetate, glutamate, alpha-alanine as a single source of carbon and was directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Culture liquids and acetone extracts of microbial biomass of 34% of the studied strains have shown activity against bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria. Strains producing the wide spectrum of antimicrobial substances (Alteromonas macleodii, Pseudoalteromonas citrea, P. haloplanktis, P. aurantia, Pseudoalteromonas sp.), fungicidal and algocidal substances have been found. Both extra- and intracellular metabolities of marine bacteria (including the pigments) were active.
TI  - Antifungal garcinia acid esters from the fruits of Garcinia atroviridis.
AB  - Two new garcinia acid derivatives, 2-(butoxycarbonylmethyl)-3-butoxycarbonyl-2-hydroxy-3-propanolide and 1',1"-dibutyl methyl hydroxycitrate, were isolated from the fruits of Garcinia atroviridis guided by TLC bioautography against the fungus Cladosporium herbarum. The structures of these compounds were established by spectral analysis. The former compound represents a unique beta-lactone structure and the latter compound is most likely an artefact of garcinia acid (= hydroxycitric acid). Both compounds showed selective antifungal activity comparable to that of cycloheximide (MID: 0.5 microg/spot) only against C herbarum at the MIDs of 0.4 and 0.8 microg/spot but were inactive against bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), other fungi (Alternaria sp., Fusarium moniliforme and Aspergillus ochraceous) including the yeast Candida albicans.
TI  - Genetically programmed autoinducer destruction reduces virulence gene expression  and swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - Virulence in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is controlled by cell density via diffusible signalling molecules ('autoinducers') of the N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) type. Two Bacillus sp. isolates (A23 and A24) with AHL-degrading activity were identified among a large collection of rhizosphere bacteria. From isolate A24 a gene was cloned which was similar to the aiiA gene, encoding an AHL lactonase in another Bacillus strain. Expression of the aiiA homologue from isolate A24 in P. aeruginosa PAO1 reduced the amount of the quorum sensing signal N-oxododecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone and completely prevented the accumulation of the second AHL signal, N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone. This strongly reduced AHL content correlated with a markedly decreased expression and production of several virulence factors and cytotoxic compounds such as elastase, rhamnolipids, hydrogen cyanide and pyocyanin, and strongly reduced swarming. However, no effect was observed on flagellar swimming or on twitching motility, and aiiA expression did not affect bacterial adhesion to a polyvinylchloride surface. In conclusion, introduction of an AHL degradation gene into P. aeruginosa could block cell-cell communication and exoproduct formation, but failed to interfere with surface colonization.
TI  - MHYT, a new integral membrane sensor domain.
AB  - MHYT, a new conserved protein domain with a likely signaling function, is described. This domain consists of six transmembrane segments, three of which contain conserved methionine, histidine, and tyrosine residues that are projected to lie near the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane. In Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, this domain forms the N-terminus of the sensor histidine kinase Slr2098. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several other organisms, the MHYT domain forms the N-terminal part of a three-domain protein together with previously described GGDEF and EAL domains, both of which have been associated with signal transduction due to their presence in likely signaling proteins. In Bacillus subtilis YkoW protein, an additional PAS domain is found between the MHYT and GGDEF domains. A ykoW null mutant of B. subtilis did not exhibit any growth alterations, consistent with a non-essential, signaling role of this protein. A model of the membrane topology of the MHYT domain indicates that its conserved residues could coordinate one or two copper ions, suggesting a role in sensing oxygen, CO, or NO.
TI  - Evaluation of extracts of the root of Landolphia owerrience for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Ethanolic and aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of Landolphia owerrience root parts (whole-root, root-bark and root-wood) were tested for activity against ten bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion and macro-broth dilution methods, respectively. The ethanolic extracts of the whole-root and root-wood were active against 100 and 80% of the test organisms, respectively. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root-bark were moderately active while the aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of the root-wood exhibited little or no activity. Out of the nine extracts prepared, 66.7% were active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, 55.6% variously against each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and local clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi, 44.4% against Proteus sp., 33.3% against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 and 22.2% against E. coli ATCC 11775. The agar-well-determined MIC values for the ethanolic whole-root extract (0.78-50 mg/ml) were higher (indicating lower activity) than the corresponding macro-broth-determined values (0.39-50 mg/ml) probably because of slow diffusion rates of the active constituents of the extract in agar. On the other hand, the differences could be due to the effects of DMSO used to dissolve the ethanolic extracts in the agar-well diffusion tests. Similar discrepancies in the MIC values detectable with the two test methods were apparent in the root-wood extract and the control drug, Gentamycin, except that in the latter the agar-well-determined MIC values (0.125-8.0 microg/ml) were lower than the macro-broth-determined values (0.125-64 microg/ml). The strong activity of the ethanolic extracts against known etiologic agents of diseases traditionally treated with L. owerrience root of similar preparations provides scientific justification for the use of the herb in ethnomedical practice in Nigeria.
TI  - nhaG Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene of Bacillus subtilis ATCC9372, which is missing in the complete genome sequence of strain 168, and properties of the antiporter.
AB  - We cloned a gene which enabled Escherichia coli mutant host cells lacking all of  the major Na(+)/H(+) antiporters to grow in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl from chromosomal DNA of Bacillus subtilis ATCC9372. An Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity was observed with membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli cells possessing the cloned gene, but not with vesicles from the host cells. Lithium ion was also a substrate for the antiporter. We sequenced the cloned DNA and found one open reading frame (designated nhaG) preceded by a promoter-like sequence and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and followed by a terminator-like sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of NhaG suggested that it consisted of 524 residues and that the calculated molecular mass was 58.1 kDa. None of the bacterial Na(+)/H(+) antiporters so far reported, except NhaP of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and SynNhaP (NhaS1) of Synechocystis sp., showed significant sequence similarity with the NhaG. However, the NhaP, the SynNhaP, animal NHEs (Na(+)/H(+) exchangers), and some hypothetical Na(+)/H(+) antiporters of several organisms showed significant sequence similarities with the NhaG. Interestingly, the entire DNA region corresponding to the nhaG gene is missing in the reported complete genome sequence of B. subtilis strain 168. We detected a band that hybridized with the nhaG DNA in chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis ATCC9372 but not with that from strain 168. The missing DNA region (1,774 base pairs) is sandwiched by two identical sequences, TTTTCTT.
TI  - [Correlation of 55 samples of contact lens fluid and direct swabbings of the eye  surface of symptomatic wearers of contact lenses].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological examination of contact lens storage solutions may reveal the etiological organisms responsible for keratitis and additionally harbour environmental contaminants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1998, conjunctival and corneal smears and scrapes, as well as the storage solutions of 55 soft contact lens wearers were examined microbiologically in a prospective non-randomised cohort study involving 53x unilateral and 2x bilateral cases of keraitis. RESULTS: In 42 of the in-use contact lens storage solutions, the following organisms were found: 8x Bacillus sp., 7x P. aeruginosa and 8x other pseudomonads, 6x Alcaligenes xylosans, 4x Serratia liquefaciens, 4x Enterobacter sp., 4x coagulase negative staphylococci, 3x Serratia marcescens, 3x S. aureus, 2x Streptococcus faecalis, 1x Klebsiella oxytoca and 5x Acanthameba. A significant correlation of ocular cultures was found for Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, S. aureus, S. faecalis and Acanthameba, but not for Bacillus, Alcaligenes, and coagulase negative staphylococci. Fungi were not found. The more pronounced the clinical picture, the more Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological examination of soft contact lens storage solutions of 55 keratitis patients confirmed that the microbes responsible were to be found in the fluid, in addition to environmental contaminants.
TI  - Reviewing efficacy of alternative water treatment techniques.
AB  - This section is designed to provide a brief summary of some of the findings. A good deal of work has been conducted by Mr N. L. Pavey and the team at BSRIA, Bracknell. The BSRIA publications are an excellent source of further information. Ultraviolet radiation: UV radiation of wavelength 254 nm destroys bacteria by a mechanism of damaging nucleic acids by producing thymine dimers which disrupt DNA replication [Gavdy and Gavdy, 1980]. L. pneumophila has been reported as sensitive to UV dosages of 2,500-7,000 uW.s/cm2 [Antopol & Ellner, 1979; Knudson, 1985]. Antopol and Ellner [1979] examined the susceptibility of L. pneumophila to UV dosage. Their results indicated that 50% of the organisms were killed by 380 uWs/cm2 and 90% were killed by 920 uWs/cm2. Kills of 99 and 99.9% were obtained using 1,840 and 2,760 uWs/cm2 respectively. Muraca et al [1987] showed that continuous UV irradiation resulted in a 5 logarithm decrease in waterborne L. pneumophila in a circulating system. Gilpin [1984] reported that in laboratory buffer solutions, exposure to 1 uW of UV radiation per cm2 achieved a 50% kill of L longbeachae in 5 minutes, L. gormanii in 2-30 minutes and L pneumophila in 17 minutes. Exposure times for 99% kills for L. longbeachae, L pneumophila and L. Gormanii were 33, 48 and 63 minutes respectively. The same research worker conducted experiments using a 3 litre circulating water system, connected to a stainless steel housing containing a UV source. The UV lamp output was 7 ergs/mm2 per second per 100 cm at 254 nm. L. pneumophila was killed within 15 seconds, that is within their first pass through the system. Continuous disinfection with UV has the advantages of imparting no taste, odour or harmful chemical by-products and requires minimal operation and maintenance [Muraca et al 1988]. Keevil et al [1989] state that UV irradiation fails to clear systems of biofilm because of poor penetration into microflocs of the micro-organisms. Copper/silver ionisation: A recent study of full scale hot water test rigs incorporating copper-silver ionisation systems has been reported by Pavey, 1996. Copper and silver ions were introduced into the water by electrolysis. One of the principal mechanisms of biocidal action of these ions is thought to be cell penetration. The positively charged copper ions form electrostatic bonds with negatively charged sites on the cell wall. The cell membrane is thus distorted, allowing ingress of silver ions which attack the cell by binding at specific sites to DNA, RNA, respiratory enzymes and cellular protein, causing catastrophic failure of the life support systems of the cell. Silver and copper ion concentrations of 40 and 400 ug/L respectively were effective against planktonic Legionellae in cold water systems and hot water systems containing soft water. In hard water, the ionisation was ineffective due to the inability to control silver ion concentrations. This was caused by scaling of the electrodes and silver ion complexation by the high concentration of dissolved solids. Bosch et al [1993] had earlier extended the application of copper-silver disinfection to human enteric viruses in water, such as adenovirus, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, and poliovirus. Their work showed that copper and silver ions in the presence of reduced levels of free chlorine did not ensure the total elimination of viral pathogens from water. In the case of an amoeba, Naegleria fowleria [responsible for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis], Cassells et al [1995] have demonstrated that a combination of silver and copper ions were ineffective at inactivating the amoebae at 80 and 800 ug/L respectively. However addition of 1.0 mg/L free chlorine produced a synergistic effect, with superior inactivation relative to either chlorine or silver-copper in isolation. A similar synergy was reported by Yahya et al [1989] in their study of Staphylococcus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Yahya et al [1992] also suggested an additive or synergistic effect in the inactivation of coliphage MS-2 and poliovirus. Other techniques: There are a number of other techniques. We have conducted trials of most of these in the control of Legionella sp., but these fall out of the scope of this article, and as such less emphasis has been placed on them here. Ozonation: Ozone [O3] is an oxidising gas, generated electrically from oxygen [O2]. L. pneumophila can be killed at < 1 mg/L of ozone [Edelstien et al 1982]. Muraca et al [1987] found that 1-2 mg/L of continuous ozone over a six hour contact time, produced a 5 logarithm decrease of L. pneumophila. The effectiveness of ozone treatment against a range of bacteria and coliphages has been studied Botzenhart et al [1993]. E. coli was least resistant to ozone, followed by MS 2-coliphage and PhiX 174-coliphage, with L. pneumophila and Bacillus subtilis spores being the most resistant. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
TI  - 16S rDNA-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by PCR and DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - PURPOSE: Establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. METHODS: From 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and DNA was extracted. Fragments of 200 bp, spanning the V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rDNA, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). For phylogenetic identification, DGGE bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16S rDNA clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. Sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the EMBL database. Furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from conventional cultivation. RESULTS: 16S rDNA could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. Sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. The following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: Staphylococcus (n = 8), Corynebacterium (n = 7), Propionibacterium (n = 7), Streptococcus (n = 6), Bacillus (n = 2), Acinetobacter (n = 3), Pseudomonas (n = 3), Proteus (n = 1), and Brevundimonas (n = 1). Four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. They had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of Pantoea and Enterobacter (n = 1), Kingella and Neisseria (n = 1), Serratia and Aranicola (n = 1), and Leuconostoc and Weissella (n = 2), respectively. Culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), Corynebacteria (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Streptococcus sp. (n = 1), Proteus sp. (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). In total, 45% of the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were PCR positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. No sample positive by culture gave negative results by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: 16S rDNA sequence analyses and DGGE fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - AiiA, an enzyme that inactivates the acylhomoserine lactone quorum-sensing signal and attenuates the virulence of Erwinia carotovora.
AB  - N-acylhomoserine lactones, known as autoinducers (AIs), are widely conserved signal molecules present in quorum-sensing systems of many gram-negative bacteria. AIs are involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions, including expression of pathogenic genes in the plant pathogens Pseudomonas solanacearum, several Erwinia species, and the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bacterial isolate, Bacillus sp. 240B1, is capable of enzymatic inactivation of AIs. The gene (aiiA) for AI inactivation from Bacillus sp. 240B1 has been cloned and shown to encode a protein of 250 amino acids. Sequence alignment indicates that AiiA contains a "HXHXDH" zinc-binding motif that is conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that conserved aspartate and most histidine residues are required for AiiA activity. Expression of aiiA in transformed Erwinia carotovora strain SCG1 significantly reduces the release of AI, decreases extracellular pectolytic enzyme activities, and attenuates pathogenicity on potato, eggplant, Chinese cabbage, carrot, celery, cauliflower, and tobacco. Our results indicate that the AI-inactivation approach represents a promising strategy for prevention of diseases in which virulence is regulated by AIs.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of extracts from arrabidaea bilabiata.
AB  - Consumption of Arrabidaea bilabiata fresh leaves produces a paraplegic syndrome in cattle. For isolation of the active principle, isopropanol and methanol extracts were prepared from the aerial parts of the plant; these were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg, orally, to determine the presence of substances affecting spontaneous motor activity. The isopropanol extract produced significant increases of long-pause and short-pause movements (112 and 54%, respectively). The methanol extract tended to increase motor activity, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. Chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the isopropanol extract showed allantoin was the major constituent. It was administered to rats, at doses of 1.2, 12, and 120 mg/kg. A complex dose-response curve was observed, but at the highest dose, there was a 52% increase in the number of long-pause movements. It was inferred that allantoin and the constituents of the alcholic extracts might not be responsible for the paraplegic synndrome in cattle. The alteration of cattle motor activity could be caused by other non-alcoholic constituents. Additionally, extracts were assayed for in vitro activity against Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumonae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus sp. and Candida albicans . All microbial strains were found to be resistant to the extracts with the exception of C. albicans , suggesting a possible antifungal activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Wedelia trilobata crude extracts.
AB  - A biological screening of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and fungi of crude extracts from Wedelia trilobata is reported. The n-hexane extract showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram-positive bacteria); along with Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella group C, Salmonella paratyphi, and Shigella sonnei (Gram-negative bacteria). The ethyl acetate extract was active only against Salmonella group C; and the aqueous extract was inactive against the tested bacteria. None of the tested extracts showed biological activity against the yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula rubra) or the fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp., Trichophyton rubrum).
TI  - The biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. Some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. The aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). The enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The induction of differentiation in HT-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Antibiotic properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilus and Streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion assay. Results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Three of the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. All the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. These results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.
TI  - Bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  - During mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. Using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. From the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were Streptococcus faecalis (S. faecalis; 38%), Escherichia coli (E. coli; 19%), Acinetobactor calcoaceticus (A. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), Micrococcus sp. (5%), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis; 5%) and Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris; 5%). From the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were S. faecalis (23%), A. calcoaceticus (23%), E. coli (15%), Micrococcus sp. (15%), B. subtilis (8%), P. vulgaris (4%), Staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). Gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. In both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. However, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. The vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. Consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. The levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (EU), respectively. It was undetectable in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 EU) and oviduct (2.2 EU) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. These results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.
TI  - An effective method for isolating alginate lyase-producing Bacillus sp. ATB-1015  strain and purification and characterization of the lyase.
AB  - A new alginate lyase-producing micro-organism, designated as Bacillus sp. strain  ATB-1015, was effectively isolated from soil samples pretreated for 3 months with a substrate of the enzyme, sodium alginate. Alginate lyase activity was assayed by the degrading activity of biofilm of Teflon sheet discs, which was formed by a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAM3 selected from clinical isolates. The extracellular alginate lyase was precipitated with ammonium sulphate from the culture broth, and purified by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. The molecular weight of the lyase was estimated to be 41 kDa by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sephacryl S-200 HR column chromatography. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme activity were around 7.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively, and the Km value was 0.17% with the substrate, sodium alginate. The lyase activity was completely inhibited by treatment with 1 mmol l-1 of EDTA and the decreased activity was almost completely recovered by the addition of 2 mmol l-1 of CaCl2. The activity was not affected by treatment with the protein denaturants, 0.01 mol l-1 of SDS or 1 mmol l-1 of urea. The lyase had substrate specificity for both the poly-guluronate and poly-mannuronate units in the alginate molecule.
TI  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  - Alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. One such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in Escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in E. coli and Pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in Alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in Pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in Photobacterium sp. strain SS9. Most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ECF sigma factors. They have also been characterized in Mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as Streptomyces coelicolor and Bacillus subtilus and the archaea Sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ECF factors belong to a subfamily of the sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. The promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ECF factors are also highly conserved. In most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in E. coli and in P. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. This inner membrane protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. Presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.
TI  - Biotransformation patterns of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by aerobic bacteria.
AB  - 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT), a toxic nitroaromatic explosive, accumulates in the  environment, making necessary the remediation of contaminated areas and unused materials. Although bioremediation has been utilized to detoxify TNT, the metabolic processes involved in the metabolism of TNT have proven to be complex. The three aerobic bacterial strains reported here (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus sp. , and Staphylococcus sp.) differ in their ability to biotransform TNT and in their growth characteristics in the presence of TNT. In addition, enzymatic activities have been identified that differ in the reduction of nitro groups, cofactor preferences, and the ability to eliminate-NO2 from the ring. The Bacillus sp. has the most diverse bioremediation potential owing to its growth in the presence of TNT, high level of reductive ability, and capability of removing-NO2 from the nitroaromatic ring.
TI  - Bacterial flavohaemoglobins: a consensus sequence and identification of a discrete enterobacterial group and of further bacterial globins.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of haemoglobin-like proteins from the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus subtilis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vitreoscilla sp. and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied. Phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis showed that the eubacterial group can be easily distinguished from the other haemoglobin-like proteins. The construction of a consensus bacterial flavohaemoglobin based on the alignment of six bacterial and one yeast globins allowed the design of consensus primers to search for haemoglobin-like genes in other bacteria. PCR products of the expected size were found in Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Hexavalent-chromium reduction by a chromate-resistant Bacillus sp. strain.
AB  - Bacillus strain QC1-2, isolated from a chromium-polluted zone, was selected by its high ability to both tolerate and reduce hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] to less-toxic trivalent chromium [Cr(III)]. Cell suspensions of strain QC1-2 rapidly reduced Cr(VI), in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, to Cr(III) which remained in the supernatant. Cr(VI) reduction was dependent on the addition of glucose but sulfate, an inhibitor of chromate transport, had no effect. Studies with permeabilized cells and cell extracts showed that the Cr(VI) reductase of strain QC1-2 is a soluble NADH-dependent enzyme.
TI  - Substrate specificities of bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerases and lipases: bacterial lipases hydrolyze poly(omega-hydroxyalkanoates).
AB  - The substrate specificities of extracellular lipases purified from Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Burkholderia cepacia (former Pseudomonas cepacia) and of extracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) depolymerases purified from Comamonas sp., Pseudomonas lemoignei, and P. fluorescens GK13, as well as that of an esterase purified from P. fluorescens GK 13, to various polyesters and to lipase substrates were analyzed. All lipases and the esterase of P. fluorescens GK13 but none of the PHA depolymerases tested hydrolyzed triolein, thereby confirming a functional difference between lipases and PHA depolymerases. However, most lipases were able to hydrolyze polyesters consisting of an omega-hydroxyalkanoic acid such as poly(6-hydroxyhedxanoate) or poly(4-hydroxybutyrate). The dimeric ester of hydroxyhexanoate was the main product of enzymatic hydrolysis of polycaprolactone by P. aeruginosa lipase. Polyesters containing side chains in the polymer backbone such as poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) and other poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) were not or were only slightly hydrolyzed by the lipases tested.
TI  - Microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are well recognized. The anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. The author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with HIV who presented between August 1990 and May 1994. METHODS: Review of records. RESULTS: Nine patients were women, and four were men. Mean age was 35.2 years. The keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. The most common infecting organism was Candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. Other organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in four, Bacillus sp in two, and one each Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Micrococcus sp, and Capnocytophaga sp. Seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. Classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. Twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. CONCLUSION: Infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic HIV infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. The prognosis for recovery of vision in these patients often is poor.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial otitis media in primary school children in Enugu Surburb, Enugu state, Nigeria.
AB  - Out of a total school population of 3,070 pupils examined for discharging ear due to bacterial etiology, 44 (1.4%) had discharging ear. Forty eight species of bacteria belonging to 5 genera were isolated. These included, Staphylococcus aureus, 16 isolates; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10; escherichia coli, 11; Proteus species, 7; Bacillus sp. 4. The highest prevalence of infection (3.0%) was recorded in central school Akwuke, Awkunanaw. Analysis of the data showed that infection rate was highest among the 6-9 year old age group (61%) and lowest among the 15 years and above age group (5%). Boys recorded a higher prevalence of infection (55%) than girls (45%). However the difference was not statistically significant (x = 2.08, p > 0.01). All the organisms isolated were sensitive to genticin but resistant to other commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Oceanapamine, a sesquiterpene alkaloid from the Philippine sponge Oceanapia sp.
AB  - The major metabolite of the Philippine sponge Oceanapia sp. is the antimicrobial  alkaloid oceanapamine [1], which was isolated as a trifluoroacetate salt. The structure and the absolute configuration of oceanapamine, which consists of a monocyclic sesquiterpene attached to a histamine residue, were elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data.
TI  - Survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (Ensete ventricosum).
AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from it on Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Fermented kocho (pH 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. The spent media from all of the four LAB, isolated from fermented kocho, namely Pediococcus sp, Leuconostoc sp, Lactobacillus sp and Streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the LAB isolates. In all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of pH.
TI  - Responses of diverse heterotrophic bacteria to elevated copper concentrations.
AB  - The influence of copper on the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus (three strains), and an unidentified Vibrio sp. was examined in batch cultures. The effects of copper at micromolar concentrations varied from undetectable to complete growth inhibition. Each strain was able to recover from a growth lag observed after copper addition at a characteristic concentration. Copper concentrations that allowed recovery ranged from 25 to 150 microM. Extracellular proteins in the medium of cultures that had recovered from copper stress were compared with those from control cultures. Protein profiles were analyzed for the presence of proteins similar to extracellular copper-binding proteins (CuBP) previously reported in V. alginolyticus. CuBP-like proteins were found in each Vibrio sp. examined. A protein of similar molecular mass was also detected in copper-stressed cultures of P. aeruginosa and not in control cultures. Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. did not produce CuBP-like proteins. The data show that CuBP-like proteins are not produced by all bacteria in response to copper stress and indicate that such proteins are common in marine Vibrio spp.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new heterocyclic structures: [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c] [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo [4', 5': 4,5] pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine.
AB  - Some derivatives of thiazolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine, pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[2,3-i]purine, [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4',5':4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1 (HSV-1), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Coxsackievirus B5 (CoxB5). The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses, mycetes and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited a modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for citrate synthase from a thermotolerant Bacillus sp.
AB  - The structural gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate Bacillus sp. strain C4 (ATCC 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at pH 5.0 to 7.0 in the presence of dolime has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. The nucleotide sequence of the entire 3.1-kb HindIII fragment has been determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsA). Citrate synthase from Bacillus sp. strain C4 was found to be a dimer (Mr, 84,500) with a subunit with an Mr of 42,000. The N-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. The kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. Bacillus sp. strain C4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by NADH, ATP, ADP, or AMP at levels up to 1 mM. The predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the E. coli, Acinetobacter anitratum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes.
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
TI  - Structure of the detoxification catalyst mercuric ion reductase from Bacillus sp. strain RC607.
AB  - Several hundred million tons of toxic mercurials are dispersed in the biosphere.  Microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (MerA). The latter, a homodimer with homology to the FAD-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction NADPH + Hg(II)----NADP+ + H+ + Hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates. Human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for FAD-dependent disulphide reductases and between its primary structure and that of MerA from Tn501 (Pseudomonas), Tn21 (Shigella), p1258 (Staphylococcus) and Bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved. All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini. Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp. strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. We report here the crystal structure of MerA from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp. strain RC607. Analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor Cd(II) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor. Knowledge of the mode of mercury ligation is a prerequisite for understanding this unique detoxification mechanism.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of pyrimido[2,1-b][1,3]thiazine, [1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]purine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d][1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives and thiazole analogues.
AB  - Some series of thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine, pyrimido[2,1-b] [1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[3,2-a]purine, [1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]purine, thiazolo[3,2-a][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d][1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives, variously functionalized, were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely: E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, S. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus Type 1, Vesicular stomatitis virus and Coxsackievirus B5. The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - Identification of a new operon involved in Listeria monocytogenes virulence: its  first gene encodes a protein homologous to bacterial metalloproteases.
AB  - The region flanking the transposon in a Tn1545-induced lecithinase-negative mutant of Listeria monocytogenes EGD was cloned and sequenced. The transposon had inserted in ORF D, the open reading frame previously identified downstream from hlyA, the gene encoding listeriolysin O. The complete sequence of ORF D from strain EGD has been determined as well as that of two other strains: LO28, a clinical isolate; and LM8, an epidemic strain. ORF D is 1,533 bp long and encodes a protein highly homologous to metalloproteases of bacilli, Serratia sp., Legionella pneumophila, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was renamed prtA. Northern RNA blot analysis indicated that prtA is the first gene of a 6-kb operon, suggesting that the lecithinase-negative phenotype of the mutant might be due to a polar effect of the transposon insertion.
TI  - Iodine sensitivity of bacteria isolated from iodinated water systems.
AB  - Fourteen bacterial isolates, predominantly Pseudomonas sp., from two water systems disinfected by iodinated anion-exchange resins were studied and compared with an isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a povidone-iodine solution and four other isolates. Pseudomonas cepacia and P. aeruginosa grown in brain heart infusion were 3 to 5 logs less sensitive to 1 mg/L I2 (pH 7.2, 1 min) when compared with cultures grown in phosphate buffer. Another P. cepacia isolate was the least sensitive culture when grown in brain heart infusion (1 log decrease) but was more sensitive after cultivation in phosphate buffer (5 logs). Isolates from an iodinated potable water system, including P. cepacia, Staphyloccus warneri, and a Bacillus sp., were all less sensitive to iodine than a "resistant" P. aeruginosa and three other isolates when grown in brain heart infusion. A clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa exhibited intermediate sensitivity. The sensitivity of bacteria to iodine is thus highly variable, depending on the organism as well as the growth conditions.
TI  - Thermophilic Bacillus sp. that shows the denitrification phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A thermophilic Bacillus sp. of marine origin was observed to grow anaerobically on nitrite, nitrous oxide (N2O) in the presence of nitrite, and N2O alone for a few hours after exhaustion of nitrite. This represents the second example of a denitrification phenotype originally observed to occur with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of three disinfectants after in-use stress.
AB  - Solutions of 2.0% and 3.4% glutaraldehyde, and of 0.5% phenate with 0.18% glutaraldehyde were stressed with a microbial and organic soil load for the periods advocated by the respective manufacturers. The disinfecting efficacy of the stressed solutions was challenged with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), a water Mycobacterium sp. and Candida albicans. The three disinfectants were active against the fast-growing bacteria in appropriate dilutions; lesser dilutions of the glutaraldehyde solutions killed the mycobacteria and the yeast, while stressed phenate with glutaraldehyde did not. One hour exposure of the stressed disinfectants failed to kill the spore preparations while reducing the number of survivors.
TI  - Thiosulfate oxidation by obligately heterotrophic bacteria.
AB  - Thiosulfate was oxidized stoichiometrically to tetrathionate during growth on glucose byKlebsiella aerogenes, Bacillus globigii, B. megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, two strains each ofP. fluorescens andP. aeruginosa, and anAeromonas sp. A gram-negative, rod-shaped soil isolate, Pseudomonad Hw, converted thiosulfate to tetrathionate during growth on acetate. None of the organisms could use thiosulfate as sole energy source. The quantitative recovery of all the thiosulfate supplied to heterotrophic cultures either as tetrathionate alone or as tetrathionate and unused thiosulfate demonstrated that no oxidation to sulfate occurred with any of the strains tested. Two strains ofEscherichia coli did not oxidize thiosulfate. Thiosulfate oxidation in batch culture occurred at different stages of the growth cycle for different organisms:P. putida oxidized thiosulfate during lag and early exponential phase,K. aerogenes oxidized thiosulfate at all stages of growth, andB. megaterium andAeromonas oxidized thiosulfate during late exponential phase. The relative rates of oxidation byP. putida andK. aerogenes were apparently determined by different concentrations of thiosulfate oxidizing enzyme. Thiosulfate oxidation byP. aeruginosa grown in chemostat culture was inducible, since organisms pregrown on thiosulfate-containing media oxidized thiosulfate, but those pregrown on glucose only could not oxidize thiosulfate. Steady state growth yield ofP. aeruginosa in glucose-limited chemostat culture increased about 23% in the presence of 5-22 mM thiosulfate, with complete or partial concomitant oxidation to tetrathionate. The reasons for this stimulation are unclear. The results suggest that heterotrophic oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate is widespread across several genera and may even stimulate bacterial growth in some organisms.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of the pyrenocines.
AB  - Pyrenocine A, a phytotoxin produced by Pyrenochaeta terrestris (Hansen) Gorenz, Walker and Larson, possesses general antibiotic activity against plants, fungi, and bacteria. Effective doses for 50% inhibition (ED50s) are 4 micrograms/mL for onion seedling elongation; 14, 20, 20, and 25 micrograms/mL for the germination of asexual spores of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, Mucor hiemalis, and Rhizopus stolonifer, respectively. Pyrenocine A also inhibits the linear mycelial growth of both P. terrestris and F. oxysporum with ED50s calculated as 77 and 54 micrograms/mL, respectively. Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to pyrenocine A than Gram-negative bacteria. ED50s are estimated as 30, 45, and 200 micrograms/mL for the inhibition of growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to those concentrations tested. Pyrenocine A acts primarily as a biostatic rather than a biocidal agent with all organisms tested showing some degree of recovery when released from pyrenocine A. Pyrenocines B and C show little antibiotic activity in the bioassays performed.
TI  - The nosocomial colonization of T. Bear.
AB  - A national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the National Institutes of Health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. The program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (T. Bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. One of the items used is a stuffed toy T. Bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. Considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the T. Bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. A prospective study of 39 sterilized T. Bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. Hospital acquired organisms cultured from the T. Bear included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, Corynebacterium acnes, Micrococcus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, and species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Aspergillus and others. Concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. Although the T. Bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.
TI  - A note on antibiotic resistance in the bacterial flora of raw sewage and sewage-polluted River Tigris in Mosul, Iraq.
AB  - Polluted water samples collected from the River Tigris in the vicinity of a raw sewage outfall were examined for the incidence of antibiotic resistance among coliform bacteria on three occasions during 1983. Eighty percent or more of the coliform bacteria were resistant to one or more antibiotics. At the same time, raw sewage samples were examined for the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were selected for sensitivity testing. Collectively, more than 90% of the 480 strains of the three organisms were resistant to one or more antibiotics. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin for twenty-nine strains including coliforms, E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., Ps. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., Micrococcus sp., Staph. aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus sp. from raw sewage and polluted River Tigris water was determined and that for Ps. aeruginosa was 250 micrograms/ml. The high incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in natural waters could be related to the widespread use of antibiotics in this locality.
TI  - Bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  - The membrane filter (MF) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified Endo medium at 35 degrees C for 22 h. Large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (SPC) technique, can interfere with the detection of coliforms on MF. This paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific SPC bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on MF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in Escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. The Flavobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. selected for this study from SPC did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. Excessive crowding of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae colonies on MF also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. Even when there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the E. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified Endo medium.
TI  - [Peptidases of preparations of proteolytic enzymes from several species of bacteria, molds and actinomycetes].
AB  - The activity of carboxy- and aminopeptidases of enzymic preparations obtained from bacteria Bacillus subtilis 1 M, 17, Bacillus mesentericus 100/26, 100/56, 16; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1/7a, 1/4; Bacillus thermophilicus S. sp. nov B-22, moulds Aspergillus oryzae 1-746, Aspergillus flavus 716 and actinomycete Streptomyces griseus 32-13 was studied. In the bacterial preparations the proteolytic activity was 1.5-2.5 times lower than in the fungal and actinomycete preparations. The carboxypeptidase activity of bacterial preparations was comparable with that of the moulds and by one order of magnitude lower than that of the actinomycete. The aminopeptidase activity of the bacterial preparations was different; however, it was comparable with that of the moulds and was higher than that in some cases. In the Streptomyces preparation the aminopeptidase activity was significantly higher than in the bacterial and fungal preparations. In most preparations Co2+ and Mn2+ influenced the activity of carboxy- and amino-peptidases. This suggests that these proteins can be referred to metal enzymes.

TI  - Distribution of the isopropylmalate pathway to leucine among diverse bacteria.
AB  - alpha-Isopropylmalate synthase and beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase activities  were detected in extracts of the following organisms: Chromatium D, Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, Hydrogenomonas H16, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Vibrio extorquens, Rhizobium japonicum, Alcaligenes viscolactis, Escherichia coli B, Proteus vulgaris, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Micrococcus sp., Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus polymyxa, Bacillus subtilis, and Nocardia opaca. The alpha-isopropylmalate synthase activity in these extracts was inhibited by low concentrations of l-leucine. Taken together with other data, these results suggest that the isopropylmalate pathway is widespread among organisms that can synthesize leucine.
TI  - Degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  - We have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Four of these cultures were identified as Aerobacter aerogenes, two as Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as Serratia killiensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus species. Another culture identified as P. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. When 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, A. aerogenes, B. subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens were able to grow. These five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. In all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. Induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of A. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, S. kiliensis, S. marcescens, B. subtilis, and Bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. Of these organisms, only Bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

TI  - Growth and survival of fuel isolates in hydrocarbon-fuel emulsions.
AB  - Two fuel utilizers, a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a Hormodendrum sp., and two fuel isolates which did not use fuel, Staphylococcus and Bacillus spp., were tested for ability to survive and grow in systems containing emulsified or nonemulsified forms of JP-4 jet fuel. Neither emulsion (Alamac no. 1 or Alamac no. 2) supported microbial growth without a water phase. Growth of P. aeruginosa in liquid systems containing either emulsion was not significantly different from growth in liquid systems with nonemulsified fuel. The Hormodendrum sp. grew well in a liquid medium containing nonemulsified JP-4, but when either of the emulsions served as carbon source no growth was observed. However, good growth was noted on spread plates with either emulsion. Viable cells of Bacillus sp. did not increase over a 4-day period, and Staphylococcus sp. did not survive in liquid systems containing JP-4 or emulsions.
