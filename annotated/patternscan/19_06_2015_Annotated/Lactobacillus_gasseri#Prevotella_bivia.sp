TI  == gene expression profiling of human vaginal cells in vitro discriminates compounds with pro-inflammatory and mucosa-altering properties: novel biomarkers for preclinical testing of hiv microbicide candidates.
AB  == background: inflammation and immune activation of the cervicovaginal mucosa are considered factors that increase susceptibility to hiv infection. therefore, it is essential to screen candidate anti-hiv microbicides for potential mucosal immunomodulatory/inflammatory effects prior to further clinical development. the  goal of this study was to develop an in vitro method for preclinical evaluation of the inflammatory potential of new candidate microbicides using a microarray gene expression profiling strategy. methods: to this end, we compared transcriptomes of human vaginal cells (vk2/e6e7) treated with well-characterized  pro-inflammatory (pic) and non-inflammatory (nic) compounds. pics included compounds with different mechanisms of action. gene expression was analyzed using affymetrix u133 plus 2 arrays. data processing was performed using genespring 11.5 (agilent technologies, santa clara, ca). results: microarraray comparative analysis allowed us to generate a panel of 20 genes that were consistently deregulated by pics compared to nics, thus distinguishing between these two groups. functional analysis mapped 14 of these genes to immune and inflammatory responses. this was confirmed by the fact that pics induced nfkb pathway activation in vk2 cells. by testing microbicide candidates previously characterized in clinical trials we demonstrated that the selected pic-associated genes properly identified compounds with mucosa-altering effects. the discriminatory power of these genes was further demonstrated after culturing vaginal cells with vaginal bacteria. prevotella bivia, prevalent bacteria in the  disturbed microbiota of bacterial vaginosis, induced strong upregulation of seven selected pic-associated genes, while a commensal lactobacillus gasseri associated to vaginal health did not cause any changes. conclusions: in vitro evaluation of  the immunoinflammatory potential of microbicides using the pic-associated genes defined in this study could help in the initial screening of candidates prior to  entering clinical trials. additional characterization of these genes can provide  further insight into the cervicovaginal immunoinflammatory and mucosal-altering processes that facilitate or limit hiv transmission with implications for the design of prevention strategies.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.
