TI  == [a case of empyema due to capnocytophaga sp. and actinomyces israelii].
AB  == a 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of cough, sputum production, and fever of 1 month's duration. his diabetes mellitus was poorly controlled, and his hemoglobin hba1c value was elevated at 10.9%. chest x-ray film and computed tomography scan showed bilateral but predominantly right-sided  pleural effusion. aspiration of the pleural fluid from the right-side showed frank pus, and empyema was diagnosed. capnocytophaga sp. and actinomyces israelii were isolated in the pleural effusion and were regarded as the pathogens causing  the empyema. klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in his sputum, and it may also have been a possible pathogen. the patient improved with administration of antibiotics (6 g/day ampicillin/sulbactam, 3 g/day ceftazidime hydrate and 1200 mg/day clindamycin) and chest tube drainage. he was discharged and regularly followed on an outpatient basis. we report this rare case of capnocytophaga sp. and actinomyces israelii as the pathogenic causes of empyema.
