TI  == presence of a new cytochrome b - like pigment with a peak at 567 nm in various aerobic bacteria.
AB  == several physiological groups of bacteria were examined for the presence of a cytochrome b - like pigment which is demonstrable in dithionite-reduced minus substrate-reduced difference spectra. this pigment is characterized by an unusually high alpha band at 567 nm, a low concentration relative to conventional cytochromes, and an inability to be fully reduced by endogenous substrates or nadh. previous studies with one denitrifying and nondenitrifying species of the genus pseudomonas, in paracoccus denitrificans, in alcaligenes faecalis, in azotobacter vinelandii, in branhamella catarrhalis, and in neisseria lactamicus.  in all these organisms, the peak of the 567-nm pigment is accompanied by a peak of about equal height at approximately 559 nm, which exhibits similar properties  to the 567-nm pigment. the 567-nm pigment was not demonstrable by this technique  in gluconobacter oxydans subspecies suboxydans, bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, aeromonas hydrophilia, escherichia coli, a klebsiella species, moraxella osloensis, aquaspirillum itersonii, micrococcus lysodeikticus, micrococcus luteus, agrobacterium tumefaciens, or rhizobium meliloti.
