TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == cultivable bacteria isolated from apple trees cultivated under different crop systems: diversity and antagonistic activity against colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
AB  == this study evaluated the diversity of cultivable plant growth-promoting (pgp) bacteria associated with apple trees cultivated under different crop management systems and their antagonistic ability against colletotrichum gloeosporioides. samples of roots and rhizospheric soil from apple trees cultivated in organic and conventional orchards in southern brazil were collected, together with soil samples from an area never used for agriculture (native field). bacteria were identified at the genus level by pcr-rflp and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna, and were evaluated for some pgp abilities. the most abundant bacterial genera identified were enterobacter (27.7%), pseudomonas (18.7%), burkholderia (13.7%),  and rahnella (12.3%). sixty-nine isolates presented some antagonist activity against c. gloeosporioides. in a greenhouse experiment, five days after exposure  to c. gloeosporioides, an average of 30% of the leaf area of plants inoculated with isolate 89 (identified as burkholderia sp.) were infected, whereas 60 to 73% of the leaf area of untreated plants was affected by fungal attack. our results allowed us to infer how anthropogenic activity is affecting the bacterial communities in soil associated with apple tree crop systems, and to obtain an isolate that was able to delay the emergence of an important disease for this culture.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == phosphate solubilization potential and modeling of stress tolerance of rhizobacteria from rice paddy soil in northern iran.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy soil in northern iran, and to study the effect of temperature, nacl and ph on the growth of these isolates by modeling. three of the most effective strains from a total of 300 isolates were identified and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out by 16s rdna  sequencing. the isolates were identified as pantoea ananatis (m36), rahnella aquatilis (m100) and enterobacter sp. (m183). these isolates showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity and indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. the m36, m100 and m183 isolates were able  to solubilize 172, 263 and 254 microg ml(-1) of ca3(po4)2 after 5 days of growth  at 28 degrees c and ph 7.5, and to produce 8.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mug ml(-1) of iaa when supplemented with l-tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) for 72 h, at 28 degrees c and ph 7.0, respectively. the solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associated with a drop in the ph of the culture medium and there was an inverse relationship between ph and solubilized p (r = -0.98, p < 0.0952). there were no significant differences among isolates in terms of acidity tolerance based on their confidence limits as assessed by segmented model analysis and all isolates were able to grow at ph 4.3-11 (with optimum at 7.0-7.5). based on a sigmoidal trend of a three-parameter logistic model, the salt concentration required for 50 % inhibition was 8.15, 6.30 and 8.23 % nacl for m36, m100 and m183 isolates, respectively. moreover, the minimum and maximum growth temperatures estimated by  the segmented model were 5.0 and 42.75 degrees c for m36, 12.76 and 40.32 degrees c for m100, and 10.63 and 43.66 degrees c for m183. the three selected isolates could be deployed as inoculants to promote plant growth in an agricultural environment.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == changes in the bacterial community and composition of fermentation products during ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages.
AB  == to gain further insights into temperate and tropical grass ensiling, fermentation products and bacterial communities were examined at both the initial and late stages of ensiling of wilted italian ryegrass and wilted guinea grass silages. 2,3-butanediol and ethanol fermentation were observed in wilted italian ryegrass  silage. enterobacteria such as rahnella sp. and enterobacter sp. may have been involved in fermentation; however, alcohol production was intensified after the silage enterobacterial community overwhelmed the pre-ensiled enterobacterial community. pediococcus spp. appeared in silage stored for 4 months, when a significant increase in lactic acid content was seen compared with that at 2 months. prolonged storage enhanced acetic acid fermentation in wilted guinea grass silage. the disappearance of enterococcus sulfureus and appearance of lactobacillus plantarum may have been associated with the increased acetic acid content. although many species of enterobacteria were found in common between the pre-ensiled crop and silages of italian ryegrass and guinea grass, marked differences were seen in the type of fermentation from the initial stages. these  results indicate that the bacterial community of pre-ensiled crops may be immediately replaced by one that is adapted to ensiling environments, although metabolic changes may continue over the course of ensiling.

TI  == reversible oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase carried by free-living n2-fixing bacteria  isolated from the rhizospheres of rice, maize, and wheat.
AB  == hydrogen production by microorganisms is often described as a promising sustainable and clean energy source, but still faces several obstacles, which prevent practical application. among them, oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenases represents one of the major limitations hampering the biotechnological implementation of photobiological production processes. here, we describe a hierarchical biodiversity-based approach, including a chemochromic screening of hydrogenase activity of hundreds of bacterial strains collected from several ecosystems, followed by mass spectrometry measurements of hydrogenase activity of a selection of the h(2)-oxidizing bacterial strains identified during the screen. in all, 131 of 1266 strains, isolated from cereal rhizospheres and basins containing irradiating waste, were scored as h(2)-oxidizing bacteria, including pseudomonas sp., serratia sp., stenotrophomonas sp., enterobacter sp., rahnella sp., burkholderia sp., and ralstonia sp. isolates. four free-living n(2)-fixing bacteria harbored a high and oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase activity, which was not  fully inhibited within entire cells up to 150-250 mumol/l o(2) concentration or within soluble protein extracts up to 25-30 mumol/l. the only hydrogenase-related genes that we could reveal in these strains were of the hyc type (subunits of formate hydrogenlyase complex). the four free-living n(2)-fixing bacteria were closely related to enterobacter radicincitans based on the sequences of four genes (16s rrna, rpob, hsp60, and hyce genes). these results should bring interesting prospects for microbial biohydrogen production and might have ecophysiological significance for bacterial adaptation to the oxic-anoxic interfaces in the rhizosphere.

TI  == evaluation of the role of carnobacterium piscicola in spoilage of vacuum- and modified-atmosphere-packed cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees c.
AB  == the microflora on spoiled cold-smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and gram-negative bacteria. to elucidate the role of the different groups, a storage trial was carried out in which nisin and co2 were used for the selective inhibition of the two bacterial groups. the shelf-life of  vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon, recorded by sensory evaluation, was four weeks  at 5 degrees c and the microflora was composed of lab (10(6)-10(7) cfu/g) with an associate gram-negative flora in varying levels (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g). the addition of nisin and/or a co2-atmosphere increased the shelf-life to five or six weeks and limited the level of lab to about 10(4)-10(6), 10(3)-10(6) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g, respectively. co2-atmosphere +/- nisin inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria, whereas nisin had no effect on these in vacuum packages.  the gram-negative flora on vacuum-packed salmon was dominated by a vibrio sp., resembling v. marinus, enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter agglomerans, serratia liquefaciens and rahnella aquatilis) and occasionally aeromonas hydrophila. irrespective of the addition of nisin and/or co2-atmosphere, the lab microflora was dominated by carnobacterium piscicola, which was found to account for 87% of  the 255 lab isolates characterized. whole-cell-protein patterns analysed by sds-page confirmed the carnobacterium species identification. the spoilage potential of c. piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx.  10(6) cfu/g in cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees c. the salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum- or co2-atmosphere, and it is concluded that  despite high levels (> 10(7) cfu/g) of c. piscicola, sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes. this was supported by the development of soft texture and sour, rancid and bitter off-flavours at the point of spoilage, irrespective of the length of shelf-life and low or high total counts of lab and gram-negative bacteria.
