TI  - Characterization, identification and application of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  - There has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. This study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in China. One hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be LAB based on their Gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. These isolates were divided into eight groups (A-H) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. The Group A to H strains were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), L. casei (5.1%), Leuconostoc (Ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), Pediococcus (P.) pentosaceus (24.2%), Enterococcus (E.) mundtii (12.1%), Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae (15.2%), E. faecium (9.1%) and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16S rRNA and recA genes. P. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the LAB population in the paddy rice silage. A selected strain, namely L. casei R 465, was found to be able to grow under low pH conditions and to improve the silage quality with low pH and a relatively high content of lactic acid. This study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant LAB species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with LAB, and that strain R 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.
TI  - Pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from Northwestern Argentina.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from Northwestern Argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at Maimara (chicha M) and Tumbaya (chicha T). Whereas by culture-dependent approach a few number of species (Lactobacillus plantarum and Weissella viridescens in chicha M, and Enterococcus faecium and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha T) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. The relative abundance of OTUs was higher in chicha M than in chicha T; six LAB genera were common for chicha M and T: Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus while Pediococcus only was detected in chicha M. Among the 46 identified LAB species, those of Lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas Enterococcus and Leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha T and M, respectively. Identification at species level showed the predominance of Lb. plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Leuconostoc lactis and W. viridescens in chicha M while Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium, Lc. mesenteroides and Weissella confusa predominated in chicha T samples. In parallel, when presumptive LAB isolates (chicha M: 146; chicha T: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by ISR-PCR and RAPD-PCR profiles, species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the Leuconostoc genus (Lc. mesenteroides and Lc. lactis) in chicha M, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus being also present. In contrast, chicha T exhibited the presence of Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, E. faecium being the most representative species. Massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. Although differences in the LAB species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant LAB species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. The fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on LAB population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria from traditional cheese in Khorramabad city of Iran with probiotic potential.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with proteolitic activity are used as aromatic and antibacterial substances, cholesterol reduces, bile salt hydrolyses, and probiotic. The aims of this project were to isolate and identify natural LAB flora involved in traditional fermentation in cheeses of Khoramabad city and also to survey their probiotic potential. In order to achieve this goal, LAB were isolated and characterized using phenotypic and genotypic methods (PCR-sequencing); in the next stage, they were analyzed lowering cholesterol medium, hydrolysis of the bile, resistance to bile-resistant PH acidic stomach. At the end of the study, 88 cocci and 3 bacill were found: 58 Enterococcus faecium, 16 Enterococcus hirae, 5 Lactococcus lactis, 3 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 9 undetermined. The probiotic results of the bacteria had effects on the reduction of cholesterol, resistance to stomach acid, had relative antibacterial effects, and some strains had effects on hydrolyzing the bile. For further identification, the PCR method and the application of 16s-DNA-ITS genes and its sequencing were found useful. This study showed that lactic acid bacteria in the traditional cheese of the Khorramabad city have relative probiotic effect and that these lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk are suitable.
TI  - Effect of microbial inoculants on the quality and aerobic stability of bermudagrass round-bale haylage.
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of using 4 commercially available microbial inoculants to improve the fermentation and aerobic stability of bermudagrass haylage. We hypothesized that the microbial inoculants would increase the fermentation and aerobic stability of the haylages. Bermudagrass (4-wk regrowth) was harvested and treated with (1) deionized water (control); (2) Buchneri 500 (B500; Lallemand Animal Nutrition, Milwaukee, WI) containing 1x10(5) of Pediococcus pentosaceus and 4x10(5) of Lactobacillus buchneri 40788; (3) Biotal Plus II (BPII; Lallemand Animal Nutrition) containing 1.2x10(5) of P. pentosaceus and Propionibacteria freudenreichii; (4) Silage Inoculant II (SI; AgriKing Inc., Fulton, IL) containing 1x10(5) of Lactobacillus plantarum and P. pentosaceus; and (5) Silo King (SK; AgriKing Inc.), containing 1x10(5) of L. plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, and P. pentosaceus, respectively. Forty round bales (8 per treatment; 441+/-26kg; 1.2x1.2 m diameter) were made and each was wrapped with 7 layers of plastic. Twenty bales were stored for 112 d and the remaining 20 were stored for 30 d and sampled by coring after intermediary storage periods of 0, 3, 7, and 30 d. The pH of control and inoculated haylages sampled on d 3 did not differ. However, B500 and BPII had lower pH (5.77+/-0.04 vs. 6.16+/-0.04; 5.06+/-0.13 vs. 5.52+/-0.13) than other treatments by d 7 and 30, respectively. At final bale opening on d 112, all treatments had lower pH than the control haylage (4.77+/-0.07 vs. 5.37+/-0.07). The B500, BPII, and SI haylages had greater lactic acid and lactic-to-acetic acid ratios than SK and control haylages. No differences were detected in neutral detergent fiber digestibility, dry matter losses, dry matter, lactic and acetic acid concentrations, and yeast and coliform counts. The SK haylage had lower clostridia counts compared with the control (1.19+/-0.23 vs. 1.99+/-0.23 cfu/g). Treatments B500, BPII, SI, and SK tended to reduce mold counts and they improved aerobic stability by 236, 197, 188, and 95%, respectively, compared with the control (276+/-22 vs. 99+/-22h).
TI  - Construction of a novel inducible expression vector for Lactococcus lactis M4 and Lactobacillus plantarum Pa21.
AB  - A vector that drives the expression of the reporter gusA gene in both Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis was constructed in this study. This vector contained a newly characterized heat shock promoter (Phsp), amplified from an Enterococcus faecium plasmid, pAR6. Functionality and characterization of this promoter was initially performed by cloning Phsp into pNZ8008, a commercial lactococcal plasmid used for screening of putative promoters which utilizes gusA as a reporter. It was observed that Phsp was induced under heat, salinity and alkaline stresses or a combination of all three stresses. The newly characterized Phsp promoter was then used to construct a novel Lactobacillus vector, pAR1801 and its ability to express the gusA under stress-induced conditions was reproducible in both Lb. plantarum Pa21 and L. lactis M4 hosts.
TI  - Effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on ruminal pH, volatile fatty acids and bacterial flora of Holstein calves.
AB  - Twelve ruminally cannulated Holstein calves (age, 12 +/- 3 weeks) were used to identify the effect of a probiotic comprised of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium butyricum on ruminal components. The calves were adapted to a diet containing a 50% high-concentrate (standard diet) for 1 week, and then, the probiotic was given once daily for 5 days (day 1-5) at 1.5 or 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to groups of four calves each. Four additional calves fed the standard diet without probiotic served as the corresponding control. Ruminal pH was measured continuously throughout the 15-day experimental period. Ruminal fluid was collected via a fistula at a defined time predose and on days 7 and 14 to assess volatile fatty acid (VFA), lactic acid and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations, as well as the bacterial community. The probiotic at either dose improved the reduced 24-hr mean ruminal pH in calves. The circadian patterns of the 1 hr mean ruminal pH were identical between the probiotic doses. In both probiotic groups, ruminal lactic acid concentrations remained significantly lower than that of the control. Probiotic did not affect ruminal VFA concentrations. L. plantarum and C. butyricum were not detected in the rumen of calves given the high-dose probiotic, whereas Enterococcus spp. remained unchanged. These results suggest that calves given a probiotic had stable ruminal pH levels (6.6-6.8), presumably due to the effects of the probiotic on stabilizing rumen-predominant bacteria, which consume greater lactate in the rumen.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - [Identification and biological properties of intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from aged women].
AB  - The strains of lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from the intestine of older women. These strains were identified and their biological activity was studied. It has been established that Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. salivarius var. salivarius and Enterococcus faecium had the highest antagonistic activity against opportunistic microorganisms. It has been revealed, that the adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of the tested cultures had strain specificity. Most of the isolates were highly adhesive and did not produce hemolysins.
TI  - In vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Portuguese fermented meat products.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. Bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. The objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum ST202Ch and ST216Ch, Enterococcus faecium ST211Ch, and Lactobacillus sakei ST22Ch, ST153Ch and ST154Ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. Auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were recorded for L. sakei ST22Ch, ST153Ch and ST154Ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for L. plantarum ST202Ch and ST216Ch, respectively, and 12.77% for E. faecium ST211Ch. Various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for Listeria monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for E. faecium ATCC 19443 were observed. According to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. In addition, the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs was examined. Production of beta-galactosidase by L. sakei ST22Ch, ST153Ch and ST154Ch, L. plantarum ST202Ch and ST216Ch, and E. faecium ST211Ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranose. A statistically significant (P<0.001) inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by L. plantarum ST202Ch (38.3%) and ST216Ch (48.6%), L. sakei ST153Ch (16.2%) and ST154Ch (16.1%), and E. faecium ST211Ch (21.7%) was observed. As determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.
TI  - Immune-stimulatory effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on peripheral leukocyte  subpopulations and cytokine mRNA expression levels in scouring holstein calves.
AB  - Subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes and cytokine mRNA expression levels were  evaluated in scouring and healthy Holstein calves (age 10 +/- 5 days; n=42) treated with a probiotic consisting of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium butyricum. The calves were assigned to the scouring or healthy group and then subdivided into pathogen-positive treated (n=8), pathogen-positive control (n=8), pathogen-negative treated (n=6), pathogen-negative control (n=6), healthy treated (n=6) and healthy control (n=8) groups. A single dose of the probiotic (3.0 g/100 kg body weight) was given to each calf in the treatment groups for 5 days. Blood samples were collected on the first day of scour occurrence (day 0) and on day 7. In the scouring calves, smaller peripheral leukocyte subpopulations and cytokine mRNA expression levels were noted on day 0. The numbers of CD3(+) T cells; CD4(+), CD8(+) and WC1(+) gammadelta T cell subsets; and CD14(+), CD21(+) and CD282(+) (TLR2) cells were significantly increased in the scouring and healthy treated calves on day 7. Furthermore, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma mRNA expression was elevated in the peripheral leukocytes of the scouring and healthy treated calves on day 7. The scouring calves given the probiotic recovered on day 7. A significantly smaller number of peripheral leukocytes and lower cytokine mRNA expression level might be induced by scouring in calves. Repeated probiotic administration might stimulate cellular immunity and encourage recovery from scouring in pre-weaning Holstein calves.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes  and their cytokine mRNA expression in calves.
AB  - Eight Holstein calves (10 +/- 3 weeks) were used to examine the interaction between a bacteria-based probiotic agent (probiotic) and the function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The probiotic, consisting of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium butyricum, was administered orally at 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to calves once daily for 5 consecutive days. Calves given the vehicle alone with no probiotic served as the control. In the treatment group, increases in numbers of CD282(+) (TLR2) monocytes, CD3(+) T cells and CD4(+), CD8(+) and WC1(+) gammadelta T cell subsets were noted on day 7 post-placement compared to predose day and the control group. Expression of interleukin (IL)-6, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was elevated in peripheral leukocytes on days 7 and 14. These results suggest that peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy calves may be stimulated via the gastrointestinal microbiota, which was increased by the oral probiotic treatment, with overall stability of the rumen bacterial flora. The 5-day repeated administration of a bacteria-based probiotic may enhance cellular immune function in weaned calves.
TI  - Ability of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mink to remove cholesterol: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - This study evaluated the cholesterol-lowering property of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from mink. Two strains, Enterococcus faecium MDF1104 and Lactobacillus plantarum MDL1118, were shown to remove cholesterol from broths of natural hen egg yolk and skimmed milk. The cholesterol in hen egg yolk was reduced by 58.15% and 38% by L. plantarum and E. faecium, respectively. When the bacteria were used in combination, 48.95% (p < 0.01) of cholesterol was removed from skimmed milk. Experimental mice remained healthy when fed different doses of the LAB, and the total serum cholesterol concentration was the lowest (0.90 mmol/L) (p < 0.01) when a combination of L. plantarum and E. faecium was used. Based on our results, we suggest that L. plantarum MDL1118, E. faecium MDF1104, or a combination of the 2 strains could be considered as promising cholesterol-lowering probiotics.
TI  - Effects of 8 chemical and bacterial additives on the quality of corn silage.
AB  - This project aimed to evaluate the effects 8 additives on the fermentation, dry matter (DM) losses, nutritive value, and aerobic stability of corn silage. Corn forage harvested at 31% DM was chopped (10mm) and treated with (1) deionized water (control); (2) Buchneri 500 (BUC; 1x10(5) cfu/g of Pediococcus pentosaceus 12455 and 4x10(5) cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri 40788; Lallemand Animal Nutrition, Milwaukee, WI); (3) sodium benzoate (BEN; 0.1% of fresh forage); (4) Silage Savor acid mixture (SAV: 0.1% of fresh forage; Kemin Industries Inc., Des Moines, IA); (5) 1x10(6) cfu/g of Acetobacter pasteurianus-ATCC 9323; (6) 1x10(6) cfu/g of Gluconobacter oxydans-ATCC 621; (7) Ecosyl 200T (1x10(5) cfu/g of Lactobacillus plantarum MTD/1; Ecosyl Products Inc., Byron, IL); (8) Silo-King WS (1.5x10(5) cfu/g of L. plantarum, P. pentosaceus and Enterococcus faecium; Agri-King, Fulton, IL); and (9) Biomax 5 (BIO; 1x10(5) cfu/g of L. plantarum PA-28 and K-270; Chr. Hansen Animal Health and Nutrition, Milwaukee, WI). Treated forage was ensiled in quadruplicate in mini silos at a density of 172 kg of DM/m(3) for 3 and 120 d. After 3 d of ensiling, the pH of all silages was below 4 but ethanol concentrations were least in BEN silage (2.03 vs. 3.24% DM) and lactic acid was greatest in SAV silage (2.97 vs. 2.51% DM). Among 120-d silages, additives did not affect DM recovery (mean=89.8% +/- 2.27) or in vitro DM digestibility (mean=71.5% +/- 0.63). The SAV silage had greater ammonia-N (0.85 g/kg of DM) and butyric acid (0.22 vs. 0.0% DM) than other treatments. In contrast, BEN and Silo-King silages had the least ammonia-N concentration and had no butyric acid. The BEN and A. pasteurianus silages had the lowest pH (3.69) and BEN silage had the least ethanol (1.04% DM) and ammonia nitrogen (0.64 g/kg DM) concentrations, suggesting that fermentation was more extensive and protein degradation was less in BEN silages. The BUC and BIO silages had greater acetic acid concentrations than control silages (3.19 and 3.19 vs. 2.78% DM), but yeast counts did not differ. Aerobic stability was increased by 64% by BUC (44.30 h) and by 35% by BEN (36.49 h), but other silages had similar values (27.0+/-1.13 h).
TI  - Aerobic deterioration stimulates outgrowth of spore-forming Paenibacillus in corn silage stored under oxygen-barrier or polyethylene films.
AB  - The occurrence of Bacillus and Paenibacillus spores in silage is of great concern to dairy producers because their spores can survive pasteurization and some strains are capable of subsequently germinating and growing under refrigerated conditions in pasteurized milk. The objectives of this study were to verify the role of aerobic deterioration of corn silage on the proliferation of Paenibacillus spores and to evaluate the efficacy of oxygen-barrier films used to cover silage during fermentation and storage to mitigate these undesirable bacterial outbreaks. The trial was carried out on whole-crop maize (Zea mays L.) inoculated with a mixture of Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Enterococcus faecium. A standard polyethylene film and a polyethylene-polyamide film with an enhanced oxygen barrier were used to produce the silage bags for this experiment. The silos were stored indoors at ambient temperature (18 to 22 degrees C) and opened after 110 d. The silage was sampled after 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, and 14 d of aerobic exposure to quantify the growth of endospore-forming bacteria during the exposure of silages to air. Paenibacillus macerans (gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic bacteria) was able to develop during the aerobic exposure of corn silage. This species was present in the herbage at harvesting, together with clostridial spores, and survived ensiling fermentation; it constituted more than 60% of the anaerobic spore formers at silage opening. During silage spoilage, the spore concentration of P. macerans increased to values greater than 7.0 log10 cfu/g of silage. The use of different plastic films to seal silages affected the growth of P. macerans and the number of spores during aerobic exposure of silages. These results indicate that the number of Paenibacillus spores could greatly increase in silage after exposure to air, and that oxygen-barrier films could help to reduce the potential for silage contamination of this important group of milk spoilage microorganisms by delaying the onset of aerobic deterioration.
TI  - Technological and safety properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Spanish dry-cured sausages.
AB  - Technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in lactic acid bacteria isolated from Spanish dry-cured sausages in order to select them as starter cultures. In relation to technological properties, all the strains showed significative nitrate reductase activity; Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and 52% of the Enterococcus faecium strains showed lipolytic activity and only Lactobacillus sakei strains (43%) were able to form biofilms. Related to safety aspects, E. faecium strains were the most resistant to antibiotics, whereas, L. sakei strains were the most sensitive. In relation to virulence factors, in the E. faecium strains analyzed, only the presence of efaA gene was detected. The analysis of biogenic amine production showed that most E. faecium strains and L. sakei Al-142 produced tyramine. In conclusion, L. paracasei Al-128 and L. sakei Al-143 strains possess the best properties to be selected as adequate and safe meat starter cultures.
TI  - Taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a Ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  - Produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in Ghana and other parts of West Africa. Despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many Africans, there is currently only limited information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. With the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the Upper East region of Ghana, namely Bolgatanga, Paga and Navrongo, was carried out. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts associated with nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (GTG)5-based rep-PCR, multiplex PCR, and 16S and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. The LAB counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. Lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant LAB throughout the fermentations with Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides playing prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. Less frequently isolated LAB included Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus italicus, Weissella confusa and a putatively novel Lactococcus spp. The yeasts involved were identified as Candida parapsilosis, Candida rugosa, Candida tropicalis, Galactomyces geotrichum, Pichia kudriavzevii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with P. kudriavzevii and S. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.
TI  - Influence of autochthonous adjunct cultures on ripening parameters of Argentinean goat's milk cheeses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Argentinean semi-hard goat's cheeses manufactured with and without the addition of autochthonous adjunct cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum ETC17, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ETC14 and Enterococcus faecium ETC3 were analysed to evaluate the effect of these strains on ripening parameters. RESULTS: Gross composition was similar among cheeses. Microbiological analysis indicated that lactic acid bacteria added to cheeses reached high levels. None of the strains assayed affected the primary proteolysis. Overall, E. faecium had a clearer effect on the peptide and lipolysis profiles of cheeses. Analysis of the volatile fraction of cheeses indicated that the levels of several compounds involved in the overall flavour of goat's cheeses were affected by the presence of E. faecium. This could explain the differences detected in the global perception of cheeses made with this strain compared with control cheeses. CONCLUSION: The present work represents a first contribution to knowledge of the ripening process of Argentinean goat's cheeses made with the addition of autochthonous adjunct cultures. The results suggest that E. faecium ETC3 showed a significant effect during ripening, which was reflected both in the profiles of proteolysis, lipolysis and volatile compounds and in the global sensory perception of cheeses.
TI  - Isolation and identification of bacteriocinogenic strain of Lactobacillus plantarum with potential beneficial properties from donkey milk.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to isolate and characterize a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from donkey milk with potential beneficial properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from donkey milk and identified based on physiological, biochemical and molecular methods. The isolate that presented highest bacteriocin potential (Lactobacillus plantarum LP08AD) was evaluated for the production of bacteriocin, including stability in the presence of various enzymes, surfactants, salts, pH and temperatures. Bactericidal effect of bacteriocin LP08AD on Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus curvatus was shown for actively growing and stationary cells. Similar growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain LP08AD was cultured in MRS broth at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Bacteriocin LP08AD adhered at low levels on the producer cells (200 AU ml(-1) ). The presence of plantaricin W gene on the genomic DNA was recorded based on PCR. Good growth for strain LP08AD was recorded in MRS broth with pH from 5.0 to 9.0 and LP08AD grew well in the absence of oxbile or concentration below 0.8%. Lact. plantarum LP08AD was applied to the small intestinal epithelial polarized monolayers of H4, PSIc1 and CLAB and demonstrated low attachment ability on all cell lines studied, with values with a similar behaviour for cells from human and pig origin. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocin-producing Lact. plantarum LP08AD might be useful in the design of novel functional foods with potential probiotic or biopreservation properties. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and characterization of bacteriocinogenic Lact. plantarum from donkey milk. The strain LP08AD shows to have potential beneficial properties, as demonstrated by the use of noncancerogenic cell lines.
TI  - Effects of dietary supplementation of citrus by-products fermented with a probiotic microbe on growth performance, innate immunity and disease resistance against Edwardsiella tarda in juvenile olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (Temminck & Schlegel).
AB  - Two consecutive studies were conducted to evaluate the dietary supplementation of citrus by-products (CB) fermented with probiotic bacteria on growth performance, feed utilization, innate immune responses and disease resistance of juvenile olive flounder. In Experiment I, five diets were formulated to contain 0% (control) or 3% four different CB fermented with Bacillus subtilis (BS), Enterococcus faecium (EF), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) and L. plantarum (LP) (designated as CON, CBF-BS, CBF-EF, CBF-LR and CBF-LP, respectively). During 10 weeks of a feeding trial, growth performance and feed efficiency were not significantly different among all the fish groups. However, fish fed CBF containing diets had significantly higher survivals than the CON group. Disease resistance of fish against Edwardsiella tarda was increased by the fermentation of CB. In Experiment II, we chose the BS as a promising probiotic and formulated five diets to contain 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% CBF-BS. Growth performance was not significantly affected by the CBF-BS supplementation during 6 weeks of a feeding trial. Innate immunity of fish was significantly enhanced by CBF-BS supplementation. Myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities were increased in a dose-dependent manner by dietary CBF-BS inclusions. In a consecutive challenge test against E. tarda, an increased disease resistance was found by CBF-BS supplementation. These studies indicate that the fermentation process of CB with probiotic has beneficial effects on innate immunity and thereby increases disease resistance of olive flounder against E. tarda. Bacillus subtilis can be used as a promising probiotic microbe for by-product fermentation in fish feeds.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic strains for development of fermented Alisma canaliculatum and their effects on broiler chickens.
AB  - The present study was conducted to select appropriate microbial strains for the development of fermented Alisma canaliculatum A. Br. et Bouche (FAC) feed additive and to examine their effects on broilers. In experiment 1, 16 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) were evaluated. The strains were tested for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance levels. Among them, L. acidophilus KCTC 3111, E. faecium KCTC 2022, B. subtilis KCTC 3239, and S. cerevisiae KCTC 7928 were selected to produce FAC. For experiment 2, 140 Ross broiler chicks were allocated to four 5-wk-long dietary groups: NC (basal diet), PC (basal diet with 0.005% oxytetracycline), AC (basal diet with 0.5% A. canaliculatum rhizome powder), and FAC (basal diet with 0.5% FAC). Final BW and total BW gain were increased (P < 0.05) upon the addition of FAC, whereas feed conversion ratio improved (P < 0.05) in the supplemented groups compared with the NC group. Crude protein content increased and crude fat decreased (P < 0.05) in the breast meat of the FAC group compared with the AC and PC groups, respectively. Proventriculus and kidney relative weights of the FAC group differed (P < 0.05) from the AC group but not from the PC group. Lower (P < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value of thigh meat was observed in the FAC group compared with the other groups. The FAC diet increased (P < 0.05) alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in meat. Alteration of these fatty acids led to increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid /saturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, and decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in breast or thigh meat (P < 0.05). It is concluded that FAC confers high tolerance to acid, bile and heat; and beneficially affects growth, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition. The FAC may be a functional feed additive in broilers.
TI  - Detection of mobile genetic elements in pediocin PA-1 like producing lactic acid  bacteria.
AB  - To evaluate the presence of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in intergeneric and interspecific pediocin producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) the flanking regions of the pediocin PA-1/AcH (pediocin PA-1) operon was characterized. In Enterococcus faecium Acr4 and Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2 a variation in the amplicon size in the downstream region of the operon was identified, suggesting a deletion in this region. Beyond that, in pediocin PA-1 encoding plasmids MGEs such as ISLpl1 and mobilization regions were detected by Southern hybridization analysis. Phylogenetic analyses of the E. faecium Acr4 ISLpl1 gene sequence suggested the gene transfer from lactobacilli in the environment. The tyrosine recombinase detected in pediocin plasmids of Pediococcus acidilactici H and K7 indicate a possible transfer of the entire operon among LAB. Since these elements are known to be associated with transfer of genes linked to the bacteriocin production, antibiotic resistance, and sugar utilization, we suggest similar mechanism for natural spread of pediocin PA-1 operon among different bacterial species.
TI  - Bioconversion of oleuropein to hydroxytyrosol by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this work is to study the conversion of oleuropein-a polyphenol present in olives and olive oil by-products-into hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenol with antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The hydrolysis reaction is performed by lactic acid bacteria. Six bacterial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum 6907, Lactobacillus paracasei 9192, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium lactis BO, Enterococcus faecium 32, Lactobacillus LAFTI 10) were tested under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The oleuropein degradation and hydroxytyrosol formation were monitored by HPLC. Results showed that oleuropein could be successfully converted into hydroxytyrosol. The most effective strain was Lactobacillus plantarum 6907, with a reaction yield of hydroxytyrosol of about 30 %. Different reaction mechanisms were observed for different microorganisms; a different yield was observed for Lactobacillus paracasei 9192 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and an intermediate metabolite (oleuropein aglycone) was detected for Lactobacillus paracasei 9192 and Lactobacillus plantarum 6907 only. This study could have significant applications, as this reaction can be used to increase the value of olive oil by-products and/or to improve the taste of unripe olives.
TI  - [Methodical approaches to isolation of teichoic acids from native cells of lactic acid bacteria probiotic strains].
AB  - Teichoic acids of lactic acid bacteria probiotic strains have been obtained by extraction from native cells, followed by purification of extracts using ion exchange chromatography. Selected fractions contained high concentrations of phosphorus and did not contain nucleic acids. The content of teichoic acid depended on the species and strain specificity. Heterogeneity of the studied biomolecules was revealed.
TI  - Presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of Indian origin.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus lactis, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermB gene. The efflux gene msrA was identified in E. faecium, E. durans, E. lactis, E. casseliflavus, P. pentosaceus and L. fermentum. Further analysis of the msrA gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrC. Resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetM, tetW, tetO, tetK and tetL, alone or in combination, were identified in Lactobacillus species. The tetracycline efflux genes tetK and tetL occurred in P. pentosaceus and Enterococcus species. Since it appeared that LAB had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Growth and survival of lactic acid bacteria in lucerne silage.
AB  - A rifampicin-resistant variant of two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, one strain of Pediococcus acidilactici, and one strain of Enterococcus faecium were used for the experimental production of lucerne silage. Laboratory silage without inoculants served as a control. Counts of total anaerobes, total lactic acid bacteria (LAB), lactobacilli, pediococci, and enterococci were determined on days 14, 21, 30, 49, and 60 of lucerne fermentation. LAB dominated in silage microflora, reaching a percentage between 59 and 95 % of total anaerobes. Lactobacilli were found as a predominant group of LAB during the whole study. Lactobacilli reached numbers 8.74 log CFU/g in treated silage and 8.89 log CFU/g in the control at the first observation. Their counts decreased to 4.23 and 4.92 log CFU/g in treated silage and the control, respectively, on day 63 of fermentation. Similar decreases were observed in all bacterial groups. The treated silage samples possessed lower pH (4.2 vs. 4.5 in control samples) and contained more lactic acid compared to control silage. The identity of re-isolated rifampicin-resistant bacteria with those inoculated to the lucerne was evaluated by fingerprinting techniques. The fingerprint profiles of re-isolated bacteria corresponded to the profiles of strains used for the treatment. It could be concluded that supplemented LAB dominated in laboratory silage and overgrew naturally occurring LAB.
TI  - Metabolites of Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 prevent oxidative stress-induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in IPEC-J2 cell line.
AB  - Probiotics have already proven beneficial effects in the treatment of several intestinal infections, but the underlying mechanisms how the probiotics can affect responses of porcine IPEC-J2 enterocytes to oxidative stress remained to be elucidated. The immunomodulatory effect of five bacterial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum 2142, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 and Enterococcus faecium CECT 4515) on 1 mM peroxide-triggered upregulation of interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) level was screened by q RT-PCR. Our data revealed that spent culture supernatant (SCS) of L. plantarum 2142 had significant lowering effect on IL-8 and TNF-alpha level with concomitant promoting activity on protective Hsp70 gene expression. According to our results, lactic acid (racemic, D: - and L: -lactic acid) and acetic acid produced by lactobacilli had no protective effect in quenching upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, L. plantarum 2142-specific supernatant peptides were detected by gel electrophoresis and capillary zone electrophoresis.
TI  - Effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to Caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Yeast cell wall (YCW) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of LAB. This extract was metabolised by the bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium to Caco-2 cells. Yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance LAB intestinal populations and control pathogens.
TI  - Newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  - Five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rRNA sequencing. Essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low pH, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. Efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. Antimicrobial activities against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. Further studies revealed Weissella and Enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. Folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in the human diet. The folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using Lactobacillus casei NCIM 2364 as indicator strain. The three strains of L. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.
TI  - Production of two bacteriocins in various growth conditions produced by gram-positive bacteria isolated from chicken cecum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum CLP29 and Enterococcus faecium CLE34 isolated from the cecal contents of young broiler chicks were identified based on physiological and biochemical characteristics, and identification was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Both bacteria showed a broad range of inhibitory action against bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli and produced two peptides, plantaricin CLP29 and enterocin CLE34. Treatment with proteinase K, trypase, or benase resulted in the loss of activity of the two peptides, confirming their proteinaceous nature. The highest activity levels for both bacteria were recorded in de Man - Rogosa - Sharpe agar at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, at 37 degrees C. Carbon and nitrogen sources affected the antibacterial activities of the two bacteriocins in different combinations, which suggested that the antibacterial abilities of different bacteriocins produced in nutrient sources were various.
TI  - The effect of a silage inoculant on silage quality, aerobic stability, and meat production on farm scale.
AB  - The effect of inoculation on nutrient content, fermentation, aerobic stability, and beef cattle performance for whole-plant corn silage treated with a commercial product (blend of homo- and heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, BSM, blend of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus brevis, DSM numbers 3530, 19457, and 23231, resp.), was compared to a control treatment with no silage additives (CT). The material had a DM of 323 g/kg, crude protein, and water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations of 87.9 and 110.5 g/kg DM, respectively. BSM increased the fermentation rate with a significantly deeper pH (P < 0.01), a significant increase in the total organic acids concentration (P < 0.05), more lactic acid (P < 0.01), and numerically more acetic acid compared to CT. BSM significantly decreased the concentrations of butyric acid (P < 0.01), ethanol, and ammonia-N compared to the CT. BSM-treated silage decreased DM by 3.0 % (P < 0.01) and had a higher digestible energy and a higher metabolizable energy concentration by 2.3 (P < 0.01) and 1.00 % (P < 0.05), respectively, compared to untreated silage. Aerobic stability improved by more than 2 days in BSM silage. The DM intake of silage treated with BSM increased by 6.14 %, and improved weight gain and the feed conversion by 8.0 (P < 0.01) and 3.4%.
TI  - [Microbial diversity of a community for ensiling rice straw at low temperature and fermentation dynamics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To accelerate the conversion of rice straw into feeds in the low-temperature region, a microbial community was constructed by continuous enrichment cultivation. Microbial diversity and dynamics during the fermentation at 10 degrees C was analyzed. METHODS: The community was selected at 5 degrees C under static condition. To analyze the inoculating effects, the community and commercial inoculant ( CI: composed of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, L. salivarilus, Pediococcus acidilactici) were respectively inoculated into the rice straw for 30 d fermentation at 10 degrees C. Fermented products were detected by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Composition microorganisms of the community were analyzed using cloning library. Microbial dynamics during the fermentation was detected by denatured gradient gel eletrophoresis (DGGE). Quantitative PCR was used for tracking the composition microorganisms of the community during the fermentation. RESULTS: The results from 16S rDNA cloning library showed that the community was mainly composed of Lactobacillus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. At 6d fermentation, the pH and the lactic acid bacterial colony forming units (LAB CFUs) in the fermented rice straw with the community amounted to 4.3 and 2.9 x 10(9) CFU/g fresh matter (FM), respectively. The pH and LAB CFUs with the CI were respectively 5.3 and 2.9 x 10(9) CFU/g FM. At 30 d fermentation, the lactic acid concentrations with the community and the CI were respectively 8.1 g/kg FM and 2.0 g/kg FM. From DGGE patterns, both L. sakei and Leuconostoc inhae of the community were detected at 6d fermentation and existed during the fermentation. For the treatment with the CI, the uncultured bacterium was detected at 6d fermentation besides the composition microorganisms of the CI. At 16d and 30d fermentation, only L. plantarum and E. faecium were detected. Quantitative PCR showed DNA mass of L. sakei amounted to 41.0% at 6d fermentation in the treatment with the community. At 16d, DNA mass of L. sakei was 65%. The highest value (5.5%) of DNA mass of Le inhae appeared at 6d of fermentation. CONCLUSION: The community could effectively colonize into the rice straw fermentation system and accelerate the fermentation process at low temperature. The dominating microorganism of the community was L. sakei at 10 degrees C.
TI  - Duodenal and faecal microbiota of celiac children: molecular, phenotype and metabolome characterization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiology of celiac disease (CD) is increasing. CD mainly presents in early childhood with small intestinal villous atrophy and signs of malabsorption. Compared to healthy individuals, CD patients seemed to be characterized by higher numbers of Gram-negative bacteria and lower numbers Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: This study aimed at investigating the microbiota and metabolome of 19 celiac disease children under gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease, T-CD) and 15 non-celiac children (HC). PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses by universal and group-specific primers were carried out in duodenal biopsies and faecal samples. Based on the number of PCR-DGGE bands, the diversity of Eubacteria was the higher in duodenal biopsies of T-CD than HC children. Bifidobacteria were only found in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, PCR-DGGE profiles of faecal samples for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria differed between T-CD and HC. As shown by culture-dependent methods, the levels of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Bifidobacteria were confirmed to be significantly higher (P = 0.028; P = 0.019; and P = 0.023, respectively) in fecal samples of HC than in T-CD children. On the contrary, cell counts (CFU/ml) of presumptive Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Shighella and Klebsiella were significantly higher (P = 0.014) in T-CD compared to HC children. Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus plantarum were the species most diffusely identified. This latter species was also found in all duodenal biopsies of T-CD and HC children. Other bacterial species were identified only in T-CD or HC faecal samples. As shown by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis, the percentage of strains identified as lactobacilli significantly (P = 0.011) differed between T-CD (ca. 26.5%) and HC (ca. 34.6%) groups. The metabolome of T-CD and HC children was studied using faecal and urine samples which were analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction and 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. As shown by Canonical Discriminant Analysis of Principal Coordinates, the levels of volatile organic compounds and free amino acids in faecal and/or urine samples were markedly affected by CD. CONCLUSION: As shown by the parallel microbiology and metabolome approach, the gluten-free diet lasting at least two years did not completely restore the microbiota and, consequently, the metabolome of CD children. Some molecules (e.g., ethyl-acetate and octyl-acetate, some short chain fatty acids and free amino acids, and glutamine) seems to be metabolic signatures of CD.
TI  - Microbial dynamics during aerobic exposure of corn silage stored under oxygen barrier or polyethylene films.
AB  - The aims of this study were to compare the effects of sealing forage corn with a  new oxygen barrier film with those obtained by using a conventional polyethylene film. This comparison was made during both ensilage and subsequent exposure of silage to air and included chemical, microbiological, and molecular (DNA and RNA) assessments. The forage was inoculated with a mixture of Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Enterococcus faecium and ensiled in polyethylene (PE) and oxygen barrier (OB) plastic bags. The oxygen permeability of the PE and OB films was 1,480 and 70 cm(3) m(-)(2) per 24 h at 23 degrees C, respectively. The silages were sampled after 110 days of ensilage and after 2, 5, 7, 9, and 14 days of air exposure and analyzed for fermentation characteristics, conventional microbial enumeration, and bacterial and fungal community fingerprinting via PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. The yeast counts in the PE and OB silages were 3.12 and 1.17 log(1)(0) CFU g(-)(1), respectively, with corresponding aerobic stabilities of 65 and 152 h. Acetobacter pasteurianus was present at both the DNA and RNA levels in the PE silage samples after 2 days of air exposure, whereas it was found only after 7 days in the OB silages. RT-PCR-DGGE revealed the activity of Aspergillus fumigatus in the PE samples from the day 7 of air exposure, whereas it appeared only after 14 days in the OB silages. It has been shown that the use of an oxygen barrier film can ensure a longer shelf life of silage after aerobic exposure.
TI  - Detection and characterization of pediocin PA-1/AcH like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from seven different sources. Eight isolates were found to produce pediocin PA-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedB gene PCR and dot-blot hybridization. The culture filtrate (CF) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and LAB. The identification and genetic diversity among the selected LAB was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like RFLP, RAPD, and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The isolates were identified as, 1 each of Pediococcus acidilactici Cb1, Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2, and Streptococcus equinus AC1, 2 were of P. pentosaceus Cb4 and R38, and other 3 were Enterococcus faecium Acr4, BL1, V3. Partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kDa and shared the properties of class IIa pediocin-family. The bacteriocin production at different temperatures, pH, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.
TI  - Monitoring the bacterial community of maize silage stored in a bunker silo inoculated with Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  - AIMS: To monitor variations in the bacterial community and fermentation products  of maize silage within and between bunker silos. METHODS AND RESULTS: Silage samples were collected in 2008 and 2009 from three dairy farms, wherein the farmers arranged for a contractor to produce maize silage using bunker silos. Silage was prepared using a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculant consisting of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus buchneri. Eight samples were collected from each bunker silo; 4 'outer' and 4 'inner' samples were collected from near the top and the bottom of the silo. The dry matter, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents differed between bunker silos in both sampling years. Higher acetic acid, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents were found in the bottom than the top layers in the 2008 samples, and higher lactic acid content was found in the top than the bottom layers in the 2009 samples. The bacterial community varied more between bunker silos than within a bunker silo in the 2008 samples, whereas differences between the top and the bottom layers were seen across bunker silos in the 2009 samples. The inoculated LAB were uniformly distributed, while several nonconventional silage bacteria were also detected. Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus panis and Acetobacter pasteurianus were detected in both years. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the 2008 samples, and Lactobacillus reuteri, Acinetobacter sp. and Rahnella sp. were detected in the 2009 samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although differences were seen within and between bunker silos, the bacterial community may indicate a different relationship between bunker silos and sampling locations within a bunker silo from that indicated by the fermentation products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Analysis of bacterial community can help understand how diverse non-LAB and LAB species are involved in the ensiling process of bunker-made maize silage.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of halotolerant lactic acid bacteria from  two Mexican cheeses.
AB  - Isolated strains of halotolerant or halophilic lactic acid bacteria (HALAB) from  Cotija and doble crema cheeses were identified and partially characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods, and their technological abilities were studied in order to test their potential use as dairy starter components. Humidity, a(w), pH, and salt concentration of cheeses were determined. Genotypic diversity was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction. Molecular identification and phylogenetic reconstructions based on 16S rRNA gene sequences were performed. Additional technological abilities such as salt tolerance, acidifying, and proteolytic and lipolytic activities were also investigated. The differences among strains reflected the biodiversity of HALAB in both types of cheeses. Lactobacillus acidipiscis, Tetragenococcus halophilus, Weissella thailandensis, and Lactobacillus pentosus from Cotija cheese, and L. acidipiscis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus farciminis, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus from doble crema cheese were identified based on 16S rRNA. Quantitative and qualitative assessments showed strains of T. halophilus and L. plantarum to be proteolytic, along with E. faecium, L. farciminis, and L. pentosus to a lesser extent. Lipolytic activity could be demonstrated in strains of E. faecium, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, and T. halophilus. Strains belonging to the species L. pentosus, L. plantarum, and E. faecium were able to acidify the milk media. This study evidences the presence of HALAB that may play a role in the ripening of cheeses.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. Diversity of RAPD types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical transfer of intestinal LAB from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - [Inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 reproduction by probiotic bacteria in  vitro].
AB  - Light and immunofluorescence microscopies were used to study the cytopathic effect of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) grown on the Vero cell cultures in the absence or presence of supernatants of Enterococcus faecium L3, Lactobacillus plantarum 8A-P3, and Escherichia coil M17. The effect of the probiotic strains was evaluated estimating the proportion of changed cells and the infective dose of the virus. The supernatants of the cultures of Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus sp., unlike those of E. coil, have antiviral activity. Inhibited viral replication was more evident when the supernatants were added until the cultured HSV-1 cells were infective. An enterococcal supernatant and its obtained peptide extract showed the maximum antiviral activity. This strain may be associated with the production of bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like substances.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-sun (fermented  bamboo shoots), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated, characterized and identified from jiang-sun (fermented bamboo shoots; a traditional fermented food in Taiwan). Samples were collected at seven time intervals from a fixed fermenting bucket during the fermentation process of jiang-sun and its initial ingredients, dochi (fermented soybeans) and bamboo shoots. RESULTS: A total of 57 LAB cultures were isolated; 42 cultures were isolated from jiang-sun samples and 15 cultures were isolated from dochi and bamboo shoots. These isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into three groups (A-C) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Alteration of microbial populations during the fermentation process was observed. While various LAB were found in the dochi and bamboo shoots, it was mostly replaced by Lactobacillus plantarum after 1 day of fermentation. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined, and one Enterococcus faecium strain showed inhibitory activity against all the indicator strains. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that L. plantarum is the main LAB present during the fermentation of jiang-sun. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of LAB that exist in the jiang-sun fermentation process.
TI  - Tyrosine- and histidine-decarboxylase positive lactic acid bacteria and enterococci in dry fermented sausages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and enterococci were isolated immediately after stuffing (day 0), at the end of ripening (28th day) and at the end of storage (112th day) from dry fermented sausages produced by two different producers (K; R) in two diameters (4.5 and 7 cm) using either of two spice mixtures (P; H) and either of two starter cultures (Pediococcus pentosaceus, C; Lactobacillus curvatus+Staphylococcus carnosus, F), resulting in a total of 16 different combinations. Tyrosine-decarboxylase DNA sequence (tyrdc) was identified on average in 88% and 44% of enterococci and LAB isolates, respectively at the end of ripening, the corresponding figures regarding histidine-decarboxylase gene sequence (hisdc) was 71% and 16%, respectively. Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis and L. casei/paracasei, and Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as tyramine/histamine producers in the sausages.
TI  - Bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in Manipur state of India.
AB  - Soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of Schizostachyum capitatum Munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in Manipur state of India. In this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), 16S rDNA sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This acidic starter (pH 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) together. The population distribution of dominant species were Bacillus subtilis 29.3%, Bacillus cereus 35.7%, Bacillus pumilus 2.6%, Lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, Lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, Carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, Enterococcus faecium 1.2% and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. Alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of B. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region and ITS-RFLP profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in B. subtilis, five subgroups in B. cereus and three subgroups in L. brevis isolates. The most abundant B. subtilis subgroup IB.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during RAPD analysis. The molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of Bacillus and LAB distributed in most of the starter samples. These dominant strains of B. subtilis, L. brevis and L. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the fecal samples of healthy humans and patients with dyspepsia, and determination of their ph, bile, and antibiotic tolerance properties.
AB  - The research of novel probiotic strains is important in order to satisfy the increasing request of the market and to obtain functional products in which the probiotic cultures are more active and have better probiotic characteristics than those already on the market. In this study, the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus and Enterococcus strains isolated from human feces was investigated. One hundred seven strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the fecal samples of 19 adult volunteers with stomach problems and the fecal samples of 12 healthy adult volunteers. The strains were identified by 16S rRNA analysis and examined for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 3.5) and bile salts (0.3% bile salt). The antibiotic susceptibility of the strains was also determined. The counts of lactic acid bacteria in the fecal samples ranged from 1.7 x 10(7) to 3.1 x 10(10) CFU/g. The species present in those samples were found to be Lactobacillusplantarum, L. fermentum, Enterococcus faecium and E. durans. Results indicated that L. plantarum (AA1-2, AA17-73, AC18-88, AK4-11, and AK7-28), L. fermentum (AB5-18, BB16-75, and AK4-180), E. faecium (AB20-98 and BK11-50) and E. durans (AK4-14 and BK9-40) showed good pH and bile tolerance. These strains are potentially good candidates for use as health-promoting bacteria.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Selection and use of phytate-degrading LAB to improve cereal-based products by mineral solubilization during dough fermentation.
AB  - New producers of phytate-degrading enzymes, especially lactic acid bacteria (LAB), were used to improve mineral solubilization during dough fermentation. In all, among strains from different sources by microorganisms (150 lactic acid bacteria, 36 yeasts), 38 (24%) exhibited a clear zone around the colonies by hydrolyzing hexacalcium phytate contained in solid medium. When phytase-positive strains from plate assay were tested for phytase activity in liquid medium, 6 of the strains (37%) exhibited phytate-degrading activity in at least one of the 3 different media used. Of the LAB, the highest phytase values were found for Enterococcus faecium A86 (0.74 U/mL) and Lactobacillus plantarum H5 (0.71 U/mL). Two different starter cultures obtained by combinations of phytase-positive (phy+: L. plantarum H5 and L3, Leuconostoc gelidum A16, and E. faecium A86) or phytase-negative (phy-: L. gelidum LM249, L. plantarum H19, and L. plantarum L8) selected LAB strains, were used to measure mineral concentrations of iron, zinc, and manganese during dough fermentation. Although the 2 kinds of starter showed similar acidic values, the presence of phytate-degrading LAB strains increased mineral solubilization in comparison to the starter phy-.
TI  - Microbiological studies of ethnic meat products of the Eastern Himalayas.
AB  - Native microorganisms from some ethnic meat products of the Eastern Himalayas such as lang kargyong, yak kargyong, faak kargyong, lang satchu, yak satchu and suka ko masu were isolated and characterized. The bacterial isolates included Lactobacillus sake, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus divergens, Lactobacillus carnis, Lactobacillus sanfrancisco, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceous, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus lentus and Bacillus licheniformis, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus. Yeast isolates included Debaryomyces hansenii, Debaryomyces polymorphus, Debaryomyces pseudopolymorphus, Pichia burtonii, Pichia anomala, Candida famata and the mould Rhizopus was also identified. Many of the LAB isolates demonstrated some antimicrobial activity, enzymatic activity and a few showed a high degree of hydrophobicity. None of the strains produced biogenic amines.
TI  - Influence of microfiltration and adjunct culture on quality of Domiati cheese.
AB  - The effects of microfiltration and pasteurization processes on proteolysis, lipolysis, and flavor development in Domiati cheese during 2 mo of pickling were studied. Cultures of starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from Egyptian dairy products were evaluated in experimental Domiati cheese for flavor development capabilities. In the first trial, raw skim milk was microfiltered and then the protein:fat ratio was standardized using pasteurized cream. Pasteurized milk with same protein:fat ratio was also used in the second trial. The chemical composition of cheeses seemed to be affected by milk treatment-microfiltration or pasteurization-rather than by the culture types. The moisture content was higher and the pH was lower in pasteurized milk cheeses than in microfiltered milk cheeses at d 1 of manufacture. Chemical composition of experimental cheeses was within the legal limits for Domiati cheese in Egypt. Proteolysis and lipolysis during cheese pickling were lower in microfiltered milk cheeses compared with pasteurized milk cheeses. Highly significant variations in free amino acids, free fatty acids, and sensory evaluation were found among the cultures used in Domiati cheesemaking. The cheese made using adjunct culture containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Enterococcus faecium received high scores in flavor acceptability. Cheeses made from microfiltered milk received a higher score in body and texture compared with cheeses made from pasteurized milk.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from Beloura and Chourico, traditional pork products from Portugal.
AB  - Bacteriocins bacST202Ch and bacST216Ch, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from Beloura and Chourico, respectively, inhibited the growth of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative meat spoilage bacteria. According to trycine-SDS-PAGE, bacST202Ch and bacST216Ch are approximately 3.5 and 10.0 kDa in size, respectively. Maximal activity of bacST202Ch (25,600 AU/ml) was recorded after 27 h of and bacST216Ch (102,400 AU/ml) after 22 h of growth. The mode of activity, as determined against Enterococcus faecium HKLHS, is bactericidal. Both peptides adsorb to the surface of the producer cells, but at very low concentrations. Both peptides remained active after 120 min at 100 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0. Treatment for 120 min at 121 degrees C did not affect bacST216Ch activity. Activity of bacST202Ch and bacST216Ch was not affected by 1% Triton X-100, Tween 80, Tween 20, SDS, NaCl, urea and EDTA. Bacteriocin ST216Ch was deactivated in the presence of 1% Triton X-114. The nucleotide sequence of a 1044 bp DNA fragment amplified from L. plantarum ST202Ch is identical to the structural gene encoding pediocin PA-1, suggesting that the two bacteriocins are identical. Based on the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, strains ST202Ch and ST216Ch may be used as starter cultures in the fermentation of meat products.
TI  - Effect of inoculated corn silage enriched with sunflower oil on rumen fermentation and lipid metabolism in an artificial rumen (RUSITEC).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some rumen isolates are able to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) from linoleic acid (LA) in vitro. Effects of providing diets containing corn silage (CS) and lucerne hay to an artificial rumen (RUSITEC) in which the corn was not inoculated (CS), or inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum CCM 4000 (CS + LP), Lactobacillus fermentum LF2 (CS + LF) or Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231 (CS + EF) and supplied with sunflower oil (SO; 30 g kg(-1); w/w) on rumen metabolism were examined. RESULTS: The SO affected the outputs of all fatty acids. TVA output of uninoculated CS with SO was lower as compared to inoculated CS. The interaction of the CS x SO in the daily output of TVA was detected (P < 0.001). The biohydrogenation of oleic, linoleic, alpha-linolenic and total fatty acids was influenced by SO (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Inoculated silage induces changes in the rumen metabolism which might be related to differences observed in the extent of rumen BH of PUFA in RUSITEC. SO supplementation might positively enhances the production of some rumen intermediates; however, relationships between inoculated silages and oil supplementation can be presumed in the daily production of trans-vaccenic acid.
TI  - Coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of Lactobacillus plantarum NC8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
AB  - Bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. The system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (PLNC8IF). We have used L. plantarum NC8 as a starter culture in Spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. We found that L. plantarum NC8 greatly enhanced its growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. Enterococcus faecium 6T1a-20 and Pediococcus pentosaceus FBB63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. In addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer NC8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental NC8 strain. Our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. We postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by L. plantarum NC8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most probably involving bacteriocin production. The design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of selected lactic acid bacteria for improved processing of Nem chua, a traditional fermented meat from Vietnam.
AB  - Nem chua is a traditional lactic acid fermented meat of Vietnam that is consumed  raw. During fermentation, the number of acid-producing bacteria increased significantly and by the final day (4th), it had reached approximately 8.4 log cfu/g, contributing to 94% of the total microbiota of the product. Out of 85 isolates obtained from the product, only 44 were confirmed Gram-positive and catalase-negative. These putative LAB isolates were purified and screened for antimicrobial and proteolytic activity. None of the isolates showed bacteriocin activity using the 'spot-on lawn' method, but showed antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus sakei and Enterococcus faecium using deferred assay. Four isolates showed good proteolytic activities at pH 7.0. These isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum using an API 50 CHL i.d. kit. Sequencing of the partial 16S rRNA gene amplified by primers 1101F (5'-AACGAGCGCAACCC-3') and 1407R (5'-GACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-3') showed 98% homology to Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and E-test methods after species-level identification. Resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by PCR. RESULTS: Distribution of resistance was found in different species. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. In addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. In contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. The genes msrC, vanX, and dfrA were detected in strains of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. Evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  - This study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models of non tumor origin. To this end, LAB strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release as well as the attachment ability of LAB on the cell lines was investigated. Various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral RV or TGEV disruption. Highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota against both RV and TGEV, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to Enterococcus faecium PCK38, Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179, Lactobacillus pentosus PCA227 and Lactobacillus plantarum PCA236 and PCS22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. A variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of NO(-) and H(2)O(2) (ROS) was obtained when LAB strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be LAB strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ROS release in more than one cell line. In contrast, the ability of the examined LAB strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was LAB strain but not cell line specific. Highest attachment ability was observed with L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans ACA-DC 4037 and E. faecium PCD71. Clear indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the L. casei Shirota against TGEV and with L. plantarum PCA236 against both RV and TGEV. In the rest of the cases, each interaction was LAB-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. However, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. Further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.
TI  - Characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from Irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 Leuconostoc, and 2 pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the E-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. The corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by PCR. Also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. Of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The erm(B) and msrA/B genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. Two tetracycline-resistant strains, Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(M) and tet(S) genes respectively. Intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and Leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (strA, strB, aadA, aadE) were identified. Four of 10 strains of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this phenotype were identified. Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides and Pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(M) gene of L. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to Lactococcus lactis BU-2-60 and to E. faecalis JH2-2. This study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in Irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other LAB strains.
TI  - Genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from African traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  - AIM: To identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) leaves, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) and African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, Ntoba Mbodi, Bikalga and Soumbala. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 121 LAB were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS-PCR), repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and DNA sequencing. The results revealed a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of LAB in African alkaline fermentations. The isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) Gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. ITS-PCR allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. Rep-PCR permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. DNA sequencing combined with use of API 50CHL and API 20Strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as Weissella confusa, Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus hirae from Ntoba Mbodi; Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Pediococcus acidilactici from Bikalga and Soumbala. CONCLUSION: LAB found in African alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study confirms that LAB survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with Tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  - The objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected from different areas of Tunisia. A polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal DNA-based techniques, was used to identify Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates. PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR of 102 isolates and other reference LAB strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (M-ISR) for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and M-ISR) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and L-ISR) for Lactobacilli, and (4) three PCR amplicons (S-ISR, M-ISR, and L-ISR) obtained for Pediococcus spp. and Weissella genus. The clustering and comparison of ISR-RFLP profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference LAB strains, allowed their identification as Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Enterococcus hawaiiensis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Weissella confusa. Combined 16S-23S rDNA ISR and RFLP patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of LAB and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Changes in the microbial composition of raw milk induced by thermization treatments applied prior to traditional Greek hard cheese processing.
AB  - The microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees C for 30 s. Such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard Greek cheeses. Raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log CFU/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and pseudomonads. The LAB flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). Enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and Enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the most common LAB isolates, followed by Enterococcus durans, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc lactis. Thermization at 60 degrees C for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log CFU/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log CFU/ml), and Listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. Thermization at 67 degrees C for 30 s had a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. Two nisin-producing L. lactis subsp. lactis strains (M78 and M104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing LAB strains were isolated from thermized milk. Thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable LAB and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective LAB strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.
TI  - [Identification of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains].
AB  - The identification of 5 probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria has been conducted by the method of analysis of physiological properties, API-testing as well as by molecular-genetic methods. It has been confirmed that 4 strains belong to Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus species. S. thermophilus strain has been reidentified as E. durans. The importance of clear identification of microorganism species which is used in probiotics has been demonstrated.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - Influence of lyophilization, fluidized bed drying, addition of protectants, and storage on the viability of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present study focuses on the impact of two different drying technologies and the influence of protectants on process survival and storage stability of the two lactic acid bacterial strains Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus plantarum. METHODS AND RESULTS: After incubation with the protectants glucose, sucrose, trehalose, and maltodextrin the concentrated bacterial suspensions were subjected to fluidized bed drying and lyophilization and subsequently stored at 4, 22, and 35 degrees C for half a year. Lactobacillus plantarum turned out to be more sensitive to both drying methods than Ent. faecium. Without the addition of a protectant cells of both strains suffered higher losses during fluidized bed drying. Elevated storage temperatures correlate with a higher decline of viable bacterial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although survival rates varied between the strains, the nonreducing disaccharides revealed overall best protection for both investigated lactic acid bacteria during processing and storage. The addition of protective carbohydrates can prevent the decline in viability during fluidized bed drying. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The influence of protectants proved to be species specific and therefore needs to be determined on a case-to-case basis. Survival rates, duration, and energy consumption appear to be the crucial parameters to evaluate the economy of production processes for industrial starter cultures.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "Alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in Portugal.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from "Alheira", a fermented sausage produced in Portugal. LAB were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16S rRNA. Two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and Enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. Low numbers of Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus zeae, Lactobacillus paracasei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Weissella cibaria, Weissella viridescens and Enterococcus faecium were recorded. The genetic heterogeneity of L. plantarum and E. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of DNA banding patterns obtained by RAPD-PCR. Strains of L. plantarum and E. faecalis were different from different producers. This study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "Alheira".
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Bulgarian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. METHOD AND RESULTS: Seven LAB strains [Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (PC5), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (BB18), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (BCM5, BK15), Enterococcus faecium (MH3), Lactobacillus plantarum (BR12), Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (BCZ2)], isolated from authentic Bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. The bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees C for 15 min, stable at pH 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. Two of bacteriocins produced by Lact. bulgaricus BB18 (bulgaricin BB18) and E. faecium MH3 (enterocin MH3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin BB18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus bulgaricus BB18 and E. faecium MH3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. Furthermore, bulgaricin BB18 strongly inhibits Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Microfluidic technology applied to cell-wall protein analysis of olive related lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A fully automated electrophoretic method for separating cell-wall proteins was applied to 102 isolates from olive phylloplane and brine previously phenotypically identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (10), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (60), Leuconostoc spp. (12) and Enterococcus faecium (19). The high sensitivity of this technique allowed to discriminate isolates and to distinguish closely related strains within the same species. L. plantarum was characterized by proteins at 70.4 and 163.9 kDa, while 3 proteins (20.4, 52.9, 68. kDa) were typical for E. faecium. No characteristic proteins were found for Leuconostoc isolates except for that at 31.8 kDa mainly related to the ecological origin since only isolates from brine showed this protein. However, Leuc. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Leuconostoc spp. were differentiated by additional proteins. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of selected strains was in agreement with the phenotypic identification and allowed to identify all Leuconostoc spp. isolates as Leuc. mesenteroides. Cell-wall protein fingerprinting performed by microfluidic technology completed the phenotypic characterization of olive-related lactic acid bacteria allowing their strain typing.
TI  - Effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Weissella cibaria/confusa, Lactobacillus brevis, Pediococcus pentosaceous, Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by Biolog System, partial 16S rRNA gene sequence and subjected to typing by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) analysis. Ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (TJ) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees C for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees C for 40 days. Unstarted TJ and TJ fermented with an allochthonous strain of L. plantarum were used as the controls. All autochthonous strains grew well in TJ reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted TJ and TJ fermented with the allochthonous strain. Viscosity of TJs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with W. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. Overall, unstarted TJ and TJ fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (ASC), glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant activity (TTA) during storage. On the contrary, several TJs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with L. plantarum POM1 and POM 35, maintained elevated values of ASC, GSH and TAA. The variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. TJs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through Purge and Trap or Solid Phase Microextraction Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (PT or SPME-GC/MS) analysis. As shown by Principal Component Analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated TJs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.
TI  - Rep-PCR characterization and biochemical selection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the Delta area of Egypt.
AB  - Samples of raw milk and traditional dairy products were collected from different  rural areas in the Delta region. 170 isolates from these products were identified using repetitive genomic element-PCR (Rep-PCR) fingerprinting. The identified isolates were tested for efficiency of biomass production and separation, acidifying activity, autolytic and aminopeptidase properties, antagonistic activities and exopolysaccharide production. The obtained results revealed that the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the predominant species in Egyptian dairy products. Two percent of Lactococcus, 10% of Lactobacillus and 1% of Enterococcus isolates showed fast acidifying activity. Aminopeptidase and autolytic properties were generally higher for most Lactobacillus strains when compared to other strains. Among these species, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei was the highest in Aminopeptidase activity and autolytic properties. Antagonistic activity was detected in 40% of Lactococcus, 70% of Lactobacillus and 50% of Enterococcus isolates. Some isolates produced exopolysaccharides in milk and dairy products.
TI  - A survey of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from Serbian artisanal dairy product kajmak.
AB  - Kajmak is an artisanal Serbian dairy product made by fermentation of milk fat. Overall, 374 bacterial isolates were collected from six kajmak samples of different ages produced in the households located in distinct regions of Serbia. In order to identify lactic acid bacteria present in chosen samples of kajmak, total 349 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were analyzed. The recognition of isolates was performed by phenotypic characterization followed by molecular identification using (GTG)(5)-PCR and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Enterococcus faecium were the most frequently isolated species from kajmak samples. In contrast, leuconostocs and enterococci were found in BGMK3 and BGMK1 kajmak respectively, only after using enrichment technique for isolation suggesting they are present in low numbers in these kajmaks. Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis and Lactococcus garvieae were also found in those samples but in lower proportion. Results showed that Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. paracasei and Lb. kefiri were the most frequently isolated Lactobacillus species in analyzed kajmaks.
TI  - Biodiversity of the microbial community in a Spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - The microbial diversity within Alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the Alpujarra mountains (Granada, south-east Spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community DNA. A collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analyses. Isolates on Man-Rogosa and Sharpe-agar (MRS), M17-glucose agar and Kenner Fecal (KF)-agar medium were identified by specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. The predominant genus was Lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being Lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis. Other lactic-acid bacteria identified were Pediococcus urinaequi, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuc. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci Enterococcus faecium and E. devriesei. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. The Gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to Hafnia alvei species. The microbes occurring in Alberquilla cheese were also studied by PCR temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the 16S rRNA V3 region and partial 16S rRNA sequencing of the TTGE bands. The results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to Lc. lactis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. acidophilus and Enterococcus sp. The non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as Escherichia coli. All the Enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaAfm. On the basis of their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of Ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin B105 and mesenterocin Y105, as revealed by PCR techniques.
TI  - Identification and characterization of Lactic Acid Bacteria isolated from Tibetan Qula cheese.
AB  - Fourteen strains of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) isolated from Qula, a Tibetan traditional yak cheese, were divided into four groups (A-D) according to morphological and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, group A and group B strains were placed in the cluster making up the genus Leuconostoc, which together with Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, formed a distinct cluster. The group C strain was clearly identified as Enterococcus faecium by forming a very well defined cluster with this species. The group D strains were placed in the lactobacilli cluster with Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus being the closely related species. On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, strains in the groups A, B, C and D were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus plantarum, respectively. Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum was the dominate member of the population.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Zlatar cheese.
AB  - AIMS: Isolation, characterization and identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from artisanal Zlatar cheese during the ripening process and selection of strains with good technological characteristics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Characterization of LAB was performed based on morphological, physiological and biochemical assays, as well as, by determining proteolytic activity and plasmid profile. rep-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing were used for the identification of LAB. PCR analysis was performed with specific primers for detection of the gene encoding nisin production. Strains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present in the Zlatar cheese during ripening. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal changes in the species were observed during the Zlatar cheese ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli are predominant microflora in Zlatar cheese. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study we determined that Zlatar cheese up to 30 days old could be used as a source of strains for the preparation of potential starter cultures in the process of industrial cheese production. As the Serbian food market is adjusting to European Union regulations, the standardization of Zlatar cheese production by using starter culture(s) based on autochtonous well-characterized LAB will enable the industrial production of this popular cheese in the future.
TI  - Characterization of dominant lactic acid bacteria isolated from Sao Jorge cheese, using biochemical and ribotyping methods.
AB  - AIMS: To identify, using phenotypic and genotypic methods, the dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in Sao Jorge cheese - one of the 11 Portuguese cheeses currently bearing an Appellation d'Origine Protegee status. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 225 isolates from milk, curd and cheeses throughout ripening were identified to the genus level, 108 to the species level and ten to the strain level. Phenotypic methods indicated that lactobacilli, followed by enterococci, were the dominant bacteria. The most frequently isolated species were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Ribotyping differentiated three L. paracasei, two E. faecalis and one Lactobacillus plantarum types. Enterococcus spp. exhibited the highest esterase and beta-galactosidase activities among all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The dominant LAB in Sao Jorge cheese are L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, E. faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococcus likely plays a leading role upon acidification and aroma development in said cheese. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results support that a combination of conventional biochemical methods with genotypic methods allows for a thorough characterization and identification of isolates. Despite the limited number of isolates subject to molecular subtyping, a few specific Enterococcus and Lactobacillus strains were found that are promising ones for development of a starter culture. Hence, L. paracasei and E. faecalis are good candidates for a tentative starter culture, designed for manufacturing of Sao Jorge cheese at large - which takes advantage of actual isolates, in attempts to eventually standardize the quality of said cheese variety.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. FN3K homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. In 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the FN3K homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (LMW-PTP) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the FN3K homologue. Five bacterial FN3K homologues (from Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Staphylococcus aureus and Thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. Four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. They also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian FN3K-related protein. The E. coli FN3K homologue (YniA) was inactive on all tested substrates. The LMW-PTP of T. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an FN3K homologue, and an LMW-PTP of S. aureus (PtpA) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. These LMW-PTPs were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. It is concluded that most bacterial FN3K homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. They may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.
TI  - Dominant lactic acid bacteria and their technological properties isolated from the Himalayan ethnic fermented milk products.
AB  - Ethnic people of the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, Bhutan and China consume  a variety of indigenous fermented milk products made from cows milk as well as yaks milk. These lesser-known ethnic fermented foods are dahi, mohi, chhurpi, somar, philu and shyow. The population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) ranged from 10(7) to 10(8) cfu/g in these Himalayan milk products. A total of 128 isolates of LAB were isolated from 58 samples of ethnic fermented milk products collected from different places of India, Nepal and Bhutan. Based on phenotypic characterization including API sugar test, the dominant lactic acid bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus bifermentans, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. pseudoplantarum, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and Enterococcus faecium. LAB produced a wide spectrum of enzymes and showed high galactosidase, leucine-arylamidase and phosphatase activities. They showed antagonistic properties against selected Gram-negative bacteria. None of the strains produced bacteriocin and biogenic amines under the test conditions used. Most strains of LAB coagulated skim milk with a moderate drop in pH. Some strains of LAB showed a high degree of hydrophobicity, suggesting these strains may have useful adhesive potential. This paper is the first report on functional lactic acid bacterial composition in some lesser-known ethnic fermented milk products of the Himalayas.
TI  - Characterization of Italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  - Four Italian cheeses (Casciotta di Urbino, Barricato San Martino, Vento d'Estate, and Ubriaco di Raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. Mean values for gross composition were rather similar. Because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). Except for Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus durans/Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella cibaria/Weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their origin. As shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free AA, the secondary proteolysis of Barricato San Martino and Vento d'Estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. Purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. Vento d'Estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and Casciotta di Urbino was characterized by a very low level of volatile components. Esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. Several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for Vento d'Estate cheese. The lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in Casciotta d'Urbino, in which rennet paste was not used during manufacture. The highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in Vento d'Estate cheese.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - [Reversion of antibiotic-sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria in grafted cultures  of lymphoblastoid human cells].
AB  - The reversion of the antibiotic sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum have been studied. The phenomenon of the reversion has been fists studied in lactic acid bacteria of different taxonomic groups at their interactions with lymphoblastoid human cells. It is shown that resistance of lactobacteria to antibiotics can change depending on the terms of cultivation, genus and strain specificity. Most often the reversion of antibiotic sensitivity was observed with respect to fuzidin (26%) and cefepim (23%), most rarely--with respect to cephazolin, erithromicin, cefamandol, tobramicin and oxacillin.
TI  - [Study of probiotic properties of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum G3/3(13) strain].
AB  - Bacteriocinogenic culture Lactobacillus plantarum G3/3(13) was tested according to the basic requirements to probiotic strains. The reidentification of the strain was carried out using a set of methods including PCR. It was confirmed that the strain belongs to the species L. plantarum. The studied culture expressed antagonistic activity with respect to Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. The susceptibility test to 57 antibiotics of different groups showed that the strain was resistant to oxacillin, cefepyme, lomefloxacin, polymyxin, nalidixic acid and the antifungal antibiotics. High adhesive properties of the microorganism to the human epithelial cells (medium adhesion index was 4.6-5.6; microorganism adhesion index was 4.9-5.9) were shown. Obtained results allow to recommend L. plantarum G3/3(13) for the construction of probiotics.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of "androlla", a Spanish traditional pork sausage.
AB  - Counts of total aerobic mesophilic microflora, lactic acid bacteria, salt-tolerant microflora, Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts, and staphylococci, and some physico-chemical parameters (total solids, NaCl and nitrate contents and pH and aw values) were determined in 20 units of "androlla", a traditional dry-fermented sausage made in the NW of Spain. In general, high counts of all the investigated microbial groups were observed, with average values of 8.99 +/- 0.46 log cfu/g for the total aerobic mesophilic microflora, 9.11 +/- 0.16 log cfu/g for the lactic acid bacteria, 6.87 +/- 0.68 log cfu/g for the salt-tolerant microflora, 2.80+/-1.85 log cfu/g for the Enterobacteriaceae, 3.25 +/- 1.86 log cfu/g for the enterococci, 4.30 +/- 1.73 log cfu/g for the moulds and yeasts, and 3.62 +/- 0.60 log cfu/g for the staphylococci. From MRS agar, SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, VRBG agar, and KAA agar, 10 colonies were randomly taken from each androlla unit and from each culture medium. A total of 200 strains per culture medium were then identified using the classical methods. Among the isolates from MRS agar, Lactobacillus sakei predominated, followed by Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus plantarum. Of the 200 isolates obtained from SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, only 56 strains belonged to the Staphylococcaceae or Micrococcaceae families. Among the Staphylococcaceae, Staphylococcus xylosus was the main species, followed by Staph. epidermidis; Staph. equorum, Staph. capitis and Staph. saprophyticus were isolated in very low proportions. Among the Micrococcaceae, Micrococcus luteus predominated, followed by Micrococcus lylae, Kocuria varians and Kocuria kristinae. Of the 150 isolates obtained from VRBG agar, Hafnia alvei was the main species, followed by Serratia liquefaciens and Enterobacter amnigenus; six isolates were identified as Salmonella. Among the 190 isolates obtained from KAA agar, 122 were considered enterococci; 20 isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium, one as Enterococcus faecalis and 101 as Enterococcus inter faecalis-faecium.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - [Study of some properties of strain Lactobacillus plantarum G3/3(13) antagonistic factor].
AB  - The screening of strains which expressed antagonistic activity, that is not connected with lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide synthesis was conducted among 72 cultures of lactic acid bacteria. The strain L. plantarum G3/3(13) which inhibited growth of 11 test-cultures including Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium was selected. The antibacterial factor was of protein nature, did not retain the activity after boiling and was active at pH 2.0-8.0, whereas at pH 9.0 its activity fell significantly. The obtained results allow to assume that the formed agent can be bacteriocin-like substance and the strain L. plantarum G3/3(13) may be useful for food industry or probiotic construction.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of Caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  - Fermentation of capers (the fruits of Capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. A lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. A collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis. Isolates were identified by PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), Lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), Lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), Lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), Pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), Pediococcus acidilactici (1 isolate), and Enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. A culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (TTGE) also indicated that L. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. The distribution of L. brevis and L. fermentum in samples was also determined by TTGE, but identification of Pediococcus at the species level was not possible. TTGE also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of E. faecium, and the detection of Enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). Results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.
TI  - Phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the Eastern Himalayas.
AB  - Sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the Eastern Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. A total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. Population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. A total of 189 strains of LAB were isolated from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. LAB were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including API system as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weissella confusa. LAB strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. Some strains of LAB showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. None of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. This paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of Eastern Himalayas.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - Use of real time PCR to determine population profiles of individual species of lactic acid bacteria in alfalfa silage and stored corn stover.
AB  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. Species-specific PCR primers were designed based on recA gene sequences. Commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. Lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant LAB (12 to 32% of total sample DNA) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96 h. Modest populations (up to 10%) of Lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. Pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. Small populations (0.1 to 1%) of Lactobacillus buchneri and Lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while Lactobacillus pentosus and Enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. Corn stover generally displayed higher populations of L. plantarum and L. brevis and lower populations of other LAB species. The data illustrate the utility of RT-PCR for quantifying individual species of LAB in conserved forages prepared under a wide variety of conditions.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Antigenotoxicity of probiotics and prebiotics on faecal water-induced DNA damage  in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  - Six strains of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) were incubated (1 x 10(8)cfu/ml) with genotoxic faecal water from a human subject. HT29 human adenocarcinoma cells were then challenged with the resultant samples and DNA damage measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. The LAB strains investigated were Bifidobacterium sp. 420, Bifidobacterium Bb12, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Enterococcus faecium. DNA damage was significantly decreased by all bacteria used with the exception of Strep. thermophilus. Bif. Bb12 and Lact. plantarum showed the greatest protective effect against DNA damage. Incubation of faecal water with different concentrations of Bif. Bb12 and Lact. plantarum revealed that the decrease in genotoxicity was related to cell density. Non-viable (heat treated) probiotic cells had no effect on faecal water genotoxicity. In a second study, HT29 cells were cultured in the presence of supernatants of incubations of probiotics with various carbohydrates including known prebiotics; the HT29 cells were then exposed to faecal water. Overall, incubations involving Lact. plantarum with the fructooligosaccharide (FOS)-based prebiotics Inulin, Raftiline, Raftilose and Actilight were the most effective in increasing the cellular resistance to faecal water genotoxicity, whereas fermentations with Elixor (a galactooligosaccharide) and Fibersol (a maltodextrin) were less effective. Substantial reductions in faecal water-induced DNA damage were also seen with supernatants from incubation of prebiotics with Bif. Bb12. The supernatant of fermentations involving Ent. faecium and Bif. sp. 420 generally had less potent effects on genotoxicity although some reductions with Raftiline and Elixor fermentations were apparent.
TI  - [Analysis of monosaccharides of bacterial glycocalix of Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus group by gas-chromatography].
AB  - The glycocalix of some bacteria of the Bacillus--Lactobacillus--Streptococcus (Bacillus subtilis 3, B. subtilis 668, B. licheniformis 31, Lactobacillus plantarum 11/16, Enterococcus faecium K-50) group were isolated and composition of neutral monosaccharides was investigated. Such sugars as rhamnose, ribose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose were found in the investigated representatives of genus Bacillus--Lactobacillus--Streptococcus. Presence of significant quantity of glucose and galactose did not depend on cultivation conditions. This fact testifies to its conservatism and a possibility to use it as phylogenetic marker.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  - Nostrano di Primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park area in the Italian Dolomites. In summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, Passo Rolle and Vanoi, in the Paneveggio Natural Park. During the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. The microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by RAPD analysis and identified by 16S rRNA sequence. The milk of the Passo Rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic Streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the Vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei. The plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. The dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. Moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. The Vanoi cheese was dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus macedonicus in the first two days and mesophilic 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. In the first few days, the Rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. During ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. The taxonomical identification by 16S rRNA sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of S. macedonicus, Lactobacillus plantarum, 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum and E. faecium were detected in both cheeses.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei, dominant species in naturally fermented Sicilian green olives.
AB  - This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria in naturally fermented green olives, collected from different areas of Sicily. Both classical biochemical tests and PCR/Restriction Fragments Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of 16S rDNA were used to characterize the isolates. The identity of the isolates was obtained by the partial sequencing analysis of the 16S rDNA. The BioMerieux software assigned the 13 heterofermentative strains to the Lactobacillus brevis species; 24 homofermentative strains were classified as Lactobacillus casei and the remaining 11 homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum. The rapid ID 32 STREP test identified coccal-shaped strains as Enterococcus faecium species. The PCR/RFLP analysis showed a remarkable bacterial heterogeneity within the isolates. The 16S rDNA partial sequencing did not confirm biochemical identification, revealing a strong dominance of isolates belonging to the L. casei species. It is noteworthy that this species has never been reported as dominant species in fermented vegetables.A combination of molecular and biochemical analysis allowed the identification of species involved in natural food fermentations.
TI  - The effects of using lactic acid bacteria inoculants in maize silage on the formation of biogenic amines.
AB  - Silages from five ripened varieties of silage maize with dry matter contents ranging between 275 and 410 g/kg were prepared in five laboratory experiments. Whole-plant maize was fermented at 22 degrees C and silages were then stored at the same temperature for 4 months. Spontaneously fermented silages were prepared as control variants and compared with silages inoculated with commercial strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobzcillus buchneri and a mixed preparation Microsil containing L. plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The starter cultures were applied at doses 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6) CFU/g of chopped maize. Seven biogenic amines and polyamines were extracted from silages with perchloric acid and determined as N-benzamides by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. Common chemical criteria of silage quality were also determined. All three inoculants, mainly at the higher dose, decreased significantly contents of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine, three undesirable amines occurring at the highest levels. L. plantarum was the most effective. Contents of histamine and tryptamine were low in all experimental silages. Also relatively low were levels of polyamines spermidine and mainly of spermine.
TI  - Construction and use of a computerized DNA fingerprint database for lactic acid bacteria from silage.
AB  - Efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) requires excellent strain discrimination. Toward that end, we constructed a GelCompar II database of DNA fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained EcoRI fragments of total LAB DNA separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. We found that the total DNA patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 American Type Culture Collection strains of 33 species of LAB could be distinguished. Enterococcus faecium strains ATCC19434 and ATCC35667 had identical total DNA patterns and RiboPrints. Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains ATCC7469 and ATCC27773 also had identical total DNA patterns, but different RiboPrints. EcoRI RiboPrint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 Lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 Lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by EcoRI total DNA patterns. Despite gel-to-gel variation, new DNA patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using GelCompar II. The database contains large homogenous clusters of L. plantarum, E. faecium, L. buchneri, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. We routinely use the DNA fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. The GelCompar II database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized DNA fingerprint database for LAB yet reported.
TI  - Binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ECM) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECM molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. Porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. Strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota and L. johnsonii La1) as well as by L. casei L.c., Lactobacillus sp. 2I3 and by L. plantarum LP. The other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. Strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. Bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some animal strains (at least L. casei L.c. and Lactobacillus sp. 2I3) are comparable with the commercially used strains with respect to their ECM binding ability. As this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.
TI  - Microbial quality and direct PCR identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic Staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  - Detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific PCR. Without enrichment, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. Enriched samples allowed the detection of L. sakei and S. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of Enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. The percentages of L. curvatus, L. plantarum, Staphylococcus carnosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. L. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. L. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. S. epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and S. carnosus was detected in only 5.9% of chorizos. Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. From a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of Enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of the food-borne pathogens assayed.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin Salers cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin Salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in France, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. The aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of RDO Salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. This included DNA extraction, PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Bacterial and high-GC% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify V2 or V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. SSCP patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. Patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. Bacteria belonging to the high-GC% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. The present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from human vaginal secretions.
AB  - A total of 57 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the vaginal secretions of 259 patients. Of these strains, 37 were isolated from patients attending pre-natal clinics and the remaining strains from patients attending post-natal clinics. The strains were identified by using simple physiological and biochemical tests and their phenotypic relatedness determined by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. The genotypic relatedness of representative strains selected from each of the protein profile clusters was determined by numerical analysis of the DNA banding patterns obtained from RAPD-PCR. The majority of lactobacilli isolated belonged to the species Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecium. A few strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Weissella viridescens were also isolated. One strain, TV 1029, grouped into the same protein profile cluster as E. faecium, but revealed a DNA banding pattern closer related to Enterococcus faecalis. This is the first report of W. viridescens associated with the human vagina.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin KS, an antilisterial peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii NFRI 7393.
AB  - Mundticin KS, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus mundtii NFRI 7393 isolated from grass silage in Thailand, is active against closely related lactic acid bacteria and the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin KS was done. Mundticin KS was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sequential ion-exchange chromatography, and solid-phase extraction. The gene cluster (mun locus) for mundticin KS production was cloned, and DNA sequencing revealed that the mun locus consists of three genes, designated munA, munB, and munC. The munA gene encodes a 58-amino-acid mundticin KS precursor, munB encodes a protein of 674 amino acids involved in translocation and processing of the bacteriocin, and munC encodes a mundticin KS immunity protein of 98 amino acids. Amino acid and nucleotide sequencing revealed the complete, unambiguous primary structure of mundticin KS; mundticin KS comprises a 43-amino-acid peptide with an amino acid sequence similar to that of mundticin ATO6 produced by E. mundtii ATO6. Mundticin KS and mundticin ATO6 are distinguished by the inversion of the last two amino acids at their respective C termini. These two mundticins were expressed in Escherichia coli as recombinant peptides and found to be different in activity against certain Lactobacillus strains, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus. Mundticin KS was successfully expressed by transformation with the recombinant plasmid containing the mun locus in heterogeneous hosts such as E. faecium, L. curvatus, and Lactococcus lactis. Based on our results, the mun locus is located on a 50-kb plasmid, pML1, of E. mundtii NFRI 7393.
TI  - Ruminal supplementation of direct-fed microbials on diurnal pH variation and in situ digestion in dairy cattle.
AB  - To evaluate the effect of direct-fed microbial (DFM) concentration on diurnal rumen pH profiles and in situ digestibilities, nine ruminally cannulated cows in early lactation were fed treatments consisting of DFM (Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) at a level of a) 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml of rumen fluid (10(5)), b) 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of rumen fluid (10(6)), and c) 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml rumen fluid (10(7)). Treatments were directly administered via rumen cannula once daily. Cows were fitted with pH probes in their cannula and connected to dataloggers, which monitor pH hourly. The experimental period was 21 d: 7-d adjustment, 14-d for pH, and in situ measurements. Cows fed 10(5) were able to sustain a higher nadir pH than were cows fed 10(6) or 10(7). Cows fed 10(5) had a higher digestion rate of high moisture ear corn (HMEC) dry matter. Corn silage digestion was higher for cows fed 10(5) and 10(6) compared with those receiving 10(7). There were no carryover effects of treatment associated with rumen pH when switching from one treatment regimen to the next. Results from this study demonstrate that incorporation of a specific level of DFM aids in reducing diurnal ruminal acidity.
TI  - Effect of inoculants on whole-crop barley silage fermentation and dry matter disappearance in situ.
AB  - Whole-crop barley harvested at the mid-dough stage was ensiled in 3-L laboratory  silos either directly (at 30.7% DM) or after wilting (37.8% DM), and with or without application of Inoculant A, B, or D. Each inoculant contained multiple strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium. Two silos per treatment were opened on d 1, 3, 7, 15, and 47 for silage analysis. Wilted silages had higher (P < 0.05) pH than unwilted silages, and Inoculant B (unwilted crop) and Inoculants A, B, and D (wilted crop) decreased (P < 0.05) silage pH compared to the controls. Reducing sugars concentration was 36% lower (P < 0.05), on average, in the wilted than in the unwilted silages. Silages prepared with Inoculants B or D had lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of reducing sugars than the control. Wilting of the barley crop further increased the difference between inoculated and control silages (wilting x inoculation P < 0.05). Neither wilting nor silage inoculants affected concentrations of nonprotein N, ammonia N, or free amino acid N in silage. Wilting did not affect the concentration of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the silages. Across DM levels, inoculant-treated silages had larger (P < 0.01) populations of LAB than did the uninoculated controls (7.1 x 10(9) vs 2.3 x 10(9) cfu/g silage DM). Wilting resulted in lesser (P < 0.05) silage lactic acid concentration than the directly ensiled crop. At both DM levels, lactic acid concentration was higher (P < 0.001) in inoculated silages than in controls. The in situ soluble and potentially degradable fractions of silage DM were not affected by wilting or inoculant treatment. The rate of degradation of the potentially degradable silage DM was 35% lower (P < 0.05) in wilted than in unwilted silage. As a result, the calculated effective degradability of silage DM was lower (P < 0.001) in wilted than in unwilted silage. Inoculants did not influence the rate of degradation or effective degradability of silage DM in the rumen. Whole-crop barley ensiled at approximately 30% DM (without wilting) contained higher concentrations of soluble sugars and lactic acid and had higher ruminal degradability of DM than wilted silage (38% DM). Although inoculants did not improve DM degradability of barley silage, lower terminal pH and increased concentrations of lactic acid may improve aerobic stability upon feed-out.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - [The antibacterial resistance of the strains making up the components of probiotic preparations].
AB  - The spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of 21 strains of normal microflora, mainly forming constituents of widely used probiotics to 25 antibacterial preparations. Lactobacillus spp. were prevalent in the strains under test. The spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli varied, the gradation of resistance being more pronounced with respect to strains and not species. Both highly sensitive and highly resistant Lactobacillus strains were found: L. acidophilus (a component of biopreparation "Linex"), L. plantarum 8RA3, L. fermentum 90T4C (probiotic "Lactobacterin"), L. fermentum BL96. Bacteria used as the components of combined preparation "Linex" exhibited the highest resistance to a number of modern antibiotics. Strains of bifidobacteria were found to be highly sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - [The role of the carbohydrate composition of the glycocalyx in some species of lactobacilli in the manifestation of their adhesive properties].
AB  - Availability of certain monosaccharides in the composition of glycocalyx of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum--strains 337D and 11/16; Streptococcus thermophilus--strains S1 (nonmucous race) and S5 (mucous race), Enterococcus faecium (K-50) has been investigated with the help of plant lectins with certain carbohydrate specificity labelled by colloid gold. All the microorganisms under investigation were characterized by the presence of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in rather insignificant amounts. Glycocalyx of lactic acid bacteria was also characterized by availability of essential amount of L-fructose and low amount of sialic acid (except for S. thermophilus S5 (mucous race). Presence of alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, alpha-D, beta-D-galactose, alpha-D-glucose, alpha-D-mannose in the composition of the lactic acid bacteria glycocalyx composition evidences for the additional role of these monosaccharides in the process of the microorganism adhesion on the human and animal intestine mucosa. It has been confirmed that availability of certain monosaccharides in the composition of surface glycopolymers of lactic acid bacteria was connected with adhesive properties of cells and their existence conditions.
TI  - The influence of bacterial inoculants on the microbial ecology of aerobic spoilage of barley silage.
AB  - The aerobic decomposition of barley silage treated with two inoculants (LacA and  LacB) containing mixtures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium was investigated over a 28-day period. Initially, yeast and bacterial populations were larger in silage inoculated with LacA than in silage treated with LacB or water alone (control). Differences in the succession of yeasts in silage treated with LacA were observed relative to the other two treatments. From silage treatment with LacA, Issatchenkia orientalis was the most prevalent yeast taxon over all of the sample times, and the filamentous fungus Microascus brevicaulis was also frequently isolated at later sample dates (> or = 14 days). In contrast, Saccharomyces exiguus was the most prominent yeast recovered from silage treated with LacB and water alone on days 2 and 4, although it was supplanted by I. orientalis at later sample times. Successional trends of bacteria were similar for all three treatments. Lactobacillus spp. were initially the most prevalent bacteria isolated, followed by Bacillus spp. (primarily Bacillus pumilus). However, the onset of Bacillus spp. prominence was faster in LacA silage, and Klebsiella planticola was frequently recovered at later sample times (> or = 14 days). More filamentous fungi were recovered from LacA silage on media containing carboxylmethylcellulose, pectin, or xylan. The most commonly isolated taxa were Absidia sp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Byssochlamys nivea, Monascus ruber, Penicillium brevicompactum, Pseudoallescheria boydii, and M. brevicaulis. The results of this study indicated that the two bacterial inoculants incorporated into barley at the time of ensilage affected the microbial ecology of silage decomposition following exposure to air. However, neither of the microbial inoculants effectively delayed aerobic spoilage of barley silage, and the rate of decomposition of silage treated with one of the inoculants (LacA) was actually enhanced.
TI  - Effect of leavening microflora on pizza dough properties.
AB  - Fourteen different starter cultures containing one strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with and without individual or combinations of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. sanfrancisco, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides) were employed to investigate the role of leavening microflora on the properties of pizza doughs. Microbiological, chemical and physical characteristics of doughs prepared with the same flour and under the same processing conditions were determined. Leavening times and acidification properties depended on the microbial association used. The proportions of lactic and acetic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria were consistent with the metabolic properties of the strains employed. The bacteria/yeast ratios arising from microbial counts at the end of the leavening process were always lower in comparison to sour- or bread-doughs. The size of the yeast population did not change much, while bacteria showed from one to four duplications. Rheologically, the fermented doughs could only be significantly distinguished from the control dough with regard to the elastic modulus. Principal Component Analysis was applied to the acidimetric data. The scattergram of the two principal components effectively discriminated 13 of the 14 pizza dough types.
TI  - Comparative assessment of bacterial inoculation and propionic acid treatment of aerobic stability and microbial populations of ensiled high-moisture ear corn.
AB  - High-moisture ear corn (HMEC) was untreated, treated with propionic acid (PA), or inoculated with a mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium and allowed to ensile in laboratory silos for 0, 7, 21, 42, 138, or 202 d. The silages were evaluated for fermentation quality, microbial populations, and aerobic stability. In all treatments, silage pH declined rapidly within 7 d, but the rate of decline seemed greatest with the inoculum. The lactic acid content of inoculated HMEC was higher (P < .05) than that of control of PA-treated HMEC. Regardless of treatment, the population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased (P < .1) up to 7 to 21 d of fermentation then declined; LAB counts decreased (P < .05) up to 42 d in control and PA-treated silage but continued to decline until 138 d for inoculated silage. Yeast and mold counts tended to decrease up to 42 d of ensiling then decreased (P < .05) as fermentation progressed. Between 138 and 202 d of ensiling, the control silage showed a marked increase (P < .10) in pH and yeast and mold populations, providing evidence of secondary fermentation; PA treatment and bacterial inoculation prevented secondary fermentation. Inoculation tended to reduce estimates of sample temperature for silage stored for 138 d and exposed to air, but not for the corresponding silage stored for 202 d. Treatment with PA prevented the loss (P > .05) of acetic acid and the rise (P > .05) in pH during air exposure of the 138-d silage; both control and PA-treated silage showed an increase (P < .05) in yeast and mold populations, but the increments were 38% and 23%, respectively. Compared with PA, the relative efficacy of inoculation in improving aerobic spoilage of HMEC depended on the period of silo storage and the criterion used to assess aerobic stability.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented Greek  dry salami.
AB  - A total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. The majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus Weissella (120), which was recently proposed (Collins et al., 1993) to include Leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. Meat streptobacteria were identified as Lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and L. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable and, thus designated L. sake/curvatus. Non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as L. plantarum (34 strains), L. farciminis (10), L. coryniformis (1) and L. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). The majority of the Weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as W. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described W. hellenica (Collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled W. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. The latter group comprised strains that produced D(L)-lactate. The remaining Weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to W. minor (31) and W. halotolerans (3). Other species identified were Enterococcus faecium (10), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), L. brevis (1) and Pediococcus sp. (1). The main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.
TI  - The feeding of raw, fermented poultry byproducts: using mink as a model.
AB  - In this study, the safety of fermentation as a method of preservation of raw animal byproducts used for animal nutrition was tested. Two feeding trials with mink, as a model for nonruminant animals, were carried out. In the first trial mink were given a fermented diet composed of raw poultry and fish byproducts supplemented with cereals, glucose, lactic acid, premix, and starter culture (Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium). These mink failed to deliver kits, and 7 of the 30 females in the test group died. At autopsy no specific cause of death could be diagnosed, although all the dead mink showed symptoms of cachexia. In a second trial, a group of mink kits, during the growth period, was given a diet composed of fermented poultry byproducts, just before feeding mixed with raw fish. The weight gain of the mink in the test group decreased statistically compared with that of the control group, mainly for the male members of the group. From the end of October until the beginning of November, during pelt priming, some mink showed symptoms of severe weight loss. It is suggested that the measured increase of amino acid breakdown, and(or) the acidic pH of the fermented diet, caused these unfavorable results. To examine the effect of the fermented diet on the gut flora, fecal samples were analyzed. The fermented diet changed the composition of the gut flora significantly. In the group that received the fermented diet the number of lactobacilli and the mesophilic aerobic count increased and the number of Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci decreased compared with the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Fermentation of raw poultry byproducts for animal nutrition.
AB  - In this study, the fermentation of raw, inedible poultry byproducts mixed with sugarbeet pulp and dextrose and inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum and(or) Enteroccocus faecium resulted in a drop of pH in the byproducts to approximately 4.0 to 4.5 within 48 h. To keep the fermented product stable for a period of 21 d, the addition of > or = 3% (wt/wt) of a fermentable carbohydrate was necessary. With a high inoculation level of approximately 10(8) to 10(9) L. plantarum per gram, or with acidification of the initial mixture with .4% lactic acid, the number of Enterobacteriaceae decreased faster than with inoculation at 10(5) L. plantarum per gram, or without initial acidification. After 21 d of fermentation, a high level of enzymatic breakdown of proteins and amino acids was observed: the nonprotein N level increased from 5% to between 15 and 40% of total N and the volatile N level increased from 1% to between 3 and 11% of total N. An increase in histamine, cadaverine, and putrescine was also observed. Despite the technological measures taken, such as the application of a high inoculum of starter culture and initial acidification with .4% lactic acid, this amino acid breakdown could not be reduced to an acceptable level. These results suggest that, because of biochemical deterioration, fermentation alone is not a useful method of preservation of raw poultry byproducts.
TI  - Sugar uptake and involved enzymatic activities by yeasts and lactic acid bacteria: their relationship with breadmaking quality.
AB  - The uptake kinetics of sugars present in wheat doughs and alpha-glucosidase as well as beta-fructosidase activities were determined in different strains of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. These strains were previously selected according to their breadmaking quality. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (P6), Candida guilliermondii (P40), Lactobacillus plantarum (B31 and La18) and L. brevis (B21) showed good performance, while Sacch. fructuum (P43), L. cellobiosus (B37) and Enterococcus faecium (B11) yielded bread of lower quality. Leuconostoc mesenteroides (B10), when used in combination with other strains led also to high quality starters. All yeast strains used assimilated glucose, fructose and maltose, exhibiting saturable kinetics. Lactic acid bacteria showed saturable kinetics only for hexoses, whereas disaccharide uptake was linear. Sacch. cerevisiae, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. brevis and L. plantarum (B31) displayed better sugar uptake properties. For all the strains used alpha-glucosidase and beta-fructosidase activities were detected. The highest specific activities were found for Sacch. cerevisiae, C. guilliermondii and L. plantarum (B31). These results indicate good correlation between the parameters evaluated and the breadmaking potential of the microorganisms.
