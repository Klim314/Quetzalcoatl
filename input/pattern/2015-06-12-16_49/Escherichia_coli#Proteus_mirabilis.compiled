TI  - Evaluation of the effect of MPL and delivery route on immunogenicity and protectivity of different formulations of FimH and MrpH from uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in a UTI mouse model.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis  are an important cause of morbidity and with the high rate of relapse and spread of multi-drug resistant pathogens, pose a significant public health challenge worldwide. Lack of an efficacious commercial vaccine targeting both uropathogens makes development of a combined vaccine highly desirable. In this study the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of different formulations of FimH of UPEC, MrpH of P. mirabilis and their fusion protein (MrpH.FimH) subcutaneously administered with and without Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvant were evaluated. Our data showed that the subcutaneously administered proteins induced both serum and mucosal IgG, which MPL significantly improved developing a mixed Th1 and Th2 immune response. However, the preparations induced a higher systemic and mucosal IgG and IL-2 levels by this route compared to the intranasal. Immunization of mice with MrpH.FimH fusion with MPL or a mixture of FimH, MrpH and MPL conferred the highest protection of the bladder and kidneys when challenged with UPEC and P. mirabilis in a UTI mouse model. Therefore considering these results MrpH.FimH fusion with MPL administered subcutaneously or intranasally could be a promising vaccine candidate for elimination of UTIs caused by UPEC and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - Characterization of a Highly pH Stable Chi-Class Glutathione S-Transferase from Synechocystis PCC 6803.
AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes present in virtually all organisms. Besides having an essential role in cellular detoxification, they also perform various other functions, including responses in stress conditions and signaling. GSTs are highly studied in plants and animals; however, the knowledge regarding GSTs in cyanobacteria seems rudimentary. In this study, we report the characterization of a highly pH stable GST from the model cyanobacterium- Synechocystis PCC 6803. The gene sll0067 was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the protein was purified to homogeneity. The expressed protein exists as a homo-dimer, which is composed of about 20 kDa subunit. The results of the steady-state enzyme kinetics displayed protein's glutathione conjugation activity towards its class specific substrate- isothiocyanate, having the maximal activity with phenethyl isothiocyanate. Contrary to the poor catalytic activity and low specificity towards standard GST substrates such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene by bacterial GSTs, PmGST B1-1 from Proteus mirabilis, and E. coli GST, sll0067 has broad substrate degradation capability like most of the mammalian GST. Moreover, we have shown that cyanobacterial GST sll0067 is catalytically efficient compared to the best mammalian enzymes. The structural stability of GST was studied as a function of pH. The fluorescence and CD spectroscopy in combination with size exclusion chromatography showed a highly stable nature of the protein over a broad pH range from 2.0 to 11.0. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GST with such a wide range of pH related structural stability. Furthermore, the presence of conserved Proline-53, structural motifs such as N-capping box and hydrophobic staple further aid in the stability and proper folding of cyanobacterial GST- sll0067.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteraemia in haemodialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on renal replacement therapy experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality, infection being the second commonest cause of death. In our haemodialysis population, we identify the pathogens, sensitivity patterns, sources of infection and outcomes of Gram-negative bacteraemia. METHODS: Data from the NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde and NHS Forth Valley haemodialysis population were collected July 2011 to April 2014 through an interrogation of the renal unit electronic patient record, and confirmed by an independent search of the Microbiology database. RESULTS: Over 544 377 haemodialysis days, 84 patients experienced 95 Gram-negative bacteraemia events, a rate of 0.175 events per 1000 haemodialysis days, which varied with dialysis modality: non-tunnelled central venous catheters 4.77, arteriovenous grafts 0.24, tunnelled central venous catheters 0.21, and arteriovenous fistulae 0.11 per 1000 haemodialysis days. The commonest sources of bacteraemia were central venous catheters (CVCs) (16.8%, n = 16), infected ulcers (14.7%, n = 14), urinary (10.5%, n = 10), biliary (9.5%, n = 9) and intra-abdominal (9.5%, n = 9). The principal organisms were Escherichia coli (49.5%, n = 47), Enterobacter spp. (13.1%, n = 13), Klebsiella spp. (11.1%, n = 11), Proteus mirabilis (6.1%, n = 6) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%, n = 5). Of the Enterobacteriaceae (n = 84), 88% were sensitive to gentamicin, 81% to ciprofloxacin, 91% to piperacillin-tazobactam and 100% were sensitive to meropenem. Three-month case mortality was 25.3% (n = 24). Ten patients (11.9%) had more than one Gram-negative bacteraemia; of these, nine patients (90.0%) were the same causative organism, predominantly E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: CVCs and diabetic foot ulcers remain significant risk factors for Gram-negative bacteraemia, highlighting the importance of vascular access planning. Despite good levels of antibiotic sensitivity, the early mortality following Gram-negative bacteraemia remains high, supporting aggressive treatment of such pathogens.
TI  - Comparative Study in Early Neonates with Septicemia by Blood Culture, Staining Techniques and C - Reactive Protein (CRP).
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the pathogenic bacteria in neo-natal septicemia by using various diagnostic techniques. SETTING AND DESIGN: Our study was designed to evaluate a feasible method to diagnose neonatal septicemia even at primary health centre level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected aseptically from 70 neonates. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth and subcultures were performed with specific media. Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion technique and differentiate the isolates by staining methods. C-reactive protein (CRP) was evaluated by using standard kit method. RESULTS: Out of 70 cases of childhood septicemia of age group 1-30 days, 37 had positive CRP, 36 were positive for BCS and blood culture was positive only in 41 cases, where predominant organism being Klebsiella species (n=28, 68.29%) followed by Escherichia coli (n=4, 9.76%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3,7.31%), Proteus mirabilis (n=2,4.88%) and Coagulase negative staphylococcus (n=4,9.76%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Klebsiella species as an important cause of neonatal septicemia. The isolated organisms were found to be highly sensitive to cefatoxime and amikacin. Hence, these antibiotics can be considered as the first drug of choice for neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in Jordan and Lebanon: SMART 2011-2013.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and intra-abdominal infection (IAI) in medical centres of Jordan and Lebanon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli from the SMART study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. These isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. RESULTS: Among the 523 UTI-associated isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 IAI-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). Incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers among UTI-associated E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. Corresponding rates among IAI-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL produced. Seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The alarmingly high rates of ESBL production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.
TI  - Carriage rates and characteristics of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum Beta-lactamases in healthy individuals: comparison of applicants for long-term care and individuals screened for employment purposes.
AB  - AIMS: We compared the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in the faecal samples of 1,109 healthy individuals screened for employment purposes and in 531 asymptomatic individuals applying for long-term care (LTC). METHODS: Eosin-methylene blue agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime were used to determine which individuals were ESBL producers. ESBL phenotype was confirmed by double-disk synergy test and ESBL genes were identified by sequencing. ESBL producers were characterized by co-resistance and integron carriage. RESULTS: ESBL producers were more frequent in the LTC applicants than in the employment screening individuals (7.2 vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), with 43 Escherichia coli, 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca and 1 Proteus mirabilis being found. In the employment screening individuals, only E. coli was found. Most ESBL genes (79.4%, 50/63) were blaCTX-M type; blaCTX-M-15 was more frequent in the LTC applicants (p < 0.001). Regarding ESBL genes and integron diversity, E. coli isolates from the LTC applicants were more similar to K. pneumoniae than to E. coli from the employment screening individuals. CONCLUSION: These differences in the characteristics of ESBL producers may represent different sources of colonization. Most LTC applicants harboured K. pneumoniae or E. coli that were probably hospital-acquired whereas the E. coli isolates of many healthy individuals showed similarities to environmental E. coli.

TI  - Observations on the current bacteriological profile of chronic suppurative otitis media in South eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a disease well-known for its recurrence and persistence despite treatment. The situation is compounded by the increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents by bacteria these days. AIM: This study was carried out to examine the current local bacteriological profile of CSOM and to compare the profile of either ear in bilaterally discharging ears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of ear swab cultures from 133 unilateral and 73 bilateral consecutive tubotympanic CSOM cases seen at the Ear-Nose-Throat clinics of a referral health institution during a 4 year period ending 2013. Sensitivities to eight locally available antibiotics were analyzed. Aerobic bacterial isolates were analyzed separately for the unilateral and bilateral cases. Comparison was made between the ears in the bilateral cases. RESULTS: We analyzed 279 ear swab culture results from 206 patients with age ranging from 5 months to 86 years and a mean of 21.3 (19.5) years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolated bacteria (44% [109/250]) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (17% [42/250]), and Proteus Mirabilis (15% [38/250]). The most and least sensitive bacteria were Klebsiella Spp and Escherichia Coli, respectively. The most effective antibiotics were gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. The two ears differ significantly in the rates of isolation of S. aureus and E. coli (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas is the most common bacteria involved in CSOM in this part of the country. Ciprofloxacin as ear drops is recommended as first-line drug in the management of active CSOM as it is cheap, less ototoxic, and locally available. Separate ear swab culture should be obtained in bilateral CSOM.
TI  - Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.
TI  - Designing of dynamic polyethyleneimine (PEI) brushes on polyurethane (PU) ureteral stents to prevent infections.
AB  - Permanent antibacterial coatings have been developed by brush-like polyethyleneimine (PEI) on polyurethane (PU) ureteral stents since bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation with the following encrustation on stent surface limit their long term usage. In order to control or prevent bacterial infections; PEI chains with two different molecular weights (Mn: 1800 or 60,000Da) were covalently attached on the polyurethane (PU) surface by "grafting to" approach to obtain a brush-like structure. Then, PEI brushes were alkylated with bromohexane to enhance the disruption of bacterial membranes with increasing polycationic character. X-ray Photoelectron and Infrared Spectroscopy investigations confirmed that PEI grafting and alkylation steps were performed successfully. Surface roughness in dry state increased dramatically from 65.8nm to 277.7nm and 145.2nm for short chain PEI and long chain PEI grafted samples, respectively. Both low and high molecular weight PEI grafts exhibited a brush-like structure and potent antibacterial activity by lowering the adherence of Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis species up to two orders of magnitude without any cytotoxic effect on L929 and G/G cells. Thus, permanent bactericidal activity was achieved by the contact-active strategy of dynamic PEI brush-like structures on polyurethane ureteral stent.
TI  - Ceftazidime-Avibactam Activity Tested against Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from U.S. Hospitals (2011 to 2013) and Characterization of beta-Lactamase-Producing Strains.
AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. This compound was active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype isolates. An ESBL phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 Escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 Klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 Proteus mirabilis (4.9%; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. The most common enzymes detected among ESBL phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were CTX-M-15-like (n = 307), KPC (n = 120), SHV ESBLs (n = 118), and CTX-M-14-like (n = 110). KPC producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. Meropenem (MIC50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against CTX-M-producing isolates. Other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. Among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam MIC values of >8 mug/ml, three were K. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam MICs, >32 mug/ml), with two NDM-1 producers and one K. pneumoniae strain carrying the blaKPC-2 and blaVIM-4 genes. Therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing KPC enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.
TI  - Colonization, competition, and dispersal of pathogens in fluid flow networks.
AB  - The colonization of bacteria in complex fluid flow networks, such as those found  in host vasculature, remains poorly understood. Recently, it was reported that many bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis [1], Escherichia coli [2], and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3, 4], can move in the opposite direction of fluid flow. Upstream movement results from the interplay between fluid shear stress and bacterial motility structures, and such rheotactic-like behavior is predicted to occur for a wide range of conditions [1]. Given the potential ubiquity of upstream movement, its impact on population-level behaviors within hosts could be significant. Here, we find that P. aeruginosa communities use a diverse set of motility strategies, including a novel surface-motility mechanism characterized by counter-advection and transverse diffusion, to rapidly disperse throughout vasculature-like flow networks. These motility modalities give P. aeruginosa a selective growth advantage, enabling it to self-segregate from other human pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus that outcompete P. aeruginosa in well-mixed non-flow environments. We develop a quantitative model of bacterial colonization in flow networks, confirm our model in vivo in plant vasculature, and validate a key prediction that colonization and dispersal can be inhibited by modifying surface chemistry. Our results show that the interaction between flow mechanics and motility structures shapes the formation of mixed-species communities and suggest a general mechanism by which bacteria could colonize hosts. Furthermore, our results suggest novel strategies for tuning the composition of multi-species bacterial communities in hosts, preventing inappropriate colonization in medical devices, and combatting bacterial infections.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activities of minocycline and rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces in an in vitro urinary system model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity in urinary catheters and silicones in antibiotic-coated prosthetic urinary systems in order to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by catheter-associated infection. METHODS: The study was initiated in 1993 at Houston, USA and continued in Turkey till 1996. A sterileplastic bag was used as kidney in the in vitro urinary system. Physiological renal jet streams (50 cc/h) were generated with an intravenous metric pump. The temperature was kept at body temperature. The bladder drainage was achieved at the physiological drainage period of 4-6 hours during the 72-hour experiment. Silicone surfaces coated with pure silicone and impregnated with Minocycline-Rifampin were exposed to the urine contaminated with the targeted bacteria in the in vitro urinary model for 72 hours. Antimicrobial activities occurring in the Eosin methylene blue and blood agar media in the infected silicones were assessed. RESULTS: Minocycline-Rifampin silicone surfaces exposed to the urine contaminated with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa reported reproduction. No reproduction was observed in the culture of Minocycline- Rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces for Proteus mirabilis.The difference with the control group was regarded as statistically significant for Proteus mirabilis (p < 0.005). Minocycline-Rifampin-coated silicones were closely monitored only for Proteus mirabilis in the in vitro urinary medium. Although inhibition zones (< 10 mm) in the cultures were observed for Minocycline-Rifampin-coated silicones for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the microbial efficacy was not regarded sufficient. CONCLUSION: There is still need for evidence-based in vivo and in vitro studies where antimicrobial activity is evaluated on the surface of catheters.
TI  - Polyphenolic extract from maple syrup potentiates antibiotic susceptibility and reduces biofilm formation of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Phenolic compounds are believed to be promising candidates as complementary therapeutics. Maple syrup, prepared by concentrating the sap from the North American maple tree, is a rich source of natural and process-derived phenolic compounds. In this work, we report the antimicrobial activity of a phenolic-rich maple syrup extract (PRMSE). PRMSE exhibited antimicrobial activity as well as strong synergistic interaction with selected antibiotics against Gram-negative clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the phenolic constituents of PRMSE, catechol exhibited strong synergy with antibiotics as well as with other phenolic components of PRMSE against bacterial growth. At sublethal concentrations, PRMSE and catechol efficiently reduced biofilm formation and increased the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism for the observed synergy with antibiotics, PRMSE was found to increase outer membrane permeability of all bacterial strains and effectively inhibit efflux pump activity. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that PRMSE significantly repressed multiple-drug resistance genes as well as genes associated with motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. Overall, this study provides a proof of concept and starting point for investigating the molecular mechanism of the reported increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of PRMSE.
TI  - Spectrum of bacterial pathogens and their antibiogram from cases of urinary tract infection among renal disorder patients.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. Resistance to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in UTI. A hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from April 2011 to September 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting KIST Hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of UTI among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. Significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. Incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. Escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), Coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus (CoNS) (5.88%), Enterococcus spp (3.92%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), Proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and Proteus vulgaris (1.00%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.
TI  - Empirical prediction and validation of antibacterial inhibitory effects of various plant essential oils on common pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - In this study, fractional compound composition, antioxidant capacity, and phenolic substance content of 14 plant essential oils-anise (Pimpinella anisum), bay leaves (Laurus nobilis), cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verum), clove (Eugenia caryophyllata), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), hop (Humulus lupulus), Istanbul oregano (Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum), Izmir oregano (Origanum onites), mint (Mentha piperita), myrtus (Myrtus communis), orange peel (Citrus sinensis), sage (Salvia officinalis), thyme (Thymbra spicata), and Turkish oregano (Origanum minutiflorum)--were related to inhibition of 10 bacteria through multiple linear or non-linear (M(N)LR) models-four Gram-positive bacteria of Listeria innocua, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis, and six Gram-negative bacteria of Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Klebsiella oxytoca. A total of 65 compounds with different antioxidant capacity, phenolic substance content and antibacterial properties were detected with 14 plant essential oils. The best-fit M(N)LR models indicated that relative to anise essential oil, the essential oils of oreganos, cinnamon, and thyme had consistently high inhibitory effects, while orange peel essential oil had consistently a low inhibitory effect. Regression analysis indicated that beta-bisabolene (Turkish and Istanbul oreganos), and terpinolene (thyme) were found to be the most inhibitory compounds regardless of the bacteria type tested.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Propagation capacity of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates using a luciferase reporter system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently the use of molecular tools and techniques of Genetic Engineering in the study of microbial behavior in blood components has replaced the employment of classical methods of microbiology. This work focuses on the use of a novel lux reporter system for monitoring the contaminating propagation capacity of bacteria present in platelet concentrates under standard storage conditions in the blood bank. METHODS: A miniTn5 promotor probe carrying the lux operon from Photorhabdus luminiscens (pUTminiTn5luxCDABEKm2) was used to construct four bacterial bioluminescent mutants: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Luminescent mutants were used for contamination tests with 20 CFU in platelet concentrates bags and were stored under standard storage conditions in the blood bank (100 rpm at 22 degrees C). The measurements of luminous activity and optical density were used to monitor bacterial proliferation during 7 days (168 h). RESULTS: During the exponential growth phase (log) of bacterial strains, a lineal correlation between luminous activity vs biomass was observed (R2 = 0.985, 0.976, 0.981) for E. coli::Tn5luxCDABEKm2, P. mirabilis::Tn5luxCDABEKm2 and P. auriginosa::Tn5luxCDABEKm2, respectively. The above indicates that metabolic activity (production of ATP) is directly related to biomass in this phase of microbial growth. While conducting experiments, the inability to propagate S. typhi::Tn5luxCDABEKm2 was detected. We can speculate that platelet concentrates contain specific components that prevent the propagation of S. typhi. CONCLUSION: The use of luxCDABE system for the quantification of luminous activity is a rapid and sensitive alternative to study the propagation and auto-sterilization of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Antifungal Activity of Pelargonium roseum Essential Oils.
AB  - PURPOSE: The antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the XX(th) century. In the current study essential oils obtained from Pelargonium roseum (Geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the Pelargonium essential oil was tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (Candida albicans). Disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. In the case of Candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. In the cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. CONCLUSION: The volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. There were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available Pelargonium oils.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
TI  - Inhibition of quorum sensing mediated biofilm development and virulence in uropathogens by Hyptis suaveolens.
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40 % of all hospital-acquired infections. The bacterial spectrum of nosocomial UTIs is broad and the treatment of UTIs is becoming difficult owing to the emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate novel and alternative therapeutic strategies to treat UTIs. Since UTIs are caused by uropathogens with quorum sensing (QS)-dependent biofilm forming abilities, interruption of QS systems may be a novel approach to combat drug resistance. In the present study, a methanol extract (and hexane extract derived from it) of the medicinal plant Hyptis suaveolens (L.) were shown to have anti-QS activity against the biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC 12472). Furthermore, the hexane extract of H. suaveolens (HEHS) inhibited biofilm formation by uropathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. HEHS promotes the loosening of biofilm architecture and strongly inhibits in vitro biofilm formation by uropathogens, which was more apparent from microscopic images. In addition to this, HEHS reduces the production of QS-dependent virulence factors like protease and hemolysin, along with motility. The partial purification and GC-MS analysis of the active fraction revealed the presence of several therapeutically important compounds which may synergistically act on the uropathogens and possibly reduce the QS-dependent phenotypes. These findings suggest HEHS as potential phytotherapeutic agent which can be employed to formulate protective strategies against biofilm linked infections caused by uropathogens.
TI  - Flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. A total of 545 clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2013. MICs were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampC genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Flomoxef showed excellent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. Moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/mL. Flomoxef showed MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/0.5 mug/mL against MSSA, 0.125/0.25 mug/mL against S. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/mL against S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis and was also potent against MSSA, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Biomaterial modification of urinary catheters with antimicrobials to give long-term broadspectrum antibiofilm activity.
AB  - Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection, accounting for over 100,000 hospital admissions within the USA annually. Biomaterials and processes intended to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of the catheters for long-term users have not been successful, mainly because of the need for long duration of activity in flow conditions. Here we report the results of impregnation of urinary catheters with a combination of rifampicin, sparfloxacin and triclosan. In flow experiments, the antimicrobial catheters were able to prevent colonization by common uropathogens Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for 7 to 12weeks in vitro compared with 1-3days for other, commercially available antimicrobial catheters currently used clinically. Resistance development was minimized by careful choice of antimicrobial combinations. Drug release profiles and distribution in the polymer, and surface analysis were also carried out and the process had no deleterious effect on the mechanical performance of the catheter or its balloon. The antimicrobial catheter therefore offers for the first time a means of reducing infection and its complications in long-term urinary catheter users.
TI  - High prevalence of CTX-M-15 and first report of CTX-M-3, CTX-M-22, CTX-M-28 and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae causing urinary tract infections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in hospital and community settings.
AB  - AIM: To investigate molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase/ESBL and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase/pAmpC producing Gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the period Decembar 2009-May 2010. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion and broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. Double-disk synergy test was performed in order to screen for ESBLs/pAmpC beta-lactamases. PCR was used to detect bla(ESBL)/bla(ampC)/bla(carb) genes. Genetic relatedness of the strains was determined by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Among 85 patients with UTIs caused by ESBL producing isolates, 44 (51.8%) were from in-patients and 41 (48.2%) from outpatients. Klebsiella spp. was the most frequently isolated from in-patients, in 28 (63.6%) cases. Among outpatients, Klebsiella spp./Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated, in 19 (46.3%)/16 (39.0%) cases. Twenty-one (75.0%) from hospital and nine (47.4%) from outpatient Klebsiella spp. isolates were positive for blaTEM, whereas 27 (96.4%) from in-patients and 6 (31.6%) from outpatient were bla(CTX-M) positive (18 hospital and five outpatient isolates were encoding bla(CTX-M-15)). One Klebsiella oxytoca and one Enterobacter cloacae inpatient isolates were positive for blaCTX-M-28. One Klebsiella pneumoniae outpatient isolate were positive for bla(CTX-M-22) and one E. coli for bla(CTX-M-3). One hospital Proteus mirabilis strain was positive for bla(CMY-2) and two Klebsiella spp. strains for blaDHA-1, whereas two E. coli, one K. oxytoca and one Proteus vulgaris outpatient strains were positive for bla(CMY-2). CONCLUSION: Identification of bla(CTX-M-3), bla(CTX-M-22) and bla(CTX-M-28) among Enterobacteriaceae is uncommon. In this study we report the emergency of CMY-2 and DHA-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts and isoquinoline alkaloids of selected papaveraceae plants.
AB  - Alkaloidal extracts of seven selected plants of the family Papaveraceae were studied with respect to their activity against six strains of pathogenic bacteria and their alkaloidal fingerprint. Twenty-four alkaloids were determined by GC/MS, and twenty of them identified from their mass spectra, retention times and retention indexes. In the antibacterial assay, three Gram-positive (Enterorococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. hyicus), and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used. The most promising antimicrobial activity was shown by the alkaloidal extract of Macleaya cordata with MIC values of 16 mug/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 32 mug/mL for Enterococcus faecalis and 64 mug/mL for Staphylococcus hyicus and Escherichia coli. All the tested pure isoquinoline alkaloids were considered inactive within the tested concentrations.
TI  - Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Gram-Negative Pathogenic Bacteria Species Isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches are among the medically important pests found within the  human habitations that cause serious public health problems. They may harbor a number of pathogenic bacteria on the external surface with antibiotic resistance. Hence, they are regarded as major microbial vectors. This study investigates the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria species isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India. METHODS: Totally, 203 adult cockroaches were collected form 44 households and 52 food-handling establishments by trapping. Bacteriological examination of external surfaces of Pe. americana and Bl. germanica were carried out using standard method and antibiotics susceptibility profiles of the isolates were determined using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods. RESULTS: Among the places, we found that 54% had cockroache infestation in households and 77% in food- handling establishments. There was no significant different between the overall bacteria load of the external surface in Pe. americana (64.04%) and Bl. germanica (35.96%). However the predominant bacteria on cockroaches were Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, Kl. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were the most prevalent, drug-resistant strains were isolated from the cockroaches with 100% resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin. For individual strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli was found to have multi-resistance to four antibiotic tested, Citrobacter freundii four, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis to three. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches are uniformly distributed in domestic environment, which can be a possible vector for transmission of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne diseases.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with normal  and altered glycated hemoglobin levels in two regions in Brazil.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with regard to the management of diabetes, assessed using glycated hemoglobin levels. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using conjunctival smears of diabetic patients from both sexes and with different ages, residing in two different Brazilian cities (Sorocaba and Rio Branco). A control group of non-diabetic patients was also included. The diabetic patients were considered to have controlled diabetes when their glycated hemoglobin level was </=7% and blood glucose level was </=126 mg/dL. Patients with non-controlled diabetes were those with glycated hemoglobin levels >7% and blood glucose levels >126 mg/dL. The samples obtained were inoculated in Brain-Heart Infusion broth and in culture media for aerobic bacteria (blood and chocolate agars); bacterial growth was evaluated in a microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 120 eyes of 120 patients were included in the present study. The percentage of cultures in which bacterial growth was observed was greater in diabetic patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.103). There was a greater trend toward bacterial growth in the conjunctiva of diabetic patients with altered fasting blood glucose. There was no difference in the frequency of bacterial growth on the conjunctiva between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. In Sorocaba, conjunctival bacterial growth was similar to that observed in Rio Branco. The microorganism most frequently detected in the present study was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: There was no difference between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. The microorganisms found were similar to those found in studies investigating the conjunctival bacterial flora of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
TI  - Identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  - Chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. It is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. A number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. The isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Proteus mirabilis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), group G beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). In comparison to the other isolates, P. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by S. aureus, with insignificant differences between MRSA and non-methicillin resistant isolates. The Enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. The isolation of MRSA, ESBL-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. This study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. However, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.
TI  - [The urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  - Twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. Single-J ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. Pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. Forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients. Thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Proteus (P.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. One methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strain was isolated. Thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. E. faecalis (23.1%), Eschericia (E.) coli (23.1%) and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. One E. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and one MRCNS strain were isolated. Pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. The patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). P. aeruginosa (26.9%), E. faecium (15.4%), and P. mirabilis (11.5%) were isolated inhigh frequency. One E. coli strain harboring ESBL and one P. mirabilis strain harboring ESBL were isolated. In conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and comparators against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in China.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 401 ESBL-producing isolates, including 196 Escherichia coli, 124 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 81 Proteus mirabilis, were collected consecutively from 21 hospitals in China in 2013. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. Phenotypic identification of ESBL production was detected as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). ESBL genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. Flomoxef, doripenem, meropenem, ertapenem, cefmetazole and piperacillin/tazobactam exhibited good activity against ESBL-producing isolates, with susceptibility rates >90%. Tigecycline showed good activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae (100% and 97.6%, respectively). Cefotaxime and cefepime showed very low activities against ESBL-producing isolates, with susceptibility rates of 0-0.8% and 1.0-13.6%, respectively. blaCTX-M were the major ESBL genes, with occurrence in 99.5% of E. coli, 91.1% of K. pneumoniae and 97.5% of P. mirabilis. blaCTX-M-14 was the predominant ESBL gene, detected in 46.9% (188/401) of the isolates, followed by blaCTX-M-15 (21.4%), blaCTX-M-55 (17.2%), blaCTX-M-65 (12.7%) and blaCTX-M-3 (6.7%). Flomoxef exhibited excellent activity against the different CTX-M-type ESBL-producing isolates, with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.064-0.125mug/mL and 0.25-0.5mug/mL, respectively. Against the isolates solely producing CTX-M-14, -15, -55, -3 or -65, flomoxef showed susceptibility rates of 98.6%, 98.0%, 98.1%, 100.0% and 97.4%, respectively. In conclusion, flomoxef showed good activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and may be a choice to treat infections caused by these isolates in China.
TI  - Detection of blaCTX-M-type genes in complex class 1 integrons carried by Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat in Brazil.
AB  - CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been increasingly identified in humans and animals, and their potential transmission by contaminated food has been highlighted. In this study, we report for the first time the isolation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains harboring blaCTXM-2 or blaCTXM-8 gene variants in chicken meat sold in markets in southeast Brazil. In this regard, the genetic environment of the blaCTX-M-2 gene is composed of a complex class 1 integron and an ISCR1-associated sequence with dfr and/or aadA gene cassettes located within the variable region. In summary, chicken meat may be a reservoir of MDR Enterobacteriaceae harboring blaCTX-M-type genes, which is a public health concern.
TI  - Preferential use of central metabolism in vivo reveals a nutritional basis for polymicrobial infection.
AB  - The human genitourinary tract is a common anatomical niche for polymicrobial infection and a leading site for the development of bacteremia and sepsis. Most uncomplicated, community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI) are caused by Escherichia coli, while another bacterium, Proteus mirabilis, is more often associated with complicated UTI. Here, we report that uropathogenic E. coli and P. mirabilis have divergent requirements for specific central pathways in vivo despite colonizing and occupying the same host environment. Using mutants of specific central metabolism enzymes, we determined glycolysis mutants lacking pgi, tpiA, pfkA, or pykA all have fitness defects in vivo for P. mirabilis but do not affect colonization of E. coli during UTI. Similarly, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is required only for P. mirabilis in vivo. In contrast, gluconeogenesis is required only for E. coli fitness in vivo. The remarkable difference in central pathway utilization between E. coli and P. mirabilis during experimental UTI was also observed for TCA cycle mutants in sdhB, fumC, and frdA. The distinct in vivo requirements between these pathogens suggest E. coli and P. mirabilis are not direct competitors within host urinary tract nutritional niche. In support of this, we found that co-infection with E. coli and P. mirabilis wild-type strains enhanced bacterial colonization and persistence of both pathogens during UTI. Our results reveal that complementary utilization of central carbon metabolism facilitates polymicrobial disease and suggests microbial activity in vivo alters the host urinary tract nutritional niche.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of well waters in Samaru, Zaria, Kaduna, State, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Majority of the human population in semi-urban and urban areas in Nigeria are heavily reliant on well water as the main source of water supply for drinking and domestic use due to inadequate provision of potable pipe borne water. These groundwater sources can easily be fecally contaminated and thus, increase the incidence and outbreaks of preventable waterborne diseases. This study was carried out to determine the bacteriological quality of some well waters in Samaru, Z. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samaru, Zaria located in Northern Nigeria, is a semi-urban university satellite town blessed with abundant ground and surface water. Five sampling sites were randomly selected for this study. A total of 10 samples: Two from each of the sites were collected fortnightly for 1 month (May-June, 2013). Samples were analyzed using presumptive multiple tube fermentation and confirmatory tests for total and fecal coliforms. The well water samples were also cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio chole. RESULTS: The total coliform count for all the samples analyzed was >180+/100 ml. All the well water samples from the study locations were contaminated with one or more bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli 20%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 100% and Proteus mirabilis 40%. Salmonella, Shigella, or V. cholerae were not isolated from any of the well water samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study showed contamination of all the wells studied with fecal coliforms thus, indicating the possible presence of other enteric pathogens and a potential source for waterborne disease outbreaks. Well water in Samaru is not safe for drinking without additional treatment like disinfection or boiling. Periodic testing and constant monitoring of well waters should also be done to meet up with the World Health Organization Standards in the provision of safe, clean drinking water .
TI  - Intranasal immunization with fusion protein MrpH.FimH and MPL adjuvant confers protection against urinary tract infections caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and Proteus mirabilis are among the most common infections in the world. Currently there are no vaccines available to confer protection against UTI in humans. In this study, the immune responses and protection of FimH of UPEC with MrpH antigen of P. mirabilis in different vaccine formulations with and without MPL adjuvant were assessed. Mice intranasally immunized with the novel fusion protein MrpH.FimH induced a significant increase in IgG and IgA in serum, nasal wash, vaginal wash, and urine samples. Mice immunized with fusion MrpH.FimH also showed a significant boost in cellular immunity. Addition of MPL as the adjuvant enhanced FimH and MrpH specific humoral and cellular responses in both systemic and mucosal samples. Vaccination with MrpH.FimH alone or in combination with MPL showed the highest efficiency in clearing bladder and kidney infections in mice challenged with UPEC and P. mirabilis. These findings may indicate that the protection observed correlates with the systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses induced by vaccination with these preparations. Our data suggest MrpH.FimH fusion protein with or without MPL as adjuvant could be potential vaccine candidates for elimination of UPEC and P. mirabilis. These data altogether are promising and these formulations are good candidates for elimination of UPEC and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Preparation and characterization of new biologically active polyurethane foams.
AB  - Biologically active polyurethane foams are the fast-developed alternative to many applications of biomedical materials. Due to the polyurethane structure features and foam technology it is possible to incorporate into their structure the biologically active compounds of target purpose via structural-chemical modification of macromolecule. A series of new biologically active polyurethane foams (PUFs) was synthesized with polyethers (MM 2500-5000), polyesters MM (500-2200), 2,4(2,6) toluene diisocyanate, water as a foaming agent, catalysts, foam stabilizers and functional compounds. Different functional compounds: 1,4-di-N-oxy-2,3-bis-(oxymethyl)-quinoxaline (DOMQ), partial sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) and 2,6-dimethyl-N,N-diethyl aminoacetatanilide hydrochloride were incorporated into the polymer structure/composition due to the chemical and/or physical bonding. Structural peculiarities of PUFs were studied by FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray scattering. Self-adhesion properties of PUFs were estimated by measuring of tensile strength at break of adhesive junction. The optical microscopy method was performed for the PUF morphology studies. Toxicological estimation of the PUFs was carried out in vitro and in vivo. The antibacterial action towards the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATC 25922, E. coli ATC 2150, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6447, Staphylococcus aureus 180, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8180, Proteus mirabilis F 403, P. mirabilis 6054, and Proteus vulgaris 8718) was studied by the disc method on the solid nutrient. Physic-chemical properties of the PUFs (density, tensile strength and elongation at break, water absorption and vapor permeability) showed that all studied PUFs are within the operational requirements for such materials and represent fine-cellular foams. Spectral studies confirmed the incorporation of DOMQ into the PUF's macrochain. PUFs are characterized by microheterogeneous structure. They are antibacterially active, non-toxic materials with high affinity to the tissue body, self-adhesive properties and local anesthetic effect.
TI  - Enterobacteria identification and detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in  a Port Complex.
AB  - The Port Complex of Maranhao (PCM) is the second largest port complex in Brazil,  receiving ships with large volumes of ballast water. To evaluate the microbiological quality of its waters, physicochemical parameters (pH and salinity), the number of coliforms (thermotolerants and totals), and the presence of enterobacterias and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains were analyzed. In order to identify the presence of E. coli virulence genes target regions of the stx, elt, est, aggR, CVD432, ipaH and eae nucleotide sequences were studied. The presence of totals and thermotolerants coliforms were positive. Analyzing the salinity parameter, a significant increase in total coliforms was observed during the rainy season. We identified the species Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Edwardsiella tarda. Out of the 51 E. coli isolated, two were positive for the elt gene and one was positive for the CVD432 sequence, features of enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains, respectively. This study reveals that the PCM is contaminated by enterobacteria and diarrheagenic E.coli thus providing evidence regarding the risk of these bacteria being carried by ships to other countries, and draws attention to the input of fecal bacteria brought by ships in the port waters of Maranhao.
TI  - Flow cytometry analysis using sysmex UF-1000i classifies uropathogens based on bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens among patients with urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common bacterial infection. Urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but new techniques, such as flow cytometry analysis (FCA), have been introduced. The aim of the present study was to evaluate FCA characteristics regarding bacteriuria, leukocyturia, and erythrocyturia in relation to cultured uropathogens in specimens from patients with a suspected UTI. We also wanted to evaluate whether the FCA characteristics can identify uropathogens prior to culture. From a prospective study, 1,587 consecutive urine specimens underwent FCA prior to culture during January and February 2012. Outpatients and inpatients (79.6% and 19.4%, respectively) were included, of whom women represented 67.5%. In total, 620 specimens yielded growth, of which Escherichia coli represented 65%, Enterococcus spp. 8%, Klebsiella spp. 7%, and Staphylococcus spp. 5%. For the uropathogens, the outcome of FCA was compared against the results for specimens with E. coli and those with a negative culture. E. coli had high bacterial (median, 17,914/mul), leukocyte (median, 348/mul), and erythrocyte (median, 23/mul) counts. With the exception of Klebsiella spp., the majority of the uropathogens had considerable or significantly lower bacterial counts than that of E. coli. High leukocyte counts were found in specimens with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group C streptococci. Elevated erythrocyte counts were found for P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and group C streptococci, as well as for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. In essence, FCA adds new information about the bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens for different uropathogens. Based on FCA characteristics, uropathogens can be classified and identified prior to culture. E. coli and Klebsiella spp. have similar FCA characteristics.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  - A series of novel Zn(II) complexes [Zn2(nap)4] (1), [Zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [Zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [Zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [Zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [Zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using IR, UV-Vis, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (G(+)) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus) and (G(-)) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. Complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. All the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. The complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment. This is considered an important target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.
TI  - [Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in a child with severe malnutrition and recurrent fever].
AB  - Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare inflammatory disease, characterized  by replacement of renal parenchyma with granulomatous tissue. Initial clinical presentation includes abdominal pain and constitutional symptoms related to recurrent urinary infections. The microorganisms most commonly involved are Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Final diagnosis is made by histopathology, and the only curative treatment is total or partial nephrectomy. A recently diagnosed case in our unit is presented, as well as an update on the knowledge of this disease.
TI  - beta-lactamases produced by amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant enterobacteria isolated in Buenos Aires, Argentina: a new blaTEM gene.
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors in enterobacteria is a growing problem that has not been intensively studied in Argentina. In the present work, 54/843 enterobacteria collected in a teaching hospital of Buenos Aires city were ampicillin-sulbactam-resistant isolates remaining susceptible to second- and third-generation cephalosporins. The enzymatic mechanisms present in the isolates, which were also amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC)-resistant (18/54) were herein analyzed. Sequencing revealed two different variants of blaTEM-1, being blaTEM-1b the most frequently detected allelle (10 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Raoultella terrigena) followed by blaTEM-1a (1 K. pneumoniae). Amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance seems to be mainly associated with TEM-1 overproduction (mostly in E. coli) or co-expressed with OXA-2-like and/or SHV beta-lactamases (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis). A new blaTEM variant (TEM-163) was described in an E. coli strain having an AMC MIC value of 16/8mug/ml. TEM-163 contains Arg275Gln and His289Leu amino acid substitutions. On the basis of the high specific activity and low IC50 for clavulanic acid observed, the resistance pattern seems to be due to overproduction of the new variant of broad spectrum beta-lactamase rather than to an inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-like behavior.
TI  - Wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - Microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. These microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. The use of natural products has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. The present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. Four Gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of Russula delica, Fistulina hepatica, Mycena rosea, Leucopaxilus giganteus, and Lepista nuda extracts. The results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). Among the five tested extracts against E. coli, Leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and Mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. The extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon P. mirabilis biofilm formation were Sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and Russula delica (53.1%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by Russula delica extract). This is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.
TI  - Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  - Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria Escherichia coli are live biotherapeutics for UTI.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for approximately 8 million clinic visits  annually with symptoms that include acute pelvic pain, dysuria, and irritative voiding. Empiric UTI management with antimicrobials is complicated by increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens, but live biotherapeutics products (LBPs), such as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) strains of E. coli, offer the potential to circumvent antimicrobial resistance. Here we evaluated ASB E. coli as LBPs, relative to ciprofloxacin, for efficacy against infection and visceral pain in a murine UTI model. Visceral pain was quantified as tactile allodynia of the pelvic region in response to mechanical stimulation with von Frey filaments. Whereas ciprofloxacin promoted clearance of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), it did not reduce pelvic tactile allodynia, a measure of visceral pain. In contrast, ASB E. coli administered intravesically or intravaginally provided comparable reduction of allodynia similar to intravesical lidocaine. Moreover, ASB E. coli were similarly effective against UTI allodynia induced by Proteus mirabilis, Enterococccus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Therefore, ASB E. coli have anti-infective activity comparable to the current standard of care yet also provide superior analgesia. These studies suggest that ASB E. coli represent novel LBPs for UTI symptoms.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Infected hydatid cysts bacteria in slaughtered livestock and their effects on protoscoleces degeneration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protoscoleces of fertile hydatid cysts are considered as major risks in surgery and producing secondary cysts if rupture the cyst during operation and, cause infecting the dogs with adult worm if eaten by this animal. Bacterial infection of the hydatid fluid can lead to sterilization of the cyst. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial infection rate of livestock hydatid cysts in Hamedan, Iran, and test the isolated bacteria effects on viable protoscoleces, in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 5709 slaughtered livestock were inspected to detect the presence of hydatid cysts. The hydatid fluid of all cysts was cultured separately to isolate and identify the bacteria. The effect of isolated bacteria was tested on viable protoscoleces in culture tubes, in vitro. The culture tubes were observed and examined under a light microscope every two hours for 24 hours, and then, after 36 and 48 hours. RESULTS: Infected cysts were found in 74% of animals in Hamedan (46% were calcified and the bacteria was isolated from 52%) and 62% in Borujerd. The isolated bacteria in the infected cysts were as follows: Escherichia coli, E. blattae, Klebsiella pnoumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Edwardsiella tarda. The protoscoleces incubated with the isolated bacteria totally degenerated, but 55% of the protoscoleces in the control groups were intact and viable even after one week. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a high percentage of cysts bacterial infections in two provinces of Iran. The common isolated bacteria were E. coli and Klebsiella. The isolated bacteria degenerated the protoscoleces during short-time incubation, in vitro.
TI  - The preliminary assessment of anti-microbial activity of HPLC separated components of Kirkia wilmsii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most communities in developing countries rely on traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases. In South Africa, the Limpopo province, within the Lebowakgomo district, uses tuberous roots of Kirkia wilmsii, after infusion in water for the treatment of a wide range of diseases by Sotho communities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main objective of the study was to assess the anti-microbial activity of separated aqueous components of the Kirkia wilmsii tuberous roots. The clear aqueous extracts that were obtained after a 0.45 microm membrane filtration (Millipore Millex-HV Hydrophillic PVDF filter), were then injected into a preparative high performance liquid chromatography instrument in which pure components, as shown by peaks, were collected and evaluated for anti-microbial activity against a range of microorganisms. RESULTS: The eight separated components were obtained, out of which four components showed anti-microbial activity (AMA). The freeze dried components were re-dissolved in deionised water and then evaluated for AMA against Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Enterobacter aerogenes. Component one exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), of 3.445 mg/ml. Component five was only active against Proteus mirabilis with a MIC of 0.08 mg/ml. Component 7, was active against Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 0.365 mg/ml against both Shigella dysenteriae and Staphylococcus aureus and 0.091 mg/ml against Escherichia coli. Component 8, was active against Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli with a MIC of 155 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Only four out of eight aqueous extracts showed AMA against both gram negative and positive bacteria and showed no AMA against Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes and Vibrio cholerae. Therefore the Kirkia wilmsii plant root may be used as a broad spectrum antibiotic.
TI  - Loss of FliL alters Proteus mirabilis surface sensing and temperature-dependent swarming.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a dimorphic motile bacterium well known for its flagellum-dependent swarming motility over surfaces. In liquid, P. mirabilis cells are 1.5- to 2.0-mum swimmer cells with 4 to 6 flagella. When P. mirabilis encounters a solid surface, where flagellar rotation is limited, swimmer cells differentiate into elongated (10- to 80-mum), highly flagellated swarmer cells. In order for P. mirabilis to swarm, it first needs to detect a surface. The ubiquitous but functionally enigmatic flagellar basal body protein FliL is involved in P. mirabilis surface sensing. Previous studies have suggested that FliL is essential for swarming through its involvement in viscosity-dependent monitoring of flagellar rotation. In this study, we constructed and characterized DeltafliL mutants of P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Unexpectedly and unlike other fliL mutants, both P. mirabilis and E. coli DeltafliL cells swarm (Swr(+)). Further analysis revealed that P. mirabilis DeltafliL cells also exhibit an alteration in their ability to sense a surface: e.g., DeltafliL P. mirabilis cells swarm precociously over surfaces with low viscosity that normally impede wild-type swarming. Precocious swarming is due to an increase in the number of elongated swarmer cells in the population. Loss of fliL also results in an inhibition of swarming at <30 degrees C. E. coli DeltafliL cells also exhibit temperature-sensitive swarming. These results suggest an involvement of FliL in the energetics and function of the flagellar motor.
TI  - Protective immunity induced by the vaccination of recombinant Proteus mirabilis OmpA expressed in Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) is a zoonotic pathogen that has recently presented a rising infection rate in the poultry industry. To develop an effective vaccine to protect chickens against P. mirabilis infection, OmpA, one of the major outer membrane proteins of P. mirabilis, was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The concentration of the expressed recombinant OmpA protein reached 8.0mug/mL after induction for 96h with 1.0% methanol in the culture. In addition, OmpA protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the antibody against Escherichia coli-expressed OmpA protein. Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide, a known plant-derived adjuvant, was mixed into the recombinant OmpA protein to prepare the OmpA subunit vaccine. We then subcutaneously inoculated this vaccine into chickens to examine the immunoprotective effects. ELISA analysis indicated that an excellent antibody response against OmpA was elicited in the vaccinated chickens. Moreover, a high protection rate of 80.0% was observed in the vaccinated group, which was subsequently challenged with P. mirabilis. The results suggest that the eukaryotic P. mirabilis OmpA was an ideal candidate protein for developing an effective subunit vaccine against P. mirabilis infection.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of selected medicinal plants against multidrug resistant bacterial strains from clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of Curcuma longa (C. longa), Zingiber officinale (Z. officinale) and Tinospora cordifolia (T. cordifolia) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis of clinical origin. METHODS: The antimicrobial efficacy of said medicinal plants and establishment of multidrug resistant character of these bacteria were carried out using disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. RESULTS: The results of MIC and MBC showed that these clinical bacterial isolates were phenotypically multidrug resistant against standard antibiotics (>500 mug/mL). Compared to standard antibiotics, C. longa, Z. officinale and T. cordifolia were more effective in killing these microbes as evident from MIC and MBC values (5 to 125 mug/mL). Moreover, C. longa had highest antibacterial efficacy compared to Z. officinale and T. cordifolia. CONCLUSIONS: The result thus obtained suggests that bioactive principles of these plants can be used particularly against these multidrug resistant bacteria of clinical origin.
TI  - Epidemiology of Enterobacteriaceae producing CTX-M type extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL).
AB  - Over the past 20 years, some Enterobacteriaceae mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis have demonstrated acquisition of plasmids secreting ESBL. CTX-M type ESBL have been isolated worldwide and their incidence has increased dramatically and is still increasing leading to a major therapeutic issue. Currently more than 150 allelic variants of CTX-M have been identified. These enzymes are classified in five major phylogenetic groups based on their gene sequences: CTX-M -1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-25; two additional groups have been reported recently: CTX-M-74 and CTX-M-75. The important dissemination of these enzymes has led to an increased use of carbapenems. Their global community and nosocomial dissemination is often associated with a virulent E. coli clone ST131 producing CTX-M-15.
TI  - [Phenotypic detection of beta-lactamases production in Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly used antibacterial drugs. However, many bacteria have developed resistance to these antibiotics, and the most common form of resistance is the production of beta-lactamase enzymes. Many members of the Enterobacteriaceae family produce different types of these enzymes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform phenotypic detection of production and identification of beta-lactamase type in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from different clinical specimens from patients hospitalized in the Clinical Center of Serbia. METHODS: The strains of Enterobacteriaceae were collected between November 2011 and January 2012 in the laboratory of the Clinical Center of Serbia.The isolates were identified according to the standard microbiology procedures and confirmed by the Vitek2 automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method, and the phenotypic detection of production and identification of beta-lactamases was performed according to previously described methodologies. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 172 Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated. Further testing was performed on 54/145 (37.2%) strains showing decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics: 13/85 (15.3%) Escherichia coli, 31/46 (67.4%) Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10/14 (71.4%) Proteus mirabilis. Among them, 40/145 (27.6%) strains produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), 9/145 (6.2%)--AmpC, 1/145 (0.7%)--K1 beta-lactamase and 4/145 (2.8%)--carbapenemases. Carbapenemases were predominantly detected in K. pneumoniae (75%). CONCLUSION: Enterobacteriaceae produce different types of beta-lactamases, and the most common type in our study was ESBLs. Production of carbapenemases detected in Enterobacteriaceae is also an associated problem.
TI  - Burdock root extracts limit quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes and biofilm architecture in major urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are serious concern in patients infected with urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections and other device-associated infections. Microbes within the biofilms are effectively shielded from antibiotics and host immune cells, hence can be treated only with agents which has the potential to disassemble the biofilms. The study is focused on the root extracts of Arctium lappa Linn. as a source for complementary medicine against three major biofilm forming clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens. Methanol extracts of burdock roots (BR) showed no bactericidal activity (p > 0.05) against the uropathogens, whereas restrained the biofilms (p < 0.05) on polystyrene and glass surfaces at a biofilm inhibitory concentration of 100 microg/mL. The 3D confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to analyze the biofilm architecture which showed significant reduction in the surface area. Z-stack analysis has also revealed substantial reduction in the biofilm thickness (E. coli-50.79%, P. mirabilis-69.49%, and S. marcescens-75.84%). Further, BR extracts also inhibited quorum-sensing (QS)-controlled cellular phenotypes such as violacein, prodigiosin, swarming motility, and cell surface hydrophobicity. LC-MS/MS analysis of BR extracts identified the presence of two major quercetin derivatives (miquelianin and peltatoside) along with few other constituent components. Exploring such phytocompounds will provide potential agents to treat infections caused by biofilm forming uropathogens. The antibiofilm and anti-QS agents will ultimately serve as armor, facilitating the host immune system to fight infections.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from carrageenan.
AB  - Carrageenan films have been formulated as a packaging material. Films plasticized with glycerol were loaded with citric acid (1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 %) for enhanced antimicrobial effects. Blank and citric acid loaded films were characterized by mechanical properties, scanning electron microscopy and contact angle. In addition, swelling and antibacterial studies were conducted to further characterize the films. Both blank and citric acid loaded films showed different morphology, high elasticity and acceptable tensile (mechanical) properties. These citric acid loaded films produced higher zones of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Dickeya chrysanthemi strains compared to blank film.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Strain diversity of CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae in individual pigs: insights into the dynamics of shedding during the production cycle.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the population dynamics of CTX-M-producing  Enterobacteriaceae in individual pigs on a farm positive for CTX-M-14-producing Escherichia coli. Fecal samples were collected once around the farrowing time from five sows and four times along the production cycle from two of their respective offspring. Multiple colonies per sample were isolated on cefotaxime-supplemented MacConkey agar with or without prior enrichment, resulting in 98 isolates identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and tested for blaCTX-M. CTX-M-positive isolates (n = 86) were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Plasmids harboring blaCTX-M were characterized in 22 representative isolates by replicon typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Based on the PFGE results, all individuals shed unrelated CTX-M-14-producing E. coli strains during the course of life. Concomitant shedding of CTX-M-2/97-producing Proteus mirabilis or Providencia rettgeri was observed in two sows and two offspring. At least two genetically unrelated CTX-M-producing E. coli strains were isolated from approximately one-fourth of the samples, with remarkable differences between isolates obtained by enrichment and direct plating. A clear decrease in strain diversity was observed after weaning. Dissemination of blaCTX-M-14 within the farm was attributed to horizontal transfer of an IncK plasmid that did not carry additional resistance genes and persisted in the absence of antimicrobial selective pressure. Assessment of strain diversity was shown to be influenced by the production stage from which samples were collected, as well as by the isolation method, providing useful information for the design and interpretation of future epidemiological studies of CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae in pig farms.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Structural and functional features of Crl proteins and identification of conserved surface residues required for interaction with the RpoS/sigmaS subunit of RNA polymerase.
AB  - In many gamma-proteobacteria, the RpoS/sigmaS sigma factor associates with the core RNAP (RNA polymerase) to modify global gene transcription in stationary phase and under stress conditions. The small regulatory protein Crl stimulates the association of sigmaS with the core RNAP in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, through direct and specific interaction with sigmaS. The structural determinants of Crl involved in sigmaS binding are unknown. In the present paper we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Proteus mirabilis Crl protein (CrlPM) and a structural model for Salmonella Typhimurium Crl (CrlSTM). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays, we demonstrated that CrlSTM and CrlPM are structurally similar and perform the same biological function. In the Crl structure, a cavity enclosed by flexible arms contains two patches of conserved and exposed residues required for sigmaS binding. Among these, charged residues that are likely to be involved in electrostatic interactions driving Crl-sigmaS complex formation were identified. CrlSTM and CrlPM interact with domain 2 of sigmaS with the same binding properties as with full-length sigmaS. These results suggest that Crl family members share a common mechanism of sigmaS binding in which the flexible arms of Crl might play a dynamic role.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship studies of microbiologically active thiosemicarbazides derived from hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazides.
AB  - Forty-five derivatives of thiosemicarbazide were synthesized, and their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. Some of the described compounds exhibited interesting activity against reference strains of Gram-positive bacteria, whereas only two derivatives had the ability to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative species (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12453). The most potent antimicrobial activity was observed in the cases of salicylic acid hydrazide derivatives. The differences in activity inspired us to conduct conformational analysis using molecular mechanics level. The obtained results suggest that the molecule geometry, especially at the N4-terminus of thiosemicarbazide skeleton, determines the antibacterial activity. Unfortunately, in opposition to what we expected, only one of the tested compounds inhibited the activity of the topoIV enzyme, and none of them was active against DNA gyrase.
TI  - Antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. An important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. This study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the University Hospital Olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. METHODS: For the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011, resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. For the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (DDDatb) based on the ATC/DDD classification and in relative annual consumption (RDDDatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. The relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using Spearman's correlation. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 113,027 isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. There was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and amikacin in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Also, there was significant correlation between resistance to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. No relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.
TI  - Role of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  - Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. Recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (rUTI) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. For patients, rUTI is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality of life. Standard treatment of rUTI is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. Repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase of resistance of uropathogenic strains. According to the European Association of Urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". Our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention of rUTI. Total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our open-label post-marketing trial. Each patient had more than one year history of rUTI and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. The trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R) together with the standard antibacterial medication. According to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by Escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. Each woman was involved as the intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. The women received only vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R). 65 patients of the control group had more than one year history of rUTI and had been treated earlier, too. Patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without Solco-Urovac(R). After therapy and follow-up examination, results in the both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. During the follow-up period no case of rUTI was noticed in women. In total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of rUTI in 46 patients during the follow-up period. Altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. Through comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of rUTI episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of Solco-Urovac(R). The results of our post-marketing trial allow recommending Solco-Urovac(R) for appropriate reference within the Georgian National Guideline on Urologic Infections.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular characterization of plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolated from urinary tract infections in Egyptian hospitals.
AB  - The incidence of resistance by Enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors combination is increasing in Egypt. Three phenotypic techniques, comprising AmpC disk diffusion and inhibition dependent methods using phenylboronic acid (PBA) and cloxacillin, were compared to PCR based method for detection of plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in common urinary tract isolates. A total of 143 isolates, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis, were collected from urinary tract infections cases in Egyptian hospitals. Plasmid encoded AmpC genes were detected by PCR in 88.46% of cefoxitin resistant isolates. The most prevalent AmpC gene family was CIT including CMY-2, CMY-4, and two CMY-2 variants. The second prevalent gene was DHA-1 which was detected in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia. The genes EBC, FOX, and MOX were also detected but in small percentage. Some isolates were identified as having more than one pAmpC gene. The overall sensitivity and specificity of phenotypic tests for detection of AmpC beta-lactamase showed that AmpC disk diffusion and inhibition dependent method by cloxacillin were the most sensitive and the most specific disk tests. PCR remains the gold standard for detection of AmpC beta-lactamases. This study represents the first report of CMY-2 variants of CMY-42 and CMY-102 beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis isolates in Egypt.
TI  - Structure of the RNA polymerase assembly factor Crl and identification of its interaction surface with sigma S.
AB  - Bacteria utilize multiple sigma factors that associate with core RNA polymerase (RNAP) to control transcription in response to changes in environmental conditions. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, Crl positively regulates the sigma(S) regulon by binding to sigma(S) to promote its association with core RNAP. We recently characterized the determinants in sigma(S) responsible for specific binding to Crl. However, little is known about the determinants in Crl required for this interaction. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of a Crl homolog from Proteus mirabilis in conjunction with in vivo and in vitro approaches that probe the Crl-sigma(S) interaction in E. coli. We show that the P. mirabilis, Vibrio harveyi, and E. coli Crl homologs function similarly in E. coli, indicating that Crl structure and function are likely conserved throughout gammaproteobacteria. We utilize phylogenetic conservation and bacterial two-hybrid analyses to predict residues in Crl important for the interaction with sigma(S). The results of p-benzoylphenylalanine (BPA)-mediated UV cross-linking studies further support the model in which an evolutionarily conserved central cleft is the surface on Crl that binds to sigma(S). Within this conserved binding surface, we identify a key residue in Crl that is critical for activation of Esigma(S)-dependent transcription in vivo and in vitro. Our study provides a physical basis for understanding the sigma(S)-Crl interaction.
TI  - Characterization of Proteus vulgaris K80 lipase immobilized on amine-terminated magnetic microparticles.
AB  - Proteus vulgaris K80 lipase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and immobilized on amine-terminated magnetic microparticles (Mag-MPs). The immobilization yield and activity retention were 84.15% and 7.87%, respectively. A homology model of lipase K80 was constructed using P. mirabilis lipase as the template. Many lysine residues were located on the protein surface, remote from active sites. The biochemical characteristics of immobilized lipase K80 were compared with the soluble free form of lipase K80. The optimum temperature of K80-Mag-MPs was 60 degrees C, which was 20 degrees C higher than that of the soluble form. K80-Mag-MPs also tended to be more stable than the soluble form at elevated temperatures and a broad range of pH. K80-Mag-MP maintained its stable form at up to 40 degrees C and in a pH range of 5.0- 10.0, whereas soluble K80 maintained its activity up to 35 degrees C and pH 6.0-10.0. K80-Mag-MPs had broader substrate specificity compared with that of soluble K80. K80-Mag-MPs showed about 80% residual relative activity after five recovery trials. These results indicate the potential benefit of K80-Mag-MPs as a biocatalyst in various industries.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in China: SMART China 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends program monitors the activity of antibiotics against aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) from intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in patients worldwide. METHODS: In 2011, 1 929 aerobic and facultative GNBs from 21 hospitals in 16 cities in China were collected. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility was determined following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Among the Gram-negative pathogens causing IAIs, Escherichia coli (47.3%) was the most commonly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (8.3%). Enterobacteriaceae comprised 78.8% (1521/1929) of the total isolates. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, ertapenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 95.1% and 94.4%, followed by amikacin (93.9%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (87.7%). Susceptibility rates of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae were 38.3%, 38.3%, 61.1%, and 50.8%, respectively. The leastactive agent against Enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (25.9%). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis were 68.8%, 38.1%, 41.2%, and 57.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs, and the most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin. Including the carbapenems, most agents exhibited reduced susceptibility against ESBL-positive and multidrug-resistant isolates.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its antibacterial susceptibility pattern among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at kanpur, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in pregnant  women. Pregnancy enhances the progression from ASB to symptomatic bacteriuria, which if left untreated, could lead to acute pyelonephritis and other adverse outcomes such as prematurity, postpartum, hypertensive disease, anaemia, UTIs and higher foetal mortality rates. AIM: To identify the prevalence of ASB, the most common causative microorganisms and the antibacterial susceptibilities of the isolated microorganisms at a tertiary care centre at Kanpur, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 300 asymptomatic pregnant women were screened for ASB by urine culture by using a semi quantitative culture method. RESULTS: In this study, significant bacteriuria was found in only 22 cases (7.3%). Growth of contaminants was seen in 40 cases (13.3%). Among cases which showed positive cultures, 48.9% were primigravidae and 51.1% were multigravidae. Highest incidence was reported in age group of 21-30 years. The predominant organisms which were isolated were Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Escherichia coli, the most common isolate, was found to be only 61% and 70% sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate, respectively. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 95%, and sensitivity to amikacin was 99%. Hundred percent sensitivity was found for the broad spectrum pencillins, imipenem, and meropenem. Klebsiella pneumoniae, the second most frequent organism which was grown on culture, was only 11% sensitive to ampicillin, while sensitivity to amoxicillin + clavulanate and cefuroxime was 86%. 100% sensitivity was found for cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSION: Routine urine culture test should be carried out for all antenatal women, to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria, and every positive case should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, to prevent any obstetric complication which is associated with pregnancy.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in Vietnam: report from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART 2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. Limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from Vietnam. This study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in Vietnam during 2009-2011. A total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends. Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. Among the species collected, Escherichia coli (48.1% ESBL-positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% ESBL-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. Ertapenem MIC90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/mL and remained unchanged for ESBL-positive isolates. Imipenem MIC90 values were also the same for all isolates and ESBL-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/mL, respectively. Ertapenem MIC90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/mL, respectively. Analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that CTX-M variants, particularly CTX-M-27 and CTX-M-15, were the predominant enzymes. High resistance rates in Vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout Asia and globally.
TI  - New mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes based on the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate and bioactive nitrogen-donor ligands. Synthesis, structure and biological properties.
AB  - Starting from the precursor [Zinc Valproate complex] (1), new mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes of valproic acid and nitrogen-based ligands, formulating as, [Zn(valp)22,9-dmphen] (2), [Zn2(valp)4(quin)2] (3), [Zn(valp)2(2-ampy)2] (4), and [Zn(valp)2(2-ampic)2] (5) (valp = valproate, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, quin = quinoline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, 2-ampic = 2-amino-6-picoline) were synthesized and characterized using IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR and UV-Vis spectrometry. The crystal structures of complexes 2, 3 and 4 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The complexes were also evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity using in-vitro agar diffusion method against three Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) species. Complex 2 showed considerable activity against all tested microorganisms and the effect of complexation on the anti-bacterial activity of the parent ligand of 2 was also investigated. The anti-bacterial activity of 2,9-dmphen against Gram-negative bacteria was enhanced upon complexation with zinc valproate. On the other hand, complexes 1 and 3 showed weak inhibition activity against the tested species and complexes 4 and 5 didn't show any activity at all. Two methods were used for testing the inhibition of ferriprotoporphyrinIX bio-mineralization: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment which considered being the target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodiaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 2 in preventing the formation of beta-Hematin was 80%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 91%.
TI  - A survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (BHR) IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern China. METHODS: A multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids was developed and used to determine these BHR plasmids. The difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and non-MDRO were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS: The average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for IncN, IncP, IncQ, IncW, and IncA/C in descending order. The distribution of all five BHR plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. The prevalence rates of all five BHR plasmids in MDROs were significantly higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). CONCLUSIONS: BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. The prevalence rates in MDRO are higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for NFGNB.
TI  - Antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five Gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. METHODS: The correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. RESULTS: Among these five bacteria, overall E. coli and K. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, P. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. In contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis differed in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. K. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in P. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. P. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas A. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. CONCLUSION: The development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - Crystal structure of the dithiol oxidase DsbA enzyme from proteus mirabilis bound non-covalently to an active site peptide ligand.
AB  - The disulfide bond forming DsbA enzymes and their DsbB interaction partners are attractive targets for development of antivirulence drugs because both are essential for virulence factor assembly in Gram-negative pathogens. Here we characterize PmDsbA from Proteus mirabilis, a bacterial pathogen increasingly associated with multidrug resistance. PmDsbA exhibits the characteristic properties of a DsbA, including an oxidizing potential, destabilizing disulfide, acidic active site cysteine, and dithiol oxidase catalytic activity. We evaluated a peptide, PWATCDS, derived from the partner protein DsbB and showed by thermal shift and isothermal titration calorimetry that it binds to PmDsbA. The crystal structures of PmDsbA, and the active site variant PmDsbAC30S were determined to high resolution. Analysis of these structures allows categorization of PmDsbA into the DsbA class exemplified by the archetypal Escherichia coli DsbA enzyme. We also present a crystal structure of PmDsbAC30S in complex with the peptide PWATCDS. The structure shows that the peptide binds non-covalently to the active site CXXC motif, the cis-Pro loop, and the hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site of the enzyme. This high-resolution structural data provides a critical advance for future structure-based design of non-covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors. Such inhibitors would represent an entirely new antibacterial class that work by switching off the DSB virulence assembly machinery.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in North America 2010-2011.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. This report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in North America in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) identified in ESBL-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. The incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. Characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(AmpC), and bla(KPC) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.
TI  - Characterization of 17 chaperone-usher fimbriae encoded by Proteus mirabilis reveals strong conservation.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative enteric bacterium that causes complicated urinary tract infections, particularly in patients with indwelling catheters. Sequencing of clinical isolate P. mirabilis HI4320 revealed the presence of 17 predicted chaperone-usher fimbrial operons. We classified these fimbriae into three groups by their genetic relationship to other chaperone-usher fimbriae. Sixteen of these fimbriae are encoded by all seven currently sequenced P. mirabilis genomes. The predicted protein sequence of the major structural subunit for 14 of these fimbriae was highly conserved (>/= 95% identity), whereas three other structural subunits (Fim3A, UcaA and Fim6A) were variable. Further examination of 58 clinical isolates showed that 14 of the 17 predicted major structural subunit genes of the fimbriae were present in most strains (>85%). Transcription of the predicted major structural subunit genes for all 17 fimbriae was measured under different culture conditions designed to mimic conditions in the urinary tract. The majority of the fimbrial genes were induced during stationary phase, static culture or colony growth when compared to exponential-phase aerated culture. Major structural subunit proteins for six of these fimbriae were detected using MS of proteins sheared from the surface of broth-cultured P. mirabilis, demonstrating that this organism may produce multiple fimbriae within a single culture. The high degree of conservation of P. mirabilis fimbriae stands in contrast to uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, which exhibit greater variability in their fimbrial repertoires. These findings suggest there may be evolutionary pressure for P. mirabilis to maintain a large fimbrial arsenal.
TI  - In vitro studies of epithelium-associated crystallization caused by uropathogens  during urinary calculi development.
AB  - Infectious urinary stones account for about 10% of all urinary stones. In 50% of  cases urolithiasis is a recurrent illness, which can lead to the loss of a kidney if not properly treated. One of the reasons for recurrence of the disease may be the ability of bacteria to invade urothelial cells, persist in the host cells and serve as potential reservoirs for infection. Various uropathogens are associated with the formation of bacteria-induced urinary stones but Proteus mirabilis is the most commonly isolated (70%). An in vitro model was used in this study to analyze intracellular growth and crystallization in the presence of P. mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Human ureter (Hu 609) and bladder (HCV 29) epithelial cell lines were infected with bacteria and incubated (3-72 h) in the presence of synthetic urine and amikacin to prevent extracellular bacterial growth. During the incubation the number of bacteria (CFU/ml) inside epithelial cells and the intensity of crystallization were established. Crystallization was determined as an amount of a calcium radioisotope. The chosen strains of uropathogens were able to invade both types of epithelial cells but the Hu 609 cells were invaded to a higher extent. However, crystallization occurred only in the presence of P. mirabilis strains which were invasive and urease-positive. The highest intensity of cell-associated crystallization was observed when the number of bacteria within the urothelium remained stable during the time of incubation. These results show that P. mirabilis has an ability to form crystals inside the host cells. Under these conditions bacteria are protected from antibiotic killing, which leads to persistent and recurrent infections. We also suspect that this phenomenon may be an important stage of kidney stones formation.
TI  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic Gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in European and United States hospitals (2012).
AB  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (IAI), complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing IAI and healthcare-associated UTI (HCA-UTI). The organisms were consecutively collected from January to December 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the United States (USA) and 15 European countries by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS). The collection included 809 organisms from IAI and 2474 organisms from HCA-UTI, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M07-A9 document. Overall, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against E. coli (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an MIC of </=8 mg/L) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (MDR; MIC50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/L) and ESBL-phenotype strains (MIC50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/L). Ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most K. pneumoniae strains (MIC50/90, 0.25/16 mg/L, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an MIC of </=8 mg/L), but some ESBL-phenotype (MIC50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/L) and MDR (MIC50/90, 16/>32 mg/L) isolates exhibited elevated MIC values. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mg/L; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/L) and retained potency against many MDR (MIC50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/L), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (MIC50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/L) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC50/90, 2/>32 mg/L) strains. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/L), Enterobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/L), Citrobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/L), Proteus mirabilis (MIC50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/L), indole-positive Proteae (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/L), and Serratia spp. (MIC50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/L). In summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic Gram-negative pathogens causing IAI and HCA-UTI in USA and European medical centers.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Towards a receptor-free immobilization and SERS detection of urinary tract infections causative pathogens.
AB  - Based on molecular-specific surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy we were able to discriminate between rough and smooth strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis bacteria. For this purpose, bacteria have been immobilized through electrostatic forces by inducing a positive charge on the glass slide. This way, SERS spectra on bacterial biomass and also on single bacteria could be recorded in less than 2 h, by using concentrated silver nanoparticles as SERS-active substrate. Single-bacterium SERS spectral fingerprints showed to be sensitive to the presence of the O-antigen at strain level and to the microorganisms growth phase. By using principal component analysis (PCA) on the SERS spectra recorded from E. coli and P. mirabilis, these two uropathogens could be fairly discriminated.
TI  - Antibacterial Activities and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory (Membrane Stability) Properties of Methanolic Extracts of Gardenia coronaria Leaves.
AB  - This work is carried out with Gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family Rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. Leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. The leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. Methanol extract from the leaves of Gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. The lower concentrations of Methanolic leaf extract of Gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with Kanamycin. The crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of Aspirin as positive control. The Methanolic extracts of Gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Shigella sonnei, Shigella boydii, and Proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. The extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
TI  - Microbiota and anthropic interference on antimicrobial resistance profile of bacteria isolated from Brazilian Maned-wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus).
AB  - Both the study of Brazilian wild mammal fauna and the conditions that foster the  preservation of endangered species, such as Brazilian Maned-wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), in wild life are of extreme importance. In order to study the resistance profile of microbiota bacterial colonizing Brazilian Maned-wolf, this work investigated samples from eight male captive and free roaming animals originating from different Brazilian geographical regions. Samples for microbiological purposes were collected with swabs and kept in appropriate transport medium. Using routine microbiological techniques, the isolated bacteria were tested toward antimicrobial drugs by the agar disk diffusion method. Results showed that all samples from wild animals were sensitive toward all drugs tested. Conversely, the resistance profile of bacteria isolated from captive animals varied among strains and animal body site location. Escherichia coli samples from prepuce, anus and ear showed multi-resistance toward at least four drugs, especially against erythromycin and tetracycline, followed by Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris strains isolated from anus and ear. Among Gram-positive bacteria, strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci showed multi-resistance mainly toward erythromycin and amoxicillin. The work discusses these findings and suggests that profile of multi-resistance bacteria from captive subjects may be attributed to direct contact with human or through lifestyle factors such as feeding, predation or contact of animals with urban animals such as birds, rodents, and insects from surrounding environments.
TI  - A comparison of inpatient versus outpatient resistance patterns of pediatric urinary tract infection.
AB  - PURPOSE: Prior single center studies showed that antibiotic resistance patterns differ between outpatients and inpatients. We compared antibiotic resistance patterns for urinary tract infection between outpatients and inpatients on a national level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined outpatient and inpatient urinary isolates from children younger than 18 years using The Surveillance Network (Eurofins Scientific, Luxembourg, Luxembourg), a database of antibiotic susceptibility results, as well as patient demographic data from 195 American hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of the 6 most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We compared differences in uropathogen prevalence and resistance patterns for outpatient and inpatient isolates using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: We identified 25,418 outpatient (86% female) and 5,560 inpatient (63% female) urinary isolates. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen overall but its prevalence varied by gender and visit setting, that is 79% of uropathogens overall for outpatient isolates, including 83% of females and 50% of males, compared to 54% for overall inpatient isolates, including 64% of females and 37% of males (p <0.001). Uropathogen resistance to many antibiotics was lower in the outpatient vs inpatient setting, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 24% vs 30% and cephalothin 16% vs 22% for E. coli (each p <0.001), cephalothin 7% vs 14% for Klebsiella (p = 0.03), ceftriaxone 12% vs 24% and ceftazidime 15% vs 33% for Enterobacter (each p <0.001), and ampicillin 3% vs 13% and ciprofloxacin 5% vs 12% for Enterococcus (each p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Uropathogen resistance rates of several antibiotics are higher for urinary specimens obtained from inpatients vs outpatients. Separate outpatient vs inpatient based antibiograms can aid in empirical prescribing for pediatric urinary tract infections.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - Mycosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles and their activity against some human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to biosynthesis silver nanoparticles from the fungus Nigrospora sphaerica isolated from soil samples and to examine their activity against five human pathogenic strains of bacteria viz. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion method. The synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with commonly used antibiotic Gentamycin against the selected bacteria was also examined. The synthesized silver nanoparticles from free-cell filtrate were characterized by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis showed a peak at 420 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, FTIR analysis verified the detection of protein capping of silver nanoparticles while SEM micrographs revealed that the silver nanoparticles are dispersed and aggregated and mostly having spherical shape within the size range between 20 and 70 nm. The synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited a varied growth inhibition activity (15-26 mm diam inhibition zones) against the tested pathogenic bacteria. A remarkable increase of bacterial growth inhibition (26-34 mm diam) was detected when a combination of silver nanoparticles and Gentamycin was used. A significant increase in fold area of antibacterial activity was observed when AgNPs in combination with Gentamycin was applied. The synthesized silver nanoparticles produced by the fungus N. sphaerica is a promising to be used as safe drug in medical therapy due to their broad spectrum against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae in a Saudi Arabian tertiary hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis). In addition, different methods for detection of these enzymes, including the newly introduced CHROMagar ESBL, were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: A total of 382 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were obtained from King Fahad Specialist Hospital - Dammam, during 2011 and screened for production of ESBL using advanced expert system of Vitek 2, CHROMagar and ESBL-E-strips. PCR assay was used to detect blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M genes. Susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics was determined. RESULTS: The overall proportion of ESBL-producing enterobacterial isolates was 30.6%, which was higher in E. coli (35.8%) than in K. pneumoniae (25.7%). ESBL genotypes showed remarkable increase in the CTX-M (97.4%) compared to SHV (23.1%). The predominant ESBL was CTX-M- 15 (92.1 %). No TEM ESBL was detected in this study. The Vitek2 showed the highest sensitivity (100%), and the CHROMagar had the lowest specificity (97.3%) compared to the molecular method. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high level of blaCTX-M positive ESBL isolates are circulating in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The trend of a multidrug-resistant profile associated with the recovery of the blaCTX-M gene is alarming.
TI  - Activity of ceftaroline-avibactam tested against contemporary Enterobacteriaceae  isolates carrying beta-lactamases prevalent in the United States.
AB  - Contemporary (2012) beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n=493) from U.S. hospitals were tested against ceftaroline-avibactam. Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis isolates displaying the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) screening criteria for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were evaluated. Isolates carried genes encoding CTX-M (n=316, CTX-M-14-like and -15-like), KPC (n=45), CMY-2-like (n=54), or SHV enzyme with ESBL activity (n=78). Ceftaroline-avibactam inhibited 98.2% of the isolates at </=0.5 mug/mL, and all strains were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL of this novel beta-lactamase-inhibitor combination. These results confirm that ceftaroline-avibactam could be a useful therapeutic option for Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing beta-lactamases that are prevalent in the United States.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact  of patient risk factors on susceptibility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from January 1 to December 31, 2012. A urinary antibiogram specific for Escherichia coli (EC), Proteus mirabilis (PM), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was developed. Urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities were compared. Urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for </=30 days, hospitalization for </=30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: There were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. Overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (KP, 14% vs 7% [P = .001]; EC, 13% vs 9% [P < .001]; PM, 18% vs 10% [P = .004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. Health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for EC and PM. CONCLUSIONS: Using a syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.
TI  - blaKPC gene Detection in Clinical Isolates of Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, especially in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, is an emerging problem worldwide. A common mechanism of carbapenem resistance is the production of class-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The present study focused on determining the antibiotic resistance pattern and prevalence of bla KPC gene coding for KPC in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. METHODOLOGY: Forty six carbapenem resistant isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested for antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Modified Hodge Test (MHT) and PCR for bla KPC gene detection were performed on these isolates. Of these, 22 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 21 were Escherichia coli, 2 were Citrobacter species and 1 was Proteus mirabilis Results: Forty three (93.4%) out of the 46 isolates were resistant to Meropenem, 34 (73.9%) were resistant to Imipenem and 30 (65.2%) were resistant to both Imipenem and Meropenem. Modified Hodge Test was positive in 38 (82.6%) out of 46 isolates and blaKPC gene was detected in 31 (67.4%) isolates. bla KPC gene was detected in 28 out of the 38 MHT positive isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the CANWARD study, 2011-2012.
AB  - Plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. The in vitro activities of plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between January 2011 and October 2012. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method, with MICs interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints, when available. Plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with all species except Proteus mirabilis having an MIC90 of </=1 mug/ml. Plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible Escherichia coli, with MIC50 and MIC90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. Furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an MIC of </=1 mug/ml. The MIC50 and MIC90 values for plazomicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. Plazomicin had an MIC50 of 8 mug/ml and an MIC90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. Plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with both having MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. In summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. These data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.
TI  - Therapeutic challenges of ESBLS and AmpC beta-lactamase producers in a tertiary care center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to broad-spectrum beta lactams mediated by extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta lactamases (AmpC betaLs) enzymes is an increasing problem worldwide. Determination of their prevalence is essential to formulate an effective antibiotic policy and hospital infection control measures. Present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ESBL and AmpC betaL producers in ICU of a tertiary care center. METHODS: A total of 262 clinical isolates comprising of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis that were recovered from various clinical specimens over a one year period, were studied. Antibiogram profile was determined to conventionally used antibiotics, along with recommended tests for detection of ESBL and AmpC betaL production. RESULTS: 40.07% (105/262) were found to be ESBL producers, 14.8% (39/262) were AmpC bL producers. The coexistence of ESBL and AmpC betaL producers was detected in 9.9% (26/262) of the isolates. CONCLUSION: Screening of multidrug resistant bacteria especially belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae poses considerable therapeutic challenges in critical care patients because of the production of ESBL and AmpC betaL. Strategies to keep a check on the emergence of such drug resistant microbes by hospital environmental surveillance and laboratory monitoring should form an important aspect of Hospital Infection control policy guidelines.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - The need for culture swabs in laparoscopically treated appendicitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Appendicitis remains the most common cause of an acute abdomen. Obtaining intra-abdominal cultures is routine surgical practice. There are studies showing no efficacy of such procedures in cases where open appendectomies are performed. AIM: The goal of this study was to assess the need for obtaining intra-abdominal cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012, 369 patients were operated on with the diagnosis of histopathologically proven acute appendicitis. Sixty-two percent of them were operated on using laparoscopic techniques. The microbiological assessment was routinely done for the open procedures and in 42% of cases that underwent a laparoscopic operation. RESULTS: In 57% (134) the swabbing results were negative. Among 43% (102) of the patients with a positive result, Escherichia coli was isolated in 76.5% (78), Proteus mirabilis in 13.7% (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 4.9% (5) and Citrobacter freundii in 4.9% (5). Five cases had bacteria resistant to the antibiotic given preoperatively (that is 4.9% of all positive cultures and 1.4% of all operated patients). However, these cases did not affect the incidence of postoperative complications. Consideration of the postoperative morbidity showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the laparoscopic group with and without intra-operative swabbing (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative patient outcome was more dependent on the pathology of the appendix than on the results of the microbiological assessment at the time of surgery. Hence, routine intra-operative cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies appear to have little value in patient management. Swabbing during laparoscopic procedures should be limited to only selected high-risk groups.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of isolates from paediatric intensive care units in Zagreb.
AB  - AIM: Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. Results of the six years period (2002-2007) for the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents against Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates collected at pediatric intensive care units of the University Hospital Center Zagreb in Croatia were reported. METHODS: A total of 110 Gram-negative and 43 Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric specimens were tested. The minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI. RESULTS: There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and gentamicin (50%) are a raising concern. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant Gram-negative species with two (12%) of the strains resistant to meropenem, three (18%) to imipenem, 10 (47%) to gentamicin and six (35%) to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria in pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that meropenem has excellent potency and spectrum of activity despite being prescribed for a long time for the treatment of seriously ill patients, and still appears to be a reliable option for the initial empirical therapy of serious nosocomial infections in children. However, later studies have shown the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria after 2008.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in United States and European hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by Gram-negative organisms. Rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the ICU can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in ICUs (ICU patients). The isolates were consecutively collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from January 2009 to December 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from ICU patients (3445 from the United States [USA] and 2544 from Europe [EU]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-ICU patients (9271 from USA and 7973 from EU). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from ICU patients, followed by Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility rates were generally lower among ICU isolates compared to non-ICU organisms. E. coli isolates from ICU patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates (13.7% in USA and 16.6% in EU); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/mL), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against Klebsiella spp. ESBL-phenotype rates have increased among both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. from ICU patients in the USA and in Europe, with the most noticeable increase among Klebsiella spp. from Europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; P = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). Meropenem susceptibility among Klebsiella spp. improved slightly in the USA but decreased markedly in Europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. Only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in USA and 84.9% in EU) exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa strains from ICU patients. The greatest differences in susceptibility rates between P. aeruginosa strains from ICU and non-ICU patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The results of this study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for USA and EU ICU patient isolates.
TI  - Recommendations for the empirical treatment of complicated urinary tract infections using surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complicated urinary tract infections (c-UTIs) are among the most common nosocomial infections and a substantial part of the antimicrobial agents used in hospitals is for the treatment of c-UTIs. Data from surveillance can be used to guide the empirical treatment choices of clinicians when treating c-UTIs. We therefore used nation-wide surveillance data to evaluate antimicrobial coverage of agents for the treatment of c-UTI in the Netherlands. METHODS: We included the first isolate per patient of urine samples of hospitalised patients collected by the Infectious Disease Surveillance Information System for Antibiotic Resistance (ISIS-AR) in 2012, and determined the probability of inadequate coverage for antimicrobial agents based on species distribution and susceptibility. Analyses were repeated for various patient groups and hospital settings. RESULTS: The most prevalent bacteria in 27,922 isolates of 23,357 patients were Escherichia coli (47%), Enterococcus spp. (14%), Proteus mirabilis (8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). For all species combined, the probability of inadequate coverage was <5% for amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combined with gentamicin and the carbapenems. When including gram-negative bacteria only, the probability of inadequate coverage was 4.0%, 2.7%, 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively, for amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a second or a third generation cephalosporin in combination with gentamicin, and the carbapenems (0.4%). There were only small variations in results among different patient groups and hospital settings. CONCLUSIONS: When excluding Enterococcus spp., considered as less virulent, and the carbapenems, considered as last-resort drugs, empirical treatment for c-UTI with the best chance of adequate coverage are one of the studied beta-lactam-gentamicin combinations. This study demonstrates the applicability of routine surveillance data for up-to-date clinical practice guidelines on empirical antimicrobial therapy, essential in patient care given the evolving bacterial susceptibility.
TI  - [One-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for MRSA isolated in eight medical facilities in Kumamoto prefecture].
AB  - To investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except MRSA) in Kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-Escherichia coli, ESBL-Klebsiella species, ESBL-Proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant Enterococcii in eight general hospitals from May in 2009 to April in 2010. ESBL-E. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa came second. The isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase, while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant P. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals. However, the isolation numbers of ESBL-Klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. Furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.
TI  - Evaluation of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute phenotypic confirmatory test to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from 4005 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis isolates.
AB  - A subset of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends that were positive for the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypic confirmatory test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem MIC of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for ESBL genes. Most ESBL phenotype E. coli or K. pneumoniae possessed an ESBL gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were removed. This rate was lower for P. mirabilis (73.4 %) and K. oxytoca (62.5 %). Virtually all ESBL-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [CLSI or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints)]. Fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (CLSI breakpoints). In addition, 21.1 % of E. coli, 25 % of K. oxytoca and 78.7 % of P. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but ESBL positive. This suggests that CLSI breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect ESBLs. The lower EUCAST breakpoints detected ESBLs in E. coli and K. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of ESBL-positive isolates of P. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. For isolates with ertapenem MICs >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate ESBL phenotype analysis was observed for E. coli and K. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). If carbapenemase-positive K. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. The positive predictive values for the ESBL phenotypic test with E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively. We therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic ESBL-positive P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca with molecular analysis.
TI  - Urinary tract infection among obstetric fistula patients at Gondar University Hospital, northwest Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. In developing countries particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where access to emergency obstetrical care is often limited, obstetric fistula usually occurs as a result of prolonged obstructed labour. Obstetric fistula patients have many social and health related problems like urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this reality there was limited data on prevalence UTIs on those patients in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, drug susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors of UTI among obstetric fistula patients at Gondar University Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from January to May, 2013 at Gondar University Hospital. From each post repair obstetric fistula patients, socio-demographic and UTIs associated risk factors were collected by using a structured questionnaire. After the removal of their catheters, the mid-stream urine was collected and cultured on CLED. After overnight incubation, significant bacteriuria was sub-cultured on Blood Agar Plate (BAP) and MacConkey (MAC). The bacterial species were identified by series of biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility test was done by disc diffusion method. Data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: A total of 53 post repair obstetric fistula patients were included for the determination of bacterial isolate and 28 (52.8%) of them had significant bacteriuria. Majority of the bacterial isolates, 26 (92.9%), were gram negative bacteria and the predominant ones were Citrobacter 13 (24.5%) and E. coli 6 (11.3%). Enterobacter, E.coli and Proteus mirabilis were 100% resistant to tetracycline. Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsella pneumonia, Klebsella ozenae and Staphylococcus aureus were also 100% resistant to ceftriaxone. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of bacterial isolates in obstetric fistula patients was high and majority of the isolates were gram negative bacteria. Even thought the predominant bacterial isolates were Citrobacter and E. coli, all of the bacterial isolates had multiple antibiotic resistance patterns which alert health profession to look better treatment for these patients.
TI  - Diafiltration MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry method for culture-independent detection and identification of pathogens directly from urine specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the aim of rapid, culture-independent identification of microorganisms directly from urine specimens, we developed a diafiltration matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method. METHODS: In this procedure, urine specimens are desalted, fractionated, and concentrated prior to MS analysis. The analytic performance characteristics of the diafiltration method were assessed in a prospective trial whereby 100 fresh urine specimens were processed using diafiltration MALDI-TOF MS. Concomitant with this, conventional culture was performed with results blinded to the MS operator. RESULTS: The diafiltration method correctly identified urine specimens positive for uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) and correctly classified all specimens negative for clinically relevant bacteriuria, including a subset of contaminated urine specimens and a subset with growth of clinically insignificant flora. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 67% and 100%, respectively. The detection limit of this method was 10(5) to 10(6) colony-forming units/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Using the diafiltration method, we were able to improve the turnaround time for microorganism identification from 24 to 48 hours (for conventional culture) to 2 to 3 hours. Although methodological refinements are under way to further improve the clinical sensitivity and turnaround time, the 100% positive predictive value of this method suggests that it could be used to guide the selection of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of factors affecting mortality in Fournier's Gangrene: Retrospective clinical study of sixteen cases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fournier's gangrene is a progressive, necrotizing fasciitis due to synergistic infection of the perineum and external genitalia that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study is to review the diagnostic and treatment methods that effect mortality in Fournier's gangrene. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen patients who were diagnosed and treated at our clinic between 2011 and 2013 due to Fournier's gangrene were retrospectively analyzed. The surviving and non-surviving patient groups were compared in terms of age, sex, onset time of symptoms, isolated microorganisms, concomitant diseases, Fournier's gangrene severity index (FGSI), and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Ten of our cases (62.5%) were male and six (37.5%) were female, with a mean age of 61.2+/-12.3 (42-73) years. The mortality rate was 18.8% (3 cases). The mean duration of symptoms before admission was 4.31+/-1.81 (2-8) days. This period was 6.67+/-1.52 days in patients who succumbed to death, and 3.77+/-1.42 days in patients who survived (p=0.007). Ten cases (62.5%) had concomitant diabetes mellitus. The most common organism isolated in wound cultures was Escherichia coli (68.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. in the remaining patients. The mean FGSI of surviving patients was 3.84+/-1.77, and 7.66+/-0.57 in fatal cases (p=0.003). The mean length of hospital stay was 25.5 days (2-57) and duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in survivors (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The delay in diagnosis and higher FGSI may be responsible for worsening of prognosis and mortality in Fournier's gangrene. Early diagnosis and determination of the severity of the disease, aggressive surgical debridement and appropriate antimicrobial therapy may improve prognosis.
TI  - Automated versus manual sample inoculations in routine clinical microbiology: a performance evaluation of the fully automated InoqulA instrument.
AB  - The process of plate streaking has been automated to improve the culture readings, isolation quality, and workflow of microbiology laboratories. However, instruments have not been well evaluated under routine conditions. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the fully automated InoqulA instrument (BD Kiestra B.V., The Netherlands) in the automated seeding of liquid specimens and samples collected using swabs with transport medium. We compared manual and automated methods according to the (i) within-run reproducibility using Escherichia coli-calibrated suspensions, (ii) intersample contamination using a series of alternating sterile broths and broths with >10(5) CFU/ml of either E. coli or Proteus mirabilis, (iii) isolation quality with standardized mixed bacterial suspensions of diverse complexity and a 4-category standardized scale (very poor, poor, fair to good, or excellent), and (iv) agreement of the results obtained from 244 clinical specimens. By involving 15 technicians in the latter part of the comparative study, we estimated the variability in the culture quality at the level of the laboratory team. The instrument produced satisfactory reproducibility with no sample cross-contamination, and it performed better than the manual method, with more colony types recovered and isolated (up to 11% and 17%, respectively). Finally, we showed that the instrument did not shorten the seeding time over short periods of work compared to that for the manual method. Altogether, the instrument improved the quality and standardization of the isolation, thereby contributing to a better overall workflow, shortened the time to results, and provided more accurate results for polymicrobial specimens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of uropathogens from pregnant women with urinary tract infection in Abakaliki, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection during  pregnancy and a significant cause of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The causative bacteria have remained virtually the same although with variations in individual prevalence. There has been an increasing resistance by these bacteria to the commonly available antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of UTI, the common causative bacteria, and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among pregnant women with UTI. METHODOLOGY: This is a descriptive study that was carried out at the Obstetrics Department of two tertiary institutions in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria (Federal Medical Center and Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital) over a period of 12 months. Midstream urine specimens from selected pregnant women with clinical features of UTI were collected for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity. The results were analyzed with the 2008 Epi Info software. RESULTS: A total of 542 pregnant women presented with symptoms of UTI and were recruited for the study over the study period. Of the 542 pregnant women, 252 (46.5%) had significant bacteriuria with positive urine culture and varying antibiotic sensitivity pattern. The prevalence of symptomatic UTI was 3%. Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria isolated with a percentage of 50.8%. Other isolated micro organisms included Stapylococcus aereus (52 cultures, 20.6%), Proteus mirabilis (24 cultures, 9.5%), S. saprophyticus (18 cultures, 7.1%), Streptococcus spp. (14 cultures, 5.6%), Citrobacter spp. (5 cultures, 2.0%), Klebsiella spp. (4 cultures, 1.6%), Enterobacter spp. (4 cultures, 1.6%), and Pseudomonas spp. (3 cultures, 1.2%). Levofloxacin had the highest overall antibiotic sensitivity of 92.5%. Others with overall antibiotic sensitivity pattern greater than 50% included cefpodoxime (87.3%), ofloxacin (77.4%), ciprofloxacin (66.7%), ceftriaxone (66.7%), and gentamicin (50.8%). CONCLUSION: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in pregnancy with Enterococcus (Staphylococcus) gaining prominence. Cephalosporin and quinolones were shown to be very effective against the organisms causing UTI in these pregnant women.
TI  - Inactivation of Gram-Negative Bacteria by Low-Pressure RF Remote Plasma Excited in N2-O2 Mixture and SF6 Gases.
AB  - The role of low-pressure RF plasma in the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157,  Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter sakazakii using N2-O2 and SF6 gases was assessed. 1x10(9) colony-forming units (CFUs) of each bacterial isolate were placed on three polymer foils. The effects of pressure, power, distance from the source, and exposure time to plasma gases were optimized. The best conditions to inactivate the four bacteria were a 91%N2-9%O2 mixture and a 30-minute exposure time. SF6 gas was more efficient for all the tested isolates in as much as the treatment time was reduced to only three minutes. Therefore, low-pressure plasma could be used to sterilize heat and/or moisture-sensitive medical instruments.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of geranium oil against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  - Hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. They can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the risk of their emergence. Diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of geranium oil against Gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. Clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. The constituents of geranium oil were specified by GC-FID-MS analysis. The micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. The tested geranium oil was efficacious against Gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. The results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles green-synthesized  using pineapple leaf (Ananas comosus).
AB  - Pineapple leaf was used in this study for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles based on the search for sustainable synthetic means. Indeed, this offered an economical and sustainable synthetic route relative to expensive and toxic chemical methods. The leaf extract was used and the corresponding nanoparticles obtained were subjected to UV-vis analysis at different times. The UV-vis was used to monitor the silver nanoparticle formation through sampling at time intervals. The formation of silver nanoparticles was apparently displayed within 2 min with evidence of surface plasmon bands (SPB) between 440 and 460 nm. The crystals was equally characterized using FTIR, X-ray diffraction methods and TEM. The different results obtained suggested the appearance of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) as determined by the process parameters with a particle size of 12.4 nm. The sample was further screened against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli using Gentamicin as control. From the results, there is evidence of inhibition towards bacteria growth. It can now be inferred from the studies that biosynthesis of nanoparticles could be a gateway to our numerous health issues.
TI  - Inhibition of biofilm development of uropathogens by curcumin - an anti-quorum sensing agent from Curcuma longa.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is caused primarily by the quorum sensing (QS)-dependent  biofilm forming ability of uropathogens. In the present investigation, an anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) agent curcumin from Curcuma longa (turmeric) was shown to inhibit the biofilm formation of uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, possibly by interfering with their QS systems. The antibiofilm potential of curcumin on uropathogens as well as its efficacy in disturbing the mature biofilms was examined under light microscope and confocal laser scanning microscope. The treatment with curcumin was also found to attenuate the QS-dependent factors, such as exopolysaccharide production, alginate production, swimming and swarming motility of uropathogens. Furthermore, it was documented that curcumin enhanced the susceptibility of a marker strain and uropathogens to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - [Etiologic and antibiotic susceptibility profile of the first episode of febrile  urinary tract infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection in childhood; its diagnosis involves performing a urine culture. AIM: To describe the etiology and bacterial susceptibility of the first episode of UTI in children presenting with fever to the emergency room. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and five children (2 months -5 years old) seen at the Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio in Santiago, between November 2009 and November 2010 were evaluated. A urine specimen was obtained by transurethral catheterization. Urine was cultured and microorganisms were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: 76.2% (80) of patients were women and 80% (84) were under 18 months. Urine sediment was abnormal in 82.5%. The most frequently isolated microorganism was Escherichia coli (96.1%) showing high susceptibility to aminoglycosides (near 100%), third generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin; and low susceptibility to cephalothin (69%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%). We found one ESBL-producing strain. CONCLUSION: The most common uropathogen was E. coli with good in vitro susceptibility to aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins, which are the recommended initial empirical therapy. E. coli ESBL-producing strains appear as emerging pathogens in community acquired UTIs in children.
TI  - Contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae in the nine U.S. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
AB  - Escherichia coli (328 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (296), Klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and Proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine U.S. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. The highest ESBL rates were noted for K. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the Mid-Atlantic and West South Central census regions. CTX-M group 1 (including CTX-M-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the United States but was more prevalent in the West South Central, Mid-Atlantic, and East North Central regions. KPC producers (118 strains [112 K. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the Mid-Atlantic region (58 strains). Thirteen KPC producers also carried blaCTX-M. SHV genes encoding ESBL activity were detected among 176 isolates. Other beta-lactamase genes observed were CTX-M group 9 (72 isolates), FOX (10), TEM ESBL (9), DHA (7), CTX-M group 2 (3), NDM-1 (2 [Colorado]), and CTX-M groups 8 and 25 (1). Additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. KPC producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. Overall, meropenem (MIC50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (MIC50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. NDM-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. The diversity and increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from U.S. hospitals.
TI  - Risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections caused by plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae emerged worldwide. This study was conducted to determine the risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as community-onset UTIs caused by Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary-care teaching hospital from December 2010 to January 2012 were included. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were excluded. We identified plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. RESULTS: Among the 323 non-ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset UTIs, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for AmpC. Escherichia coli was the most common AmpC-producing organism (60%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). The independent risk factors for acquisition of AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae included prior history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (OR) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (OR = 4.049; 95% CI = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (OR = 9.683; 95% CI = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). AmpC-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. Carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. The most commonly identified plasmid-mediated AmpC gene was blaCIT, followed by blaDHA/blaEBC, and blaMOx. CONCLUSION: For community-onset UTIs, AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. To treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered.
TI  - Urinary concentrations and antibacterial activities of nitroxoline at 250 milligrams versus trimethoprim at 200 milligrams against uropathogens in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Because of the increasing bacterial resistance of uropathogens against standard antibiotics, such as trimethoprim (TMP), older antimicrobial drugs, such as nitroxoline (NTX), should be reevaluated. This randomized crossover study investigated the urinary concentrations of parent drugs and their metabolites and their antibacterial activities (urinary inhibitory titers [UITs] and urinary bactericidal titers [UBTs]) against uropathogens at three different urinary pH values within 24 h in six healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of NTX at 250 mg versus TMP at 200 mg. In three additional volunteers, urinary bactericidal kinetics (UBK) were studied after oral administration of NTX at 250 mg three times a day. The mean urinary concentrations of NTX and NTX sulfate in 24 h were 0.012 to 0.507 mg/liter and 0.28 to 27.83 mg/liter, respectively. The mean urinary concentrations of TMP were 18.79 to 41.59 mg/liter. The antibacterial activity of NTX was higher in acidic urine than in alkaline urine, and that of TMP was higher in alkaline urine than in acidic urine. The UITs and UBTs of NTX were generally lower than those of TMP except for a TMP-resistant Escherichia coli strain, for which NTX showed higher UITs/UBTs than did TMP. UBK showed mainly bacteriostatic activity of NTX in urine. NTX exhibits mainly bacteriostatic activity and TMP also shows bactericidal activity in urine against susceptible strains. NTX is a more active antibacterial in acidic urine, and TMP is more active in alkaline urine. The cumulative effects of multiple doses or inhibition of bacterial adherence could not be evaluated. (This study has been registered at EudraCT under registration no. 2009-015631-32.).
TI  - Fosfomycin trometamol: a review of its use as a single-dose oral treatment for patients with acute lower urinary tract infections and pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  - Fosfomycin trometamol (fosfomycin tromethamine) [Monuril((R)), Monurol((R)), Monural((R))] is approved in numerous countries worldwide, mainly for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Fosfomycin has good in vitro activity against common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli), Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and the susceptibility of uropathogens to fosfomycin has remained relatively stable over time. A single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol 3 g (the approved dosage) achieves high concentrations in urine. Results of recent randomized trials indicate that single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to 3- to 7-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin in women with uncomplicated lower UTIs. In addition, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar bacteriological efficacy to a 5-day course of cefuroxime axetil or a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, and similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to a 5-day course of cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or a 3-day course of ceftibuten in pregnant women with a lower UTI. Single-dose fosfomycin trometamol was generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea) reported most commonly. In conclusion, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol is an important option for the first-line empirical treatment of uncomplicated lower UTIs.
TI  - Bioconversion of l-glutamic acid to alpha-ketoglutaric acid by an immobilized whole-cell biocatalyst expressing l-amino acid deaminase from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The goal of this work was to develop an immobilized whole-cell biocatalytic process for the environment-friendly synthesis of alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG) from l-glutamic acid. We compared the suitability of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains overexpressing Proteus mirabilisl-amino acid deaminase (l-AAD) as potential biocatalysts. Although both recombinant strains were biocatalytically active, the performance of B. subtilis was superior to that of E. coli. With l-glutamic acid as the substrate, alpha-KG production levels by membranes isolated from B. subtilis and E. coli were 55.3+/-1.73 and 21.7+/-0.39mug/mg protein/min, respectively. The maximal conversion ratio of l-glutamic acid to alpha-KG was 31% (w/w) under the following optimal conditions: 15g/L l-glutamic acid, 20g/L whole-cell biocatalyst, 5mM MgCl2, 40 degrees C, pH 8.0, and 24-h incubation. Immobilization of whole cells with alginate increased the recyclability by an average of 23.33% per cycle. This work established an efficient one-step biotransformation process for the production of alpha-KG using immobilized whole B. subtilis overexpressing P. mirabilisl-AAD. Compared with traditional multistep chemical synthesis, the biocatalytic process described here has the advantage of reducing environmental pollution and thus has great potential for the large-scale production of alpha-KG.

TI  - Avibactam reverts the ceftazidime MIC90 of European Gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. The effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime MIC frequency distribution of Gram-negative European clinical isolates was observed and compared to European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) listed for ceftazidime. METHODS: Ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam MICs were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference broth microdilution methods for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in Europe during 2009. RESULTS: The MIC(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against P. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 European surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. That is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for P. aeruginosa to the ECOFF. Similarly, the MIC(90) values for ceftazidime against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and P. mirabilis were also reduced to the ECOFF by the presence of avibactam. Avibactam reduced the ceftazidime MIC(90) value against collected Enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). No ECOFF has been defined for Enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for Gram-negative bacteria to the ECOFF.
TI  - Autocatalytic growth of biofunctionalized antibacterial silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Development of eco-friendly processes for nanosynthesis is gaining importance owing to the widespread application of nanoparticles (NPs). In the present study, we have explained the mechanism and kinetics of bioreduction in the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Rhizophora apiculata. Spectrophotometric methods were employed to quantify the bioactive molecules present before and after the reduction process. The results showed that the polyphenols were the main components responsible for the biosynthesis of AgNPs, which was further confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The kinetics of formation of AgNPs were monitored by time-resolved spectrophotometric and X-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that the NP formation is an autocatalytic process with a rate constant of 1.9 x 10(-2) Min(-1) . The NPs were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques like ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The biogenic AgNPs showed substantial inhibitory activity to Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration values of 2.5, 12.5, 2.5, and 31.25 mug/mL, respectively. The current research provides an insight into the mechanistic aspects of bioreduction and formation of AgNPs.
TI  - Arginine oscillation explains Na+ independence in the substrate/product antiporter CaiT.
AB  - Most secondary-active transporters transport their substrates using an electrochemical ion gradient. In contrast, the carnitine transporter (CaiT) is an ion-independent, l-carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter belonging to the betaine/carnitine/choline transporter family of secondary transporters. Recently determined crystal structures of CaiT from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis revealed an inverted five-transmembrane-helix repeat similar to that in the amino acid/Na(+) symporter LeuT. The ion independence of CaiT makes it unique in this family. Here we show that mutations of arginine 262 (R262) make CaiT Na(+)-dependent. The transport activity of R262 mutants increased by 30-40% in the presence of a membrane potential, indicating substrate/Na(+) cotransport. Structural and biochemical characterization revealed that R262 plays a crucial role in substrate binding by stabilizing the partly unwound TM1' helix. Modeling CaiT from P. mirabilis in the outward-open and closed states on the corresponding structures of the related symporter BetP reveals alternating orientations of the buried R262 sidechain, which mimic sodium binding and unbinding in the Na(+)-coupled substrate symporters. We propose that a similar mechanism is operative in other Na(+)/H(+)-independent transporters, in which a positively charged amino acid replaces the cotransported cation. The oscillation of the R262 sidechain in CaiT indicates how a positive charge triggers the change between outward-open and inward-open conformations as a unifying critical step in LeuT-type transporters.
TI  - Frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteremia isolates in patients with urinary tract infection: results from United States and European hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  - We evaluated the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients with UTI from European (EU) and United States (USA) hospitals during a 3-year period (2009-2011). Susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method on 2071 Gram-negative bacilli. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (63.3/71.3% in USA/EU), Klebsiella spp. (16.7/11.2%) and Proteus mirabilis (6.4/5.0%). Escherichia coli susceptibility rates were generally similar in the USA and EU, with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates at 8.1% in both regions. Among Klebsiella spp., ESBL rates varied from 11.4/17.1% in 2009 to 16.1/40.4% in 2011 in USA/EU, and susceptibility rates were generally lower in EU compared to the USA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited lower susceptibility rates to ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam in EU (78.4, 78.4 and 76.5%, respectively) compared to USA (91.2, 88.2 and 91.2%, respectively). In summary, very few antimicrobials provided satisfactory coverage (>90%) when tested against Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa isolates in EU.
TI  - Phytochemical study and screening for antimicrobial activity of flavonoids of Euphorbia hirta.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to phytochemical and antimicrobial study of Euphorbia  hirta Euphorbiaceae). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids (free and bound) of Euphorbia hirta L. was determined by disc diffusion assay against four bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Candida albicans). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract was evaluated through micro broth dilution method, while minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration was determined by subculturing the relevant samples. Total activity (TA) of extracts against each sensitive pathogen was also evaluated. RESULTS: Out of fungi; A. flavus, A. niger, and T. mentagrophytes were found to be resistant, against which none of the tested extracts showed activity. Bound flavonoids extract of root showed best activity against C. albicans (inhibition zone (IZ) 27.66, MIC 0.039, minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) 0.039). TA of free flavonoid extract of root was found to be the same for P. mirabilis and S. aureus (192.30 ml/g). Two flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol were identified in the bound flavonoids of stem extract which showed activity against all the microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Results of the present investigation indicate that E. hirta has good antimicrobial activity with low range of MIC, hence can be exploited for future plant-based antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Strain differences in the humoral immune response to commensal bacterial antigens in rats.
AB  - We have investigated the immune response to commensal bacterial species in the two inbred rat strains: Dark Agouti (DA) and Albino Oxford (AO). The predominant Gram-negative aerobe in our rats' intestinal bacterial flora was Escherichia coli, while Proteus mirabilis was isolated only from DA rat strain. We report that sera from both DA and AO rat strains contain specific IgG against predominant intestinal flora. Intramuscular administration of commensal bacterial antigens provoked only Th1-type antibody response in AO rats while DA rats developed mixed Th1- and Th2-type antibody response to E. coli and Th1-type response to P. mirabilis antigens. Weaker antibody production to own E. coli and higher serum levels of natural IgG and IgA P. mirabilis-specific antibodies combined with higher CD3+ cells proliferation was found in AO rats. Strain difference in the pattern of antibody production and differential regulation of immune response to commensal bacteria may contribute to the marked differences in the immune reactivity of AO and DA rats.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the United States during 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) from 19 hospital sites within the United States. Susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. METHODS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ESBL (ESBL) isolates were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's recommended phenotypic test. Isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom MicroScan dehydrated broth microdilution panels ESBLs and carbapenemases were characterized using the Check-Points microarray. Strain typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-PCR on the DiversiLab System. RESULTS: The majority of isolates were Escherichia coli (36%), K. pneumoniae (18.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). Incidence of ESBL-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. Against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against ESBL-positive isolates of E. coli. All other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. Against K. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against ESBL-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (KPC2 or KPC3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an ESBL remained susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.
TI  - Increased serum procalcitonin levels in pregnant patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the pregnancy urinary tract infections, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the most common one. Untreated ASB can progress to pyelonephritis in 30-50% of the patients and can also result in prematurity in 27% of the pregnancy so it needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we wanted to evaluate procalcitonin levels, compared to other inflammatory in pregnant women with ASB. METHODS: The study was designed between the period of January 2012 and February 2013 at Sakarya University School of Medicine, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. The study population included 30 pregnant patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and 39 healthy pregnant controls. RESULTS: Mean age was 28 (SD, 5.5) of the study population; mean maternal weight was 70 (SD, 8) kilogram. There were no statically significant differences between the groups according to the routine biochemical parameters, but gestational age was significantly lower in the ASB group compared to the controls (20.4 vs 28.6, respectively; p < 0.001). Serum procalcitonin levels were negative in all of the controls. In ASB group, 9 (30%) patients had procalcitonin levels greater than >0.05 ng/ml and 21(70%) patients had negative procalcitonin levels (Chi-squrae, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin assay for ASB was calculated as 30% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 100% and the negative predictive value was 65%. The most frequent microorganisms in the urine culture were Escherichia coli (26 patients, 87%), Proteus mirabilis (3 patients, 10%) and Klebsiella (1 patient, 3%) in the ASB group. We experienced four (44%) recurrences among nine positive procalcitonin in ASB patients after completion of treatment of the first ASB diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in ASB group than the control group and serum procalcitonin levels were higher in pregnant women with recurrent ASB. This finding is an important result revealed that high procalcitonin level can predict the further urinary tract infection risk. Finally, serum procalcitonin levels were normal in healthy pregnant women while other inflammatory markers such as WBC, ESR and CRP levels were higher.
TI  - An Increase in the clinical isolation of acquired AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Korea from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - We investigated the occurrence and genetic basis of AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC)-mediated antibiotic resistance, by examining Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates at a university hospital, from 2007 to 2010. The ampC genes were detected by multiplex AmpC PCR, and AmpC-positive strains were subjected to DNA sequencing. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was assessed using the ESBL disk test based on the utilization of boronic acid. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were further investigated by the modified Hodge test, a carbapenemase inhibition test and SDS-PAGE experiments. AmpC expression was detected in 1.6% of E. coli (39 DHA-1, 45 CMY-2, and 1 CMY-1) isolates, 7.2% of K. pneumoniae (39 DHA-1, 45 CMY-2, and 1 CMY-1) isolates, and 2.5% of P. mirabilis (8 CMY-2 and 1 CMY-1) isolates. Of the 198 acquired AmpC producers, 58 isolates (29.3%) also produced an ESBL enzyme. Among the acquired AmpC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) MIC50/MIC90 values for cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem were >32/>32, 16/>32, 1/16, 0.25/0.5, and <0.125/0.125 microg/mL, respectively. The MIC values for carbapenem were >/=2 microg/mL for 2 K. pneumoniae isolates, both of which carried the bla DHA-1 gene with a loss of OmpK36 expression, but were negative for carbapenemase production. The acquisition of AmpC-mediated resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates increased, as did the proportion of AmpC and ESBL co-producers among the hospital isolates. The accurate identification of isolates producing AmpCs and ESBLs may aid in infection control and will assist physicians in selecting an appropriate antibiotic regimen.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Potential of the Lichen Parmotrema sp. Extracts against Various Pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): The ongoing increasing antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest  challenges faced by global public health. The perennial need for new antimicrobials against a background of increasing antibiotic resistance in pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms obliges the scientific community to constantly develop new drugs and antimicrobial agents. Lichens are known prolific sources of natural antimicrobial drugs and biologically active natural products. This study was aimed to explore in vitro antimicrobial activity of lichen Parmotrema sp. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The methanol and aqueous extracts of lichen Parmotrema sp. was extracted using Soxhlet extractor. Antibiotic assessment of methanol and aqueous extracts was done against eight bacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Enterococci faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,) clinical pathogens and five plant pathogenic fungal strains (Aspergillus terreus strain JAS1, Scedosporium sp. JAS1, Ganoderma sp. JAS4, Candida tropicalis and Fusarium sp.) by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: The methanol lichen Parmotrema sp. extract inhibited all the test organisms. The highest antibacterial activity was found against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The weakest activity was manifested in Salmonella sp. and Scedosporium sp. JAS1. Strong antifungal effect was found against Ganoderma sp. JAS4 and Fusarium sp. The aqueous lichen Parmotrema sp. extract revealed neither antibacterial nor antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that tested lichen Parmotrema sp. extracts demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect. That suggests the active components from methanol extracts of the investigated lichen Parmotrema sp. can be used as natural antimicrobial agent against pathogens.
TI  - A glutathione S-transferase from Proteus mirabilis involved in heavy metal resistance and its potential application in removal of Hg(2)(+).
AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional proteins playing important roles in detoxification of harmful physiological and xenobiotic compounds in organisms. In our study, a gene encoding a GST from Proteus mirabilis strain V7, gstPm-4, was cloned and conditionally expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The purified GstPm-4 protein, with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 23kDa, was able to conjugate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and bind to the GSH-affinity matrix. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR suggested that mRNA level of gstPm-4 was increased in the presence of CdCl2, CuCl2, HgCl2 and PbCl2, respectively. Correspondingly, overexpression of gstPm-4 in the genetically engineered bacterium Top10/pLacpGst exhibited higher heavy metal resistance compared to the control Top10/pLacP3. Another genetically engineered bacterium Top10/pBATGst, in which the DNA encoding GstPm-4 protein was fused with the DNA encoding Pfa1-based auto surface display system, was built. Top10/pBATGst could constitutively express the chimeric GstPm-4 and anchor it onto the cell surface subsequently. Almost 100% of the Hg(2+) within the range of 0.1-100 nM was adsorbed by Top10/pBATGst, and 80% of the bounded Hg(2+) could be desorbed from bacterial cells when pH was adjusted to 6.0. Thus, Top10/pBATGst can be potentially used for efficient treatment of Hg(2+)-contaminated aquatic environment.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four Enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) collected from Taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against Escherichia coli (n = 344), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 78). Susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in 2013. The double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to confirm production of ESBL for isolates with cephalosporin MIC >/= 2 mug/mL. RESULTS: A total of 175 isolates were verified as ESBL producers. The rates of cefepime susceptibility among the ESBL-producing isolates, according to CLSI (EUCAST) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for E. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for K. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for E. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for P. mirabilis. Using different cefepime MIC breakpoints (MICs >/= 16 mug/mL recommended by CLSI criteria and >/= 2 mug/mL by EUCAST criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting ESBL producers among K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae than among the other two species. In addition, we also found that the cefepime MIC level of 1.0 mug/mL best distinguished non-ESBL- from ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae. CONCLUSION: To detect ESBLs, CLSI should revise the cefepime MIC breakpoint against Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - High prevalence of fecal carriage of extended spectrum beta-lactamase/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in cats and dogs.
AB  - Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC producing Enterobacteriaceae have been reported worldwide amongst isolates obtained from humans, food-producing animals, companion animals, and environmental sources. However, data on prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL/AmpC producing Enterobacteriaceae in healthy companion animals is limited. This pilot study describes the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC encoding genes in healthy cats and dogs, and cats and dogs with diarrhea. Twenty fecal samples of each group were cultured on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/L cefotaxime and in LB-enrichment broth supplemented with 1 mg/L cefotaxime, which was subsequently inoculated on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/L cefotaxime. ESBL/AmpC genes were identified using the Check-Points CT103 micro array kit and subsequently by sequencing analysis. Chromosomal ampC promoter mutations were detected by PCR and sequencing analysis. From the healthy and diarrheic dogs, respectively 45 and 55% were positive for Escherichia coli with reduced susceptibility for cefotaxime. From the healthy and diarrheic cats, the estimated prevalence was respectively 0 and 25%. One diarrheic cat was positive for both reduced susceptible E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. The ESBL/AmpC genes found in this study were mainly bla CTX-M-1, but also bla CTX-M-14, bla CTX-M-15, bla TEM-52-StPaul, bla SHV-12, and bla CMY-2 were detected. This pilot study showed that the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC producing Enterobacteriaceae in healthy and diarrheic dogs, and diarrheic cats was relatively high. Furthermore, the genes found were similar to those found in isolates of both human and food-producing animal origin. However, since the size of this study was relatively small, extrapolation of the data to the general population of cats and dogs should be done with great care.
TI  - Deep wound infections after spinal fusion in children with cerebral palsy: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. OBJECTIVE: To (1) calculate the rate of deep wound infection in children with cerebral palsy (CP) after spinal fusion surgery; (2) identify factors (patient, laboratory, and surgical) associated with deep wound infection development; and (3) report causative organisms. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Wound infection after spine fusion for CP is more common than after spine fusion for most other diagnoses. METHODS: We prospectively gathered data on 204 consecutive pediatric patients with CP who underwent surgery at 7 institutions. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyze patient, laboratory, and surgical characteristics to identify factors that were significantly associated with infection development. Statistical significance was set at a value of P less than 0.05. RESULTS: Deep wound infection developed in 13 (6.4%) children. The mean time to infection development was 34.2 +/- 60.2 days. On univariate analysis, older age, larger curve size, presence of gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube, higher preoperative serum white blood cell count, and longer operative time were significantly associated with deep wound infection. On multivariate analysis, only the presence of a gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube remained significant (1.9-fold risk of deep wound infection compared with patients without tubes). Escherichia coli was the most common organism cultured from the wound sites (5 patients). Other infective agents were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and polymicrobial organisms (4). CONCLUSION: Deep wound infection occurred in 6.4% of children with CP after spinal fusion. The presence of a gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube was a significant predictor of infection. Gram-negative organisms were the most common causative agents. Surgeons should be cognizant of these factors when treating children with CP and may consider Gram-negative antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies directed against the outer membrane protein of Bordetella avium.
AB  - Bordetella avium is the etiologic agent of coryza and rhinotracheitis in poultry. This respiratory disease is responsible for substantial economic losses in the poultry industry. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced against the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. avium isolated from diseased chickens. BALB/c mice were immunized with the extracted B. avium OMPs. Then the splenocytes from immunized mice and SP2/0 myeloma cells were fused using PEG 4000. Three stable hybridoma clones (designated as 3G(1)(0), 4A(3), and 4E(8)) were produced via indirect ELISA and three rounds of subcloning. The MAbs were classified as IgG1, and can recognize the 58 kDa OMP band by Western blot assays. No MAb cross-reactivity with chicken Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella was observed. A double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) was developed using the rabbit polyclonal antibodies as the capture antibody and MAb 4A(3) as the detection antibody. Under the DAS-ELISA, the minimum detectable concentration of B. avium was 1 x 10(4) CFU/mL, and no cross-reactivity occurred with chicken Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella. Results showed that the DAS-ELISA has good sensitivity and specificity. Clinical application showed the DAS-ELISA was more sensitive than the plate agglutination test. This study may be used to develop a quick and specific diagnostic kit, analyze epitopes, and establish systems for typing B. avium.
TI  - Class D beta-lactamases: a reappraisal after five decades.
AB  - Despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. These enzymes can be grouped into four classes (A-D). Among the most genetically diverse are the class D beta-lactamases. In this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). Class D beta-lactamases are mostly found in Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , and Acinetobacter baumannii . The active-sites of class D beta-lactamases contain an unusual N-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. A strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with CO2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. The carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. There are more than 250 class D beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. Narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. Extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBLs) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). Mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. More concerning are the class D beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). Whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class D carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. The rotational orientation of the C6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. Inhibition of class D beta-lactamases is a current challenge. Commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class D enzymes. On the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class D enzymes. Several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. These studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class D inactivators.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity and Phytochemical Constituents of Leaf Extracts of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'For centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. In the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of Cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). The aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'Zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). The extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. The antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from Cassia auriculata.
TI  - Prevalence of community acquired urinary tract infections in Silchar Medical College, Assam, India and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to know the rate of prevalence of community  acquired UTI infections in both males and females, Assam, North-East India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 50 mul of urine sample from each of the subjects was streaked on cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient agar medium. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C. Pure, isolated colonies of each type was separately cultured and characterized. The susceptibility of the clinical isolates to routinely prescribed antibiotics in the hospital was performed against various antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the total 40 patients, 26 positive samples were obtained of which 19 females (73.07%) and 7 male (26.92%) patients were shown to be urine culture positive. The most commonly isolated bacterium was Escherichia coli with a frequency rate of (33.3%) followed by Staphyloccous aureus (22.2%), Klebsiella pnemoniae (11.1%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (7.4%), Pseudomonas sp. (7.4%), Proteus myxofaciens (3.7%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Edwardsiella tarda (3.7%), Morganella morganii (3.7%), and Citrobacter fruendii (3.7%). Analysis of the samples showed that UTI was more common in females of younger age group as compared with males. It was also observed that the patients responded effectively to imepenem (IE), cepefime, amikacin, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole antimicrobial agents against Gram-negative bacilli. Furthermore, the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive cocci was found to be ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, IE, and penicillin G (benzyl penicillin). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics have been in use for a long period and more often the misuse of antimicrobial drugs has today led to a general rise in the emergence of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Electrokinetic stringency control in self-assembled monolayer-based biosensors for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  - Rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. The in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates Joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16S rRNA, a phylogenetic biomarker. The dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. With electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. The applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16S rRNA sequences. The results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. Rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. These investigators demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.
TI  - Molecular detection of HpmA and HlyA hemolysin of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the bacterial infections frequently documented in humans. Proteus mirabilis is associated with UTI mainly in individuals with urinary tract abnormality or related with vesicular catheterism and it can be difficult to treat because of the formation of stones in the bladder and kidneys. These stones are formed due to the presence of urease synthesized by the bacteria. Another important factor is that P. mirabilis produces hemolysin HpmA, used by the bacteria to damage the kidney tissues. Proteus spp. samples can also express HlyA hemolysin, similar to that found in Escherichia coli. A total of 211 uropathogenic P. mirabilis isolates were analyzed to detect the presence of the hpmA and hpmB genes by the techniques of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot and hlyA by PCR. The hpmA and hpmB genes were expressed by the RT-PCR technique and two P. mirabilis isolates were sequenced for the hpmA and hpmB genes. The presence of the hpmA and hpmB genes was confirmed by PCR in 205 (97.15 %) of the 211 isolates. The dot blot confirmed the presence of the hpmA and hpmB genes in the isolates that did not amplify in the PCR. None of the isolates studied presented the hlyA gene. The hpmA and hpmB genes that were sequenced presented 98 % identity with the same genes of the HI4320 P. mirabilis sample. This study showed that the PCR technique has good sensitivity for detecting the hpmA and hpmB genes of P. mirabilis.
TI  - Effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in Yersinia, Proteus, Shigella, and Salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. ANIMALS: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. PROCEDURES: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, or Proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. Donor Escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. After coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. RESULTS: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal E coli organisms to Yersinia and Proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin G, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (Salmonella genomic island 1) from Salmonella organisms to Yersinia organisms. Sulfamethazine induced the transfer of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic Salmonella organisms. Six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. Sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. Use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.

TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC-producing enterobacteria in healthy broiler chickens, Germany.
AB  - During 2010, we evaluated the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC-producing enterobacteria in broiler chickens at slaughter. Samples (70 carcasses and 51 ceca) from 4 flocks were analyzed by direct plating and after enrichment. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers were found in 88.6% and 72.5% of carcasses and ceca, respectively; AmpC producers were found in 52.9% and 56.9% of carcasses and ceca, respectively. Most isolates were identified as Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae (cecum) and Proteus mirabilis (carcass) were found in 2 samples each. Molecular characterization revealed the domination of CTX-M genes; plasmidic AmpC was CIT-like. Phylogenetic grouping of E. coli showed types A (31.5%), B1 (20.2%), B2 (13.5%), and D (34.8%). These findings provide evidence that healthy broilers in Germany are a source for the dissemination of transmissible resistance mechanisms in enterobacteria brought from the rearing environment into the food chain during slaughtering.
TI  - Emergence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in Andaman Islands, India.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of India. Patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. Significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes Escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); Klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); Enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and Proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). The uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different resistance patterns. Among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% CI 62.13-100.37%) and 11 (68.8%, 95% CI 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. Multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A total of 7 (44%, 95% CI 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants The present study reports for the first time the presence of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene in two isolates of P. mirabilis in these islands. Detection of multidrug resistant and NDM-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. The study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote Islands.

TI  - Adverse effects of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family on boar sperm quality.
AB  - Semen samples collected in 2012 from 1785 boars belonging to five different breeds were recruited from the quality control laboratory of Magapor SL, Spain. These samples came from 43 boar studs and resulted from diluting the ejaculates in commercial semen extenders. Evaluation of the semen sample characteristics (color, smell, pH, osmolality, concentration, motility of sperm cells, agglutination, acrosome integrity, short hypoosmotic swelling test, and abnormal forms) revealed that they met the international standards. The samples were also tested for the presence of aerobic bacterial contamination. In the present study, 14.73% (n = 263) of the semen samples were contaminated above 3 x 10(2) colony-forming units/mL with at least one type of bacteria. The Enterobacteriaceae family was by far the major contaminant, being present in 40.68% of the contaminated samples (n = 107). Bacterial strains of the Enterobacteriaceae family isolated from boar semen samples were in order of incidence (percentage of the contaminated samples): Serratia marcescens (12.55%), Klebsiella oxytoca (11.79%), Providencia stuartii (9.12%), Morganella morganii (3.80%), Proteus mirabilis (1.90%), and Escherichia coli (1.52%). We have seen that the presence in semen samples of S. marcescens, K. oxytoca, M. morganii, or P. mirabilis, but not P. stuartii or E. coli, was negatively associated with sperm motility (P < 0.05). The mean sperm concentration (P < 0.05), the mean percentage of spermatozoa with curled tails after the short hypoosmotic swelling test (P < 0.01), and the incidence of morphologically normal acrosomes (P < 0.05) were also lower in semen samples infected with M. morganii compared with uninfected ones. Moreover, P. mirabilis was negatively associated with the presence of abnormal forms. Thus, on the basis of the pathological effects that some of these strains may have on boar sperm quality, bacterial contamination should always be examined in semen samples prepared for artificial insemination.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium L.) leaves and flowers.
AB  - Since the aetiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) is still unknown, the use of medicinal herb extracts and products prepared thereof are recommended due to their antimicrobial activity, especially during early stages of BHP. A comparison was performed of the in vitro antimicrobial activity (using broth microdilution assay) of flowers and leaves of willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium L., Onagraceae) from Mt. Velebit (Croatia). The strains (standard ATCC and clinical isolates) of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli (including p-fimbriae positive strain), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were susceptible with MIC values between 4.6+/-0.2 and 18.2+/-0.8 mg/mL. The results of in vitro studies showed that no differences were found in the antimicrobial activity between the ethanol extracts of leaves and flowers of E. angustifolium. Using the quantitative fluorescent assay with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, the viability of C. albicans ATCC 10231 was assessed after in vitro exposure to E. angustifolium leaf and flower ethanol extracts. Apoptosis of C. albicans blastospores dominated over necrosis in all treated samples after short-term exposure with 6 to 12 mg/mL of extracts. In addition to the valuable biological activity of E. angustifolium extracts, the data obtained from the in vitro diffusion, the dilution assay and antifungal viability fluorescent assay suggest that leaf and flower ethanol extracts of E. angustifolium L. are a promising complementary herbal therapy of conditions such as BHP.

TI  - In vitro assessment of antioxidant and antibacterial activities of six edible plants from Iran.
AB  - The antioxidant and antibacterial activities of six edible plants were evaluated. The active constituents of the edible plants were extracted using boiling water or 80% methanol. Results demonstrated that extraction of antioxidants by boiling water was more efficient. Lycium depressum and Berula angustifolia had the highest antioxidant activities and, therefore, could be rich sources of natural antioxidants. The antibacterial activities of the extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Entrococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Further research is needed to isolate, characterize, and identify the bioactive compounds present in these plants.
TI  - Comparison of double disk synergy test, VITEK 2 and Check-MDR CT102 for detection of ESBL producing isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to define the statistical significance for detection of  ESBL producers by the double disk synergy test and molecular test (Check-MDR CT102), microdilution test (VITEK 2 with AES) and double disk synergy test (DDST), as well as the microdilution test and molecular test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phenotypic testing of 55 isolates Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli (14/55), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34/55), Klebsiella oxytoca (3/55) and Proteus mirabilis (4/55) was performed by VITEK 2 Compact/AES. When this test showed positive results for the ESBL phenotype, then DDST with amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, aztreonam, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin disks was performed along with Check-MDR CT102 which identified CTX-M, TEM and SHV beta-lactamases. RESULTS: Applying the McNemar test, we determined that there was a statistically significant difference in the results of detection of ESBLs bacteria using DDST compared to molecular methods (95% CI=41.92 to 54.55; p<0.0001), as well as a DDST and VITEK 2/AES (95% CI=40.13 to 52.73; p<0.0001). We did not find any statistically significant difference in the results of detection of ESBL producers using molecular techniques and VITEK 2/AES (CI=-4,43 to 5,36; p=1). Also we did not find any statistical.. difference between the resistance to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone (50/50) compared to the results of molecular tests. CONCLUSION: In routine daily testing, good detection of ESBLs bacteria, especially CTX-M can be obtained with phenotypic methods with VITEK 2/AES and by DDST with cefpodoxime, and ceftriaksone disks.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial motility and spreading via release of cranberry derived materials from silicone substrates.
AB  - The motility of bacteria plays a key role in their colonization of surfaces during infection. Derivatives of cranberry fruit have been shown to interfere with bacterial motility. Herein, we report on the incorporation of cranberry derived materials (CDMs) into silicone substrates with the aim of impairing bacterial pathogen motility and spreading on the substrate surface. The release of CDMs from the silicone substrates when soaking in an aqueous medium was quantified for a period of 24h. Next, we showed that CDMs released from two silicone substrates remain bioactive as they downregulate the expression of the flagellin gene of two key uropathogens - Escherichia coli CFT073 and Proteus mirabilis HI4320. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDM-modified silicone inhibits the swarming motility of P. mirabilis, an aggressive swarmer. The bioactive, CDM-modified substrates can find broad applications in the medical device and food industries where the impairment of bacterial colonization of surfaces is of paramount importance.
TI  - The joint in vitro action of polymyxin B and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. For topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to elucidate the in vitro activity of polymyxin B and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates from three European countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. ANIMALS: Seventeen strains of Escherichia coli, 24 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in Germany, France and Italy. METHODS: Drug activities were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration. The potentiation of polymyxin B plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). An FICI </=0.5 defined synergy. Furthermore, geographical variations in the FICI and MIC were assessed by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different European countries, because there were no significant MIC and FICI variations (P > 0.05). As a single agent, polymyxin B had bactericidal activity against most E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against S. pseudintermedius strains. Miconazole was bactericidal against all Staphylococcus strains. Synergy was demonstrated against strains of E. coli and P. aeruginosa (FICI = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against S. pseudintermedius strains (FICI = 1.25). Proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In vitro synergy of polymyxin B and miconazole against E. coli and P. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.
TI  - In-Vitro, Anti-Bacterial Activities of Aqueous Extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and Shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in Persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. METHODS: The well diffusion method (KB testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. RESULTS: A particular combination of Acacia catechu (L.F.) Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an outstanding anti-bacterial activity. It's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is significant when compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. The highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (Table1). CONCLUSION: The results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of Acacia catechu, Castanea sativa husk, Ephedra sp. and Mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in formula number 2 (ASLAN()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. These results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae causing urinary  tract infections in Africa.
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults in Africa. The PubMed database was systematically searched to identify relevant studies published after 2000. Google, World Health Organization, and African Field Epidemiology networks were also searched. Twenty-eight studies, accounting for 381,899 urine isolates from 14 African countries, met the inclusion criteria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp. were the most commonly encountered uropathogens. Cefotaxime, imipenem, fosfomycin, and ciprofloxacin were the antibiotics with the highest activity against E. coli isolates from outpatients, with susceptibility being 92 to 99, 100, 100, and 68 to 91%, respectively. The susceptibility among Klebsiella spp. isolates from outpatients varied from 80 to 100% for amikacin and from 53 to 100% for ciprofloxacin, while susceptibility was 74 to 78, 97, and 77% for ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and fosfomycin, respectively, among Klebsiella species isolates from inpatients or patients with hospital-acquired UTIs. With regard to Proteus spp., the highest activity was observed among fluoroquinolones; 71 to 100% of the P. mirabilis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin in four studies, and 74 to 100% of the P. vulgaris isolates were susceptible to ofloxacin in two studies. The currently available evidence suggests that the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Enterobacteriaceae uropathogens in African countries were similar to those in countries of southeast Europe. Further original studies are warranted from African countries for which there is limited published data.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prulifloxacin in comparison with other fluoroquinolones against community-acquired urinary and respiratory pathogens isolated in Greece.
AB  - Prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone rather recently introduced in certain European countries. We compared the antimicrobial potency of ulifloxacin with that of other fluoroquinolones against common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens. The microbial isolates were prospectively collected between January 2007 and May 2008 from patients with community-acquired infections in Greece. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (for respiratory isolates only), and ulifloxacin using the E-test method. The binary logarithms of the MICs [log2(MICs)] were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. A total of 409 isolates were studied. Ulifloxacin had the lowest geometric mean MIC for the 161 Escherichia coli, 59 Proteus mirabilis, and 22 Staphylococcus saprophyticus urinary isolates, the second lowest geometric mean MIC for the 38 Streptococcus pyogenes respiratory isolates (after moxifloxacin), and the third lowest geometric mean MIC for the 114 Haemophilus influenzae and the 15 Moraxella catarrhalis respiratory isolates (after ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Compared with levofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(MICs) against E. coli (p < 0.001), P. mirabilis (p < 0.001), S. saprophyticus (p < 0.001), and S. pyogenes (p < 0.001). Compared with ciprofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(MICs) against P. mirabilis (p < 0.001), S. saprophyticus (p = 0.008), and S. pyogenes (p < 0.001), but higher log2(MICs) against H. influenzae (p < 0.001) and M. catarrhalis (p = 0.001). In comparison with other clinically relevant fluoroquinolones, ulifloxacin had the most potent antimicrobial activity against the community-acquired urinary isolates studied and very good activity against the respiratory isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Bacteria species identification by the statistical analysis of bacterial colonies Fresnel patterns.
AB  - It was demonstrated that statistical analysis of bacteria colonies Fresnel patterns recorded in the optical system with converging spherical wave illumination is suitable for highly effective bacteria species classification. The proposed method includes Fresnel patterns recording followed by image processing and the statistical analysis based on feature extraction, feature selection, classification and classification performance methods. Examination performed on various bacteria species (Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter freundii) revealed that the proposed method achieved very high accuracy of over 98%.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from urine samples collected from community patients in a large metropolitan area, 2010-2012.
AB  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of large cohorts of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from  urine collected in the community are scarce. We report the susceptibilities of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from urine of non-selected community populations in a metropolitan area (Leeds and Bradford, UK) over 2 years. Isolates (n = 6614) were identified as follows: Escherichia coli (n = 5436), Klebsiella spp. (n = 525), Proteus mirabilis (n = 305), and 15 other species (n = 290); 58 isolates were unidentified. Ampicillin resistance was observed in 53% E. coli and 28% P. mirabilis; >/=34% E. coli and P. mirabilis were non-susceptible to trimethoprim compared to 20% Klebsiella spp.; nitrofurantoin resistance was observed in 3% E. coli and 15% Klebsiella spp. The occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was low (6%), as was non-susceptibility to carbapenems, cefipime and tigecycline (<2%). Further surveillance is required to monitor this level of resistance and additional clinical studies are needed to understand the impact on the outcome of current empirical prescribing decisions.
TI  - Dieselzymes: development of a stable and methanol tolerant lipase for biodiesel production by directed evolution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biodiesels are methyl esters of fatty acids that are usually produced by base catalyzed transesterification of triacylglyerol with methanol. Some lipase enzymes are effective catalysts for biodiesel synthesis and have many potential advantages over traditional base or acid catalyzed transesterification. Natural lipases are often rapidly inactivated by the high methanol concentrations used for biodiesel synthesis, however, limiting their practical use. The lipase from Proteus mirabilis is a particularly promising catalyst for biodiesel synthesis as it produces high yields of methyl esters even in the presence of large amounts of water and expresses very well in Escherichia coli. However, since the Proteus mirabilis lipase is only moderately stable and methanol tolerant, these properties need to be improved before the enzyme can be used industrially. RESULTS: We employed directed evolution, resulting in a Proteus mirabilis lipase variant with 13 mutations, which we call Dieselzyme 4. Dieselzyme 4 has greatly improved thermal stability, with a 30-fold increase in the half-inactivation time at 50 degrees C relative to the wild-type enzyme. The evolved enzyme also has dramatically increased methanol tolerance, showing a 50-fold longer half-inactivation time in 50% aqueous methanol. The immobilized Dieselzyme 4 enzyme retains the ability to synthesize biodiesel and has improved longevity over wild-type or the industrially used Brukholderia cepacia lipase during many cycles of biodiesel synthesis. A crystal structure of Dieselzyme 4 reveals additional hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in Dieselzyme 4 compared to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that polar interactions may become particularly stabilizing in the reduced dielectric environment of the oil and methanol mixture used for biodiesel synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Directed evolution was used to produce a stable lipase, Dieselzyme 4, which could be immobilized and re-used for biodiesel synthesis. Dieselzyme 4 outperforms the industrially used lipase from Burkholderia cepacia and provides a platform for still further evolution of desirable biodiesel production properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of inpatient urinary tract isolates of gram-negative bacilli in the United States: results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (SMART) program: 2009-2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends is an ongoing global surveillance program that has monitored the susceptibilities of Gram-negative bacilli from inpatient urinary tract infections (UTIs) since late 2009. OBJECTIVE: This analysis reports on the in vitro susceptibility of 2,135 isolates collected by 24 US sites from hospitalized patients with UTIs between 2009 and 2011. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations and susceptibility were determined according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Of the isolates collected, 88.6% (1,892) were Enterobacteriaceae, which included 48.9% (n = 1,045) Escherichia coli, 14.5% (n = 310) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.4% (n = 136) Proteus mirabilis, 2.5% (n = 54) Klebsiella oxytoca, and 16.3% (n = 347) other Enterobacteriaceae species. Overall, 6.8% of E coli, 10.3% of K pneumoniae, 3.7% of P mirabilis, and 11.1% of K oxytoca isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 67.5% were community associated and 26.9% were hospital associated (5.7% had no demographics). Highest overall rates of activity for the study period were seen with amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem. The least active antimicrobials tested were ampicillin-sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin were the most active study drugs against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, although the activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K pneumoniae did not exceed 69% throughout the study period. The results of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends surveillance study document the rates of antimicrobial resistance in UTI pathogens in the United States, which can assist health care practitioners in selecting the appropriate treatment for UTIs.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region: results of the study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Asia-Pacific region were investigated. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. A total of 699 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with positive genotypic results, included Escherichia coli (n = 443), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), Morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of Enterobacter asburiae, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri were analyzed. Nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated IAI. CTX-M (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with CTX-M-15) was the most common ESBL, followed by SHV (n = 59) and TEM (n = 4). CMY (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with CMY-2) was the most common AmpC beta-lactamase, followed by DHA (n = 46) and ACT/MIR (n = 40). NDM (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with NDM-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by IMP (n = 7) and OXA (n = 7). Isolates from hospital-associated IAI had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. Carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from India, except that IMP beta-lactamases were also detected in Philippines and Australia. CTX-M beta-lactamases were the predominant ESBLs produced by Enterobacteriaceae causing IAI in the Asia-Pacific region. Emergence of CTX-M-15-, CMY-2-, and NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.
TI  - Hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  - Hydramacin-1 (HM1) from the metazoan Hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. Notably, HM1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. To date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. Here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of HM1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. The high binding constants of HM1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain SWT(K/R) motifs. The residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 A and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. Our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. Furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by HM1 was observed for a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.
TI  - In silico maturation of binding-specificity of DNA aptamers against Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a prominent cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) among patients undergoing long-term bladder catheterization. There are currently no effective means of preventing P. mirabilis infections, and strategies for prophylaxis and rapid early diagnosis are urgently required. Aptamers offer significant potential for development of countermeasures against P. mirabilis CAUTI and are an ideal class of molecules for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we demonstrate the application of Cell-SELEX to identify DNA aptamers that show high affinity for P. mirabilis. While the aptamers identified displayed high affinity for P. mirabilis cells in dot blotting assays, they also bound to other uropathogenic bacteria. To improve aptamer specificity for P. mirabilis, an in silico maturation (ISM) approach was employed. Two cycles of ISM allowed the identification of an aptamer showing 36% higher specificity, evaluated as a ratio of binding signal for P. mirabilis to that for Escherichia coli (also a cause of CAUTI and the most common urinary tract pathogen). Aptamers that specifically recognize P. mirabilis would have diagnostic and therapeutic values and constitute useful tools for studying membrane-associated proteins in this organism.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough UTI or not. METHODS: We compared children with infantile VUR with recurrent UTI (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent UTI (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). The following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of UTI episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). RESULTS: Univariate Cox survival-time regression showed that younger age at first UTI, a non-Escherichia coli strain, bilateral and VUR, high-grade VUR, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (USG) significantly increased the risks of recurrent UTI (P <.05 each). In multivariate analysis, timing of the UTI episode (P = .015), a non-E. coli strain (P = .003), high grade (P = .012), and bilateral VUR (P = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI. Non-E. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent UTI, respectively. CONCLUSION: During the first year of life, the earlier the first UTI then the higher the chance is for recurrent UTIs. Higher grades of reflux, bilateral VUR, and the first infection by a non-E. coli strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent UTIs.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - Epidemiology and susceptibility of Gram-negative appendicitis pathogens: SMART 2008-2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) has  tracked the in vitro activity of ertapenem and comparators against aerobic gram-negative bacteria from intra-abdominal infections since 2002. This report describes the epidemiology and susceptibility for clinical isolates associated with appendicitis, collected from 2008 to 2010. METHODS: A total of 1,720 gram-negative bacilli were collected from patients with appendicitis in 122 hospitals in 39 countries worldwide; of these, 23% of isolates were from pediatric patients (</= 17 years old). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes were determined by broth microdilution and interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: The global ESBL-positive rate was 16.3%, ranging from 2.2% for Proteus mirabilis to 16.6% for Escherichia coli and 20.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The ESBL-positive rates differed by age group (17.7% in adults vs. 11.4% in children) and by geographic region, with significantly higher rates in Asia/Pacific (28.0%) and significantly lower rates in North America (9.1%), Africa/Middle East (4.8%), and Europe (4.4%). Amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ertapenem were the most active of the tested agents against aerobic gram-negative appendicitis pathogens across pediatric and adult age groups and across geographic regions, including ESBL-positive isolates. Cefepime and ceftazidime were active against >/= 90% of global pediatric isolates. E. coli, by far the most frequently isolated species (68% in adults and 75% in pediatric patients), was significantly less susceptible in adults than in pediatric patients (p<0.05; Fisher exact test) to all tested agents except amikacin, ertapenem, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam (with the latter showing low activity in both age groups). CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro data suggest that amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ertapenem would perform well against aerobic gram-negative bacilli associated with appendicitis in both adults and children, especially in regions with high rates of ESBL-positive E. coli.
TI  - Community spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli,  Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis: a long-term study in Japan.
AB  - Community-acquired infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, particularly CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli, are a rising concern worldwide. There are few data from Japan on the acquisition of ESBLs in the community or the influx of these bacteria into hospitals. Therefore, we examined the prevalence of ESBL carriage in outpatients, in order to estimate the spread of ESBLs in community settings. We analysed bacterial isolates from outpatient samples at our institution over a 9-year period from 2003 to 2011, with respect to epidemiological data on ESBL-producing bacteria and their genotypic features. Out of 5137 isolates, 321 (6.3 %) were ESBL producers, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The detection rates of the ESBL-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 14.3, 8.7 and 19.6 % for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis strains, respectively, in 2011. Genotyping analysis showed that many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases, including TEM, SHV and CTX-M, rather than just CTX-M. The CTX-M-9 group was dominant among the CTX-M genotypes; further, the CTX-M-1 and M-2 groups were also detected (~30 %). This is believed to be the first report from Japan showing a definite increase in ESBL detection in outpatients. In addition, our findings suggest the simultaneous community spread of diverse ESBL genotypes, not an expansion of particular ESBL genes.
TI  - Outcomes in UK patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia and the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: There is lack of contemporary outcome data on patients with hospital-acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. We determined the risk factors for 7-day mortality and investigated the hypothesis that, compared with central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic urinary tract infections (UTIs) were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. METHODS: From October 2007 to September 2008, demographical, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia. Patients were followed until death, hospital discharge or recovery from infection. Risk factors for 7-day mortality were determined and multivariate logistic regression was used to define the association between catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs and likelihood of death. RESULTS: 559 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 437 patients. Overall, there were 90 deaths (20.6%) at 7 days and 153 deaths (35.0%) at 30 days. Among patients with catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs, 7-day and 30-day mortalities associated with each bacteraemic episode were 25/83 (30.1%) and 33/83 (39.8%), respectively. Within this subgroup, the commonest isolates were Escherichia coli, 36 (43.4%), Proteus mirabilis, 11 (13.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 (10.8%). There were 22 (26.5%) multiple drug-resistant isolates and, of the E coli infections, 6 (16.7%) were extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers. In univariate analysis, the variables found to have the strongest association with 7-day mortality were age, Pitt score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), medical speciality and site of infection. Compared with CVC-associated bacteraemic infections, there was a significant association between catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs and 7-day mortality (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.86 to 9.33). After adjustment for age and CCI, this association remained significant (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.19 to 7.07). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CVC-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. Efforts to reduce these infections should be prioritised.
TI  - Carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important Gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicentre Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2009.
AB  - To investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and Burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by the CLSI as well as 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by EUCAST. Based on CLSI 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. All Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii isolates were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of P. mirabilis and all M. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae with ertapenem MICs>/=4 mg/L were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. Imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, respectively. Additionally, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=8 mg/L were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. These data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=4 mg/L.
TI  - Serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of SSIs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is still high. An improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. Serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: After single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. We found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Aetiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of urinary tract infections in the elderly: a 6-month study.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of bacteraemia in the elderly  and are associated with a high probability of hospitalization. Despite the impact of UTIs on health status and quality of life, a limited number of studies have evaluated their aetiology in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the microbial aetiology and pattern of susceptibility of bacteria causing UTIs in the elderly. For this purpose, a retrospective cohort study of elderly residents (n = 472, aged >65 years) in 14 nursing homes in Milan (Italy) and its province was performed. Globally, 393 micro-organisms from 328 samples were isolated: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent (44.8 %), followed by Proteus mirabilis (20.4 %), Providencia spp. (8.9 %), Klebsiella spp. (6.4 %) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6 %). Enterococci were the most frequently isolated Gram-positive organisms (7.4 %). Almost all Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, carbapenems and amikacin. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 42.1 % of isolates. The most active antibiotics against P. aeruginosa were colistin, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. All Gram-positive organisms were susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid, and 90 % were susceptible to nitrofurantoin. Fluoroquinolones showed a limited activity against all the tested micro-organisms. Escherichia coli remains the major micro-organism responsible for UTIs in older people, although to a lesser extent than in a younger population. The high rates of resistance observed in this study make careful use of antibiotics advisable to limit further development of resistance.
TI  - Study of photodynamic therapy in the control of isolated microorganisms from infected wounds--an in vitro study.
AB  - The effective treatment of infected wounds continues to be a serious challenge, mainly due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) refers to the topical or systemic administration of a non-toxic, photosensitizing agent (PS), followed by irradiation with visible light of a suitable wavelength. The possibility of applying the PDT locally is what makes it so favorable to the treatment of infected wounds. The goal of this study was to evaluate the action of the PDT in the inactivation in vitro of microorganisms coming from infected wounds, using methylene blue (MB) and photodithazine (PDZ) as the PS and comparing the efficacy of these two compounds for PDT on bacteria. For the application of PDT, isolated microorganisms identified from material collected from wounds were suspended in a saline solution containing 10(6) viable cells/ml. Each isolated microorganism was submitted to PDT with MB and with PDZ in accordance with the following treatment groups: N/T--no treatment; T1--PDT with PDZ; T2--PDT with MB; T3--irradiation without PS; T4--treatment with PDZ without light; and T5--treatment with MB without light. As a light source, an LED-based device was used (Biopdi/Irrad-Lead 660), composed of 54 LEDs, each with 70 mW of power in the 660 nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each tray of 96 wells was irradiated with an intensity of 25 mW/cm(2) and a dose of light of 50 J/cm(3) for 33 min. All the tests were made in duplicate. It was then concluded that the PDT with PDZ was capable of inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria samples, however it did not have the same effect on gram-negative bacteria, which showed growth greater than 100,000 CFU; the PDT with MB showed an effectiveness on gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, for it was able to inhibit bacterial growth in both cases.
TI  - Urinary tract infection among symptomatic outpatients visiting a tertiary hospital based in midwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Microbial pathogens implicated in urinary tract infection and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as prevalent in UTI symptomatic outpatients resident in Benin City, Nigeria was the focus of this study. One hundred (100) midstream urine samples were collected into sterile plastic universal bottles from outpatients who visited the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria and who were tentatively diagnosed as manifesting symptoms of UTI. Patients were referred to the Medical Microbiology department by the consulting doctors. Significant bacterial counts and neutrophil (pus cells) counts were carried out on samples by standard methods. Positive samples for both counts were inoculated aseptically on sterile MacConkey agar, Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient (CLED) agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar plates and incubated appropriately. Microbial isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out on isolates by standard methods. Thirty nine (39.0%) and 61 (61.0%) samples recorded significant microbial growth and no growth respectively. Gram negative bacilli constituted 86.1% (of which enterobacteriaceae made up 49.9%) while gram positive cocci made up 13.9%. Strains of uropathogens isolated were Alcaligenes spp (19.4%), Klebsiella aerogenes (16.7%), Escherichia coli (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.9%), Candida albicans (11.1%), Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Enterobacter spp (5.5%) and Providencia spp (5.5%). Occurrence of UTI in male and female patients were 58.3% and 41.7% respectively of which UTI occurred highest in the 25-46, 15-54 and 27-54 age groups in that decreasing order. Alcaligenes spp occurred most in very old female patients. Candida albicans (the only fungal uropathogen) occurred in an 8day old male patient. Other isolates occurred in much older patients. A significantly high microscopic neutrophil count or pyuria was recorded from deposits of UTI positive patients (i.e. &lt; 5/HPF). Eighteen (representing 50.5%) and 15 (47.8%) of total microbial strains isolated were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility profile also showed 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%) for ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and ofloxacin respectively suggesting moderate sensitivity of the fluoroquinolones and second/third generation cephalosporins. Gentamicin, ampicillin and augmentin recorded over 70.0% resistance level each. A total of nineteen bacterial strains made of E.coli, Enterobacter spp, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp, Staph. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi drug resistant as they resisted 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 and 8 antibiotics respectively.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from infected wounds and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern: some remarks about wound infection.
AB  - Wound infection plays an important role in the development of chronicity, delaying wound healing. This study aimed to identify the bacterial pathogens present in infected wounds and characterise their resistance profile to the most common antibiotics used in therapy. Three hundred and twelve wound swab samples were collected from 213 patients and analysed for the identification of microorganisms and for the determination of their antibiotic susceptibility. Patients with diverse type of wounds were included in this retrospective study, carried out from March to September 2012. A total of 28 species were isolated from 217 infected wounds. The most common bacterial species detected was Staphylococcus aureus (37%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Escherichia coli (6%) and Corynebacterium spp. (5%). Polymicrobial infection was found in 59 (27.1%) of the samples and was mainly constituted with two species. The most common association was S. aureus/P. aeruginosa. All Gram-positives were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. Gram-negatives showed quite high resistance to the majority of antibiotics, being amikacin the most active against these bacteria. This study is mostly oriented to health care practitioners who deal with wound management, making them aware about the importance of wound infection and helping them to choose the adequate treatment options to control microbial infection in wounds.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance patterns of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: We characterize the current national patterns of antibiotic resistance of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined outpatient urinary isolates from patients younger than 18 years in 2009 using The Surveillance Network(R), a database with antibiotic susceptibility results and patient demographic data from 195 United States hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns for the 6 most common uropathogens, ie Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We compared differences in uropathogen prevalence between males and females using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: We identified 25,418 outpatient urinary isolates. E. coli was the most common uropathogen overall but the prevalence of E. coli was higher among females (83%) than males (50%, p <0.001). Other common species among males were Enterococcus (17%), P. mirabilis (11%) and Klebsiella (10%). However, these uropathogens each accounted for 5% or less of female isolates (p <0.001). Resistance among E. coli was highest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24%) but lower for nitrofurantoin (less than 1%) and cephalothin (15%). Compared to 2002 Surveillance Network data, E. coli resistance rates increased for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (from 23% to 31% in males and from 20% to 23% in females) and ciprofloxacin (from 1% to 10% and from 0.6% to 4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli remains the most common pediatric uropathogen. Although widely used, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a poor empirical choice for pediatric urinary tract infections in many areas due to high resistance rates. First-generation cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin are appropriate narrow-spectrum alternatives given their low resistance rates. Local antibiograms should be used to assist with empirical urinary tract infection treatment.
TI  - FlgM proteins from different bacteria exhibit different structural characteristics.
AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. The importance of IDPs in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. Our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous FlgM proteins, a model class of IDPs. We have previously shown that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus has more structure at A. aeolicus' physiological temperature (85 degrees C) than is observed for the Salmonella typhimurium FlgM, suggesting that the disordered nature of FlgM varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. In this work, we extend these studies to the FlgM proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that the B. subtilis, E. coli, and S. typhimurium FlgMs exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the B. subtilis FlgM is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. The P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis FlgM proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. The P. aeruginosa FlgM appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the P. mirabilis FlgM. These results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.
TI  - Analysis of the spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens in vitro: results based on a retrospective study from a tertiary hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of uropathogens in urinary tract infections (UTIs) is increasing worldwide. This study aimed to compare the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens in community-acquired UTIs (CAUTIs) and nosocomial-acquired UTIs (NAUTIs) at a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of uropathogens from UTI patients was performed at Zhong Da Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1129 strains was isolated from 653 community-acquired and 476 nosocomial-acquired infections. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen, accounting for 55.9% of the CAUTIs and 27.1% of the NAUTIs. Among the CAUTIs, Escherichia coli was followed in prevalence by Enterococcus spp (12.9%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.7%). Among the NAUTIs, Escherichia coli was followed by Enterococcus spp (15.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9%). The proportion of fungi in the NAUTIs (23.7%) was higher than that in the CAUTIs (3.1%) (P < .05). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of E coli accounted for 70.6% of the NAUTIs and 47.3% of the CAUTIs. Carbapenems, amikacin, and nitrofurantoin were active agents against E coli. The resistance rates of E coli to cephalosporins, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, quinolones, and gentamicin were higher in the NAUTIs than in the CAUTIs (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The distribution of species was different between CAUTIs and NAUTIs. Higher antibiotic resistance rates were observed in the NAUTIs than in the CAUTIs.
TI  - One-step production of alpha-ketoglutaric acid from glutamic acid with an engineered L-amino acid deaminase from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Currently, alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG) is industrially produced by multi-step chemical synthesis, which can cause heavy environmental pollution. Here we reported a simple one-step approach for the production of alpha-KG by transforming l-glutamic acid with an engineered l-amino acid deaminase (l-AAD) from Proteus mirabilis. First, to facilitate the purification of membrane-bound l-AAD, one N-terminal transmembrane region (from 21 to 87th nucleotide) was removed from l-AAD to block the binding of l-AAD with membrane, and the relatively low-usage codons were replaced by high-usage codons in Escherichia coli to improve the expression level. However, inclusion bodies formed when expressing the DeltaN-LAAD in E. coli BL 21, and then the soluble and active DeltaN-LAAD was obtained by the solubilization and renaturation of DeltaN-LAAD. Furthermore, the biochemical properties of the refolded DeltaN-LAAD were characterized and compared with those of full-length l-AAD. Finally, the DeltaN-LAAD was used to synthesize alpha-KG and the maximal formation rate of alpha-KG reached 12.6% (w/w) at 6h under the following conditions: 12g/L l-glutamic acid, 0.1g/L DeltaN-LAAD, 5mM MgCl2, temperature 45 degrees C and pH 8.0. Compared with the multi-step chemical synthesis, the transformation approach has less environmental pollution and has a great potential for alpha-KG production.
TI  - Microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in Central Alabama.
AB  - Urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. They are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. The purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in Central Alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. This was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile at this Central Alabama hospital. The survey period was between July 2009 and June 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed and susceptibility testing was determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microdilution method. The results indicated that Escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). For the 215 E. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, P < 0.05). In contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, P < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this Central Alabama hospital. Additionally, this study found that E. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (Lee et al. 2010; Rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. It is imperative to monitor the resistance of P. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.
TI  - The novel CTX-M-116 beta-lactamase gene discovered in Proteus mirabilis is composed of parts of the CTX-M-22 and CTX-M-23 genes.
AB  - The novel beta-lactamase gene bla(CTX-M-116) was identified in a Proteus mirabilis nosocomial isolate recovered from the urine of a patient in Moscow in 2005. DNA sequence analysis showed bla(CTX-M-116) to be a hybrid gene consisting of 5' bla(CTX-M-23) (nucleotides 1 to 278) and 3' bla(CTX-M-22) (nucleotides 286 to 876) moieties separated by an intervening putative site of recombination (GTTAAAT). A retrospective analysis of available bla(CTX-M) genes in the GenBank database revealed 19 bla(CTX-M) genes that display the same hybrid structure.
TI  - American Journal of Gastroenterology Lecture: Intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - The vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. Starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. Moreover, vital interactions of the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic CDI, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. In addition, FMT has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-CDI diseases is in its infancy. More work needs to be done with FMT to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. There is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. Future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to cure disease. FMT is but the first step in this journey.
TI  - [A model of intestinal infiltrate in conditions of chronic experiment].
AB  - A chronic intestinal infiltrate model, aiming at a typical inflammatory process simulation, was elaborated in experiment. As a result of experiment on 30 rabbits the quantity of colonies of various causative agents was established, which did not cause the abscess and peritonitis formation. While doing the operation in 60 rabbits chronic infiltrate was formed between abducting and adducting small intestine loops, its mesentery and big omentum; between abducting and adducting large intestine loops, its mesentery and big omentum. The infiltrate formation process was studied up on the 3, 7, 14th and 28th day. Dynamics of changes in microorganisms species and quantity were studied, using microbiological investigations data. The stages of chronic intestinal infiltrate formation were followed up, using histological investigations. Application of the method proposed have permitted to form a chronic infiltrate owing predicted course to reduce the experiment duration and the investigated animals quantity.
TI  - Comparison of antibiotic resistance patterns in collections of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis uropathogenic strains.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are important urinary tract pathogens. The constant increase in the antibiotic resistance of clinical bacterial strains has become an important clinical problem. The aim of this study was to compare the antibiotic resistance of 141 clinical (Sweden and Poland) and 42 laboratory (Czech Republic) P. mirabilis strains and 129 clinical (Poland) uropathogenic E. coli strains. The proportion of unique versus diverse patterns in Swedish clinical and laboratory P. mirabilis strain collections was comparable. Notably, a similar proportion of unique versus diverse patterns was observed in Polish clinical P. mirabilis and E. coli strain collections. Mathematical models of the antibiotic resistance of E. coli and P. mirabilis strains based on Kohonen networks and association analysis are presented. In contrast to the three clinical strain collections, which revealed complex associations with the antibiotics tested, laboratory P. mirabilis strains provided simple antibiotic association diagrams. The monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns of clinical E. coli and P. mirabilis strains plays an important role in the treatment procedures for urinary tract infections and is important in the context of the spreading drug resistance in uropathogenic strain populations. The adaptability and flexibility of the genomes of E. coli and P. mirabilis strains are discussed.
TI  - Molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in China.
AB  - The molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in Jinan, China. Out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance were found. These isolates were classified into 19 REP-PCR types. These strains were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and found to be as follows: Proteus mirabilis (16), Escherichia coli (7), Providencia spp. (7), Proteus spp. (2), P. vulgaris (3), Shigella sp. (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). Their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and then either analyzed using PCR-RFLP or sequenced. The typical array dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 was detected in 27 isolates. Six atypical arrays were observed, including three kinds of novel arrangements (linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1-orf441 or linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1, dfrA1-catB2-sat2-aadA1, and estX(Vr)-sat2-aadA1) and a hybrid with the 3'CS of class 1 integrons (dfrA1-sat2-aadA1-qacH), and dfrA1-sat1. Twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. Several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. Results showed that water sources in the Jinan region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - [Purple urine bag syndrome in two institutionalised patients].
AB  - Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is an uncommon but particularly striking phenomenon characterised by a chemical reaction involving the urine, plastic and certain enzymes from some sulphatase- and phosphatase-producing bacteria, including Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii, amongst others. Following this reaction, the catheter and the bag may be stained red, blue or purple. This phenomenon tends to occur in patients with multiple pathology and with urinary catheters, as part of a urinary tract infection. We describe two clinical cases of PUBS in institutionalised patients with permanent urinary catheters.
TI  - Antimicrobial lectin from Schinus terebinthifolius leaf.
AB  - AIMS: Schinus terebinthifolius leaves are used for treating human diseases caused by micro-organisms. This work reports the isolation, characterization and antimicrobial activity of S. terebinthifolius leaf lectin (SteLL). METHODS AND RESULTS: The isolation procedure involved protein extraction with 0.15 mol l(-1) NaCl, filtration through activated charcoal and chromatography of the filtrate on a chitin column. SteLL is a 14-kDa glycopeptide with haemagglutinating activity that is inhibited by N-acetyl-glucosamine, not affected by ions (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) and stable upon heating (30-100 degrees C) as well as over the pH 5.0-8.0. The antimicrobial effect of SteLL was evaluated by determining the minimal inhibitory (MIC), bactericide (MBC) and fungicide (MFC) concentrations. Lectin was active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Highest bacteriostatic and bactericide effects were detected for Salm. enteritidis (MIC: 0.45 mug ml(-1)) and Staph. aureus (MBC: 7.18 mug ml(-1)), respectively. SteLL impaired the growth (MIC: 6.5 mug ml(-1)) and survival (MFC: 26 mug ml(-1)) of Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS: SteLL, a chitin-binding lectin, purified in milligram quantities, showed antimicrobial activity against medically important bacteria and fungi. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: SteLL can be considered as a new biomaterial for potential antimicrobial applications.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant Nigerians  infected with HIV.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are conflicting report on the association of HIV infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Most of these studies were from areas with low HIV burden. This study determined the prevalence and risk factors of ASB in HIV positive pregnant women. METHODS: A cross sectional study among HIV positive pregnant women seen at a large PMTCT clinic in Lagos Nigeria. The women were evaluated for ASB at first clinic attendance. Blood samples were also collected for viral load, CD4 count and hemoglobin levels assessment. Data were managed with SPSS for windows version 19. RESULTS: 102 (18.1%) women out of 563 studied were found positive for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Ninety-seven (95.1%) of the positive samples yielded single bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli (44.3%) and Proteus mirabilis (21.6%) were the most common bacterial isolates. Previous urinary tract infection (OR: 4.3), HIV-1 RNA greater than 10,000 copies/ml (OR: 3.9), CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 (OR: 1.4) and maternal hemoglobin <11 g/dl (OR: 1.4) were factors significantly associated with ASB after controlling for possible confounders. CONCLUSION: ASB is common in HIV positive pregnant women in our environment and is associated with previous UTI, high viral load, low CD4 count and maternal hemoglobin <11 g/dl.
TI  - Contribution of structural domains to the activity of ribonuclease 7 against uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Ribonuclease 7 (RNase 7) is a 14.5-kDa peptide that possesses potent antimicrobial properties against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues. Little is known about its mechanisms of action and the determinants of its antimicrobial properties. The objective of this study was to identify the intrinsic functional domains of RNase 7 that influence its activity against uropathogenic bacteria. A series of RNase 7 fragments were generated that contained different components of its secondary motifs starting from both the N terminus and the C terminus of RNase 7. We determined the antimicrobial properties of each fragment against both Gram-positive Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. RNase 7 fragments displayed significant differences in their antimicrobial activity profiles. Compared to N-terminal fragments, C-terminal fragments showed uniformly decreased activity against Gram-negative E. coli and P. mirabilis and Gram-positive S. saprophyticus. Fragments that lack beta-sheets 1, 3, and 4 also demonstrated significantly decreased activities. We have also identified one fragment with at least 4-fold increased potency against both E. coli and Staphylococcus compared to full-length peptide. We identified distinct regions of the peptide that are independently responsible for Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity. Our results suggest that distinct mechanisms are responsible for RNase 7's antimicrobial activity against various uropathogens.
TI  - The effect of copper(II), iron(II) sulphate, and vitamin C combinations on the weak antimicrobial activity of (+)-catechin against Staphylococcus aureus and other microbes.
AB  - Few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-Catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. Copper(II) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis or Escherichia coli. Attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, S. aureus and E. coli, with iron(II) sulphate, iron(III) chloride, and vitamin C, showed that iron(II) enhanced (+)-catechin against S. aureus, but not E. coli; neither iron(III) nor combined iron(II) and copper(II), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. Vitamin C enhanced copper(II) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(II). Catalase or EDTA added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced H(2)O(2)via the action of added metal(II) ions. H(2)O(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(II) mixtures and copper(II) alone could account for the principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(II) against S. aureus. These novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. Weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-Catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(II) or iron(II) contents in certain crop protection and other products.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - 1-alkyl-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides: inhibitory effect on virulence factors of Candida albicans and on the growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A homologous series of 1-alkyl-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides, termed compounds 1-11, was synthesized and studied for antibacterial and antifungal activity. Of these, compound 8, containing a ten-carbon alkyl chain, showed maximum inhibition against all the tested bacterial strains. The highest antibacterial activity using a disc diffusion method was recorded against Mycobacterium smegmatis [zone of inhibition (ZOI): 45.75+/-0.25 mm], followed by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi. In addition to antibacterial activity, compounds 3-11 displayed good inhibitory action against the human opportunistic yeast pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and various Candida spp. The maximum ZOI was observed against Cryptococcus neoformans (51.5+/-0.5 mm) using compound 8, with ZOIs of 23.5+/-0.5, 32.0+/-0.0, 27.75+/-0.25 and 41.5+/-0.5 mm against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei, respectively. Furthermore, compound 8 caused inhibition of the candidal yeast-hyphae transition at a concentration of 0.29 microM and also inhibited the secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme such as secreted aspartyl proteinase at subinhibitory concentrations. Compound 8 showed very little haemolytic activity at a concentration of 0.58 microM (1.315+/-0.75 %), with its highest haemolytic activity (47.806+/-2.32 %) observed at a concentration of 2.9 microM.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of monodispersed silver nanoparticles using Hibiscus cannabinus leaf extract and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using leaf extract of Hibiscus cannabinus has been investigated. The influences of different concentration of H. cannabinus leaf extract, different metal ion concentration and different reaction time on the above cases on the synthesis of nanoparticles were evaluated. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The prepared silver nanoparticles were monodispersed, spherical in shape with the average particle size of 9 nm and shows surface plasmon peak at 446 nm. The study also reveals that the ascorbic acid present in H. cannabinus leaf extract has been used as reducing agent. The prepared silver nanoparticle shows good antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Shigella flexneri.
TI  - Isolation of pathogenic bacteria from fomites in the operating rooms of a specialist hospital in Kano, North-western Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection constitute over 25% of infection rates in the hospital setting causing significant morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. The aim of this study is to establish the possible presence of known bacteria pathogens on fomites in the operating theatre and evaluate their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. METHODS: Various items in the operating theatre rooms such as forceps, scissors, floor, walls, suction tube, sink, theatre bed covers etc. were screened for the presence of bacterial and fungal pathogens from Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano between Jan - Aug 2009. One thousand eight hundred (1,800) samples were processed. Bacterial and fungal isolates were identified by standard microbiological procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of eight bacteria genera and four fungal species were observed. The following bacterial pathogens were isolated; Escherichia coli (10.0%), Proteus Mirabilis (8.33%), Proteus vulgaris (6.70%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.83%), Streptococcus spp. (18.3%), E. faecalis (3.33%), Coagulase negative staph (28.3%) and Salmonella choleraesius (0.83%). Ofloxacin and ceftriaxone showed encouraging results against the isolates. CONCLUSION: Fomites should be regarded as a possible source of nosocomial infection since bacteria from them can be carried from the hands of theatre personnel to the patient undergoing surgery or through redispersed bacteria from surfaces during surgery.
TI  - Foodborne pathogens recovered from ready-to-eat foods from roadside cafeterias and retail outlets in Alice, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa: public health implications.
AB  - This study assessed the microbiological quality of various ready-to-eat foods sold in Alice, South Africa. Microbiological analysis was conducted on 252 samples which included vegetables, potatoes, rice, pies, beef and chicken stew. The isolates were identified using biochemical tests and the API 20E, API 20NE and API Listeria kits; results were analyzed using the one-way-ANOVA test. Bacterial growth was present in all the food types tested; high levels of total aerobic count were observed in vegetables, 6.8 +/- 0.07 followed by rice, 6.7 +/- 1.7 while pies had the lowest count (2.58 +/- 0.24). Organisms isolated included: Listeria spp. (22%), Enterobacter spp. (18%), Aeromonas hydrophila (12%), Klebsiella oxytoca (8%), Proteus mirabilis (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.2%) and Pseudomonas luteola (2.4%). Interestingly, Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli were not isolated in any of the samples. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the prevalence of foodborne pathogens from hygienic and unhygienic cafeterias. The results indicated that most of the ready-to-eat food samples examined in this study did not meet bacteriological quality standards, therefore posing potential risks to consumers. This should draw the attention of the relevant authorities to ensure that hygienic standards are improved to curtain foodborne infections.
TI  - Risk factors and clinical impact of levofloxacin or cefazolin nonsusceptibility or ESBL production among uropathogens in adults with community-onset urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacilli causing community-onset urinary tract infections (CoUTIs) are getting increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. Clinical significance and risk factors of the acquisition of antimicrobial-nonsusceptible pathogens are still under investigation. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in the medical wards of two hospitals in southern Taiwan between August 2009 and January 2012. Patients were enrolled if they were aged >18, admitted through the emergency department, and had CoUTI due to Enterobacteriaceae isolates. RESULTS: Overall 136 adults with CoUTI were enrolled. Their mean age was 67 years and females were predominant (68.4%). Comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (30.1%) and hypertension (54.4%), were common. Escherichia coli (111, 81.6%) was the predominant species, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (11, 8.1%), and Proteus mirabilis (7, 5.1%). Nine (8.0%) of E. coli isolates and 5 (45%) of K. pneumoniae isolates had extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Out of 122 non-ESBL producing isolates, 35 (28.7%) and 31 (25.4%) were nonsusceptible to levofloxacin and cefazolin, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, several clinical characters were found to be independently associated with CoUTIs due to levofloxacin-nonsusceptible (i.e. males, recent hospitalization, underlying old stroke, diabetes mellitus, and altered consciousness, or absence of chills, pyuria, or tachycardia), cefazolin-nonsusceptible (i.e. males, recent hospitalization, underlying old stroke, absence of fever or chills), or ESBL-producing isolates (i.e. recent hospitalization or antimicrobial therapy). All patients survived and discharged. However, the patients with CoUTIs due to levofloxacin-nonsusceptible (16.1 vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.01), cefazolin-nonsusceptible (15.4 vs. 8.4 days, p < 0.01) or ESBL-producing (16.7 vs. 9.6 days; p < 0.01) pathogens had a longer hospitalization stay than those due to their susceptible comparators. CONCLUSION: Several host factors were recognized to be independently associated with the acquisition of UTIs due to levofloxacin- or cefazolin- nonsusceptible, or ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The clinical impact of UTIs due to nonsusceptible uropathogens is that they result in the prolongation of hospital stays.
TI  - Bacteriuria and safety of female urodynamic studies.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Our aim was to study the incidence of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies (UDS) and prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria before UDS. METHODS: In this prospective study between March and September 2011, 140 women undergoing UDS were subjected to urine culture before the investigation. Urine was collected aseptically with a sterile catheter transurethrally. Multichannel UDS were performed 3-5 days after urine collection. Prophylactic antibiotics were not administered to these women. A second urine sample was collected within 5-7 days after UDS. Significant bacteriuria was defined as 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml or more of a single organism cultured. RESULTS: Thirty (21.4 %) women had asymptomatic bacteriuria before UDS and were excluded from the main study group. Among the 110 women in the study group, 4 (3.6 %) acquired infection after UDS. Three grew organisms found in the vagina (group B Streptococcus and yeast-like organism) and one grew Proteus mirabilis. Age 60 years and above is a significant risk factor. In contrast to the study group, among 30 women who had infection before UDS, Escherichia coli was the commonest pathogen in 19 (63.3 %) and 30 % had diabetes. Eleven (36.7 %) had persistent infection after UDS and the rest resolved spontaneously. In addition, no other related complication was observed on the UDS. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that risk of post UDS bacteriuria is low in women and screening for vaginal infections may be necessary before UDS. Women over 60 years old are significantly at risk of infection. Bacteriuria is nevertheless mostly asymptomatic and transient in nature.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Impact of pH on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although major impairment of activity at lower pH values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Until now, there is little evidence for the influence of pH on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. METHODS: Bacterial growth curves of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Klebsiella oxytoca (ATCC 700324), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 14153), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a pH of between 5.0 and 8.0. Bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the MIC. RESULTS: While no difference in the bacterial growth of E. coli, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca was observed at different pH values, bacterial growth of E. faecalis was significantly reduced at low pH. Acidification to pH 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSION: The present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of UTIs should be carefully considered. While growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during UTIs, the most common pathogen, E. coli, was not affected by low pH. Independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, pH values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - The relative importance of Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a urinary tract pathogen: distribution of bacteria among urinary samples analysed during 1 year at a major Swedish laboratory.
AB  - To determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on Staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large Swedish cohort. S. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (UTI) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of UTIs in this patient group being caused by S. saprophyticus. We hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings. During the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the Karolinska University Hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. Patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. The most common pathogens were E. coli (57.0%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), K. pneumoniae (5.9%), group B streptococci (5.7%), P. mirabilis (3.0%) and S. saprophyticus (1.8%). The majority of subjects with S. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of age (63.8%). In this age group, S. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. S. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with E. coli even in this patient group. For women in other ages and for men, growth of S. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.
TI  - Cefditoren: Comparative efficacy with other antimicrobials and risk factors for resistance in clinical isolates causing UTIs in outpatients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate a possible role of Cefditoren, a recently marketed in  Greece third-generation oral cephalosporin in urinary infections of outpatients. METHODS: During a multicenter survey of Enterobacteriaceae causing UTIs in outpatients during 2005-2007, Cefditoren MICs were determined by agar dilution method in a randomly selected sample of uropathogens. Susceptibility against 18 other oral/parenteral antimicrobials was determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. RESULTS: A total of 563 isolates (330 Escherichia coli, 142 Proteus mirabilis and 91 Klebsiella spp) was studied; MIC50/MIC90 of Cefditoren was 0.25/0.5 mg/L respectively, with 97.1% of the isolates being inhibited at 1 mg/L. All 12 strains producing ESBLs or AmpC enzymes were resistant to cefditoren. Susceptibility rates (%) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin were 93.1- 94.1- 96.8-93.1-71.9 and 92.8% respectively. Cefditoren MIC was significantly higher in nalidixic/ciprofloxacin non-susceptible strains; resistance to cefditoren was not associated with resistance to mecillinam, fosfomycin nitrofurantoin and aminoglycosides. Multivariate analysis demonstrated history of urinary infection in the last two weeks or three months as risk factors for cefditoren resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Cefditoren exhibited enhanced in vitro activity against the most common uropathogens in the outpatient setting, representing an alternative oral treatment option in patients with risk factors for resistance to first-line antibiotics.
TI  - [Randomized comparative study for the assessment of a new therapeutic schedule of fosfomycin trometamol in postmenopausal women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare two therapeutic regimes in terms of bacterial eradication  of post-menopausal with uncomplicated acute cystitis who complete antibiotic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A multicenter, randomized, prospective and controlled study between two short antibiotic regimes: fosfomycin trometamol (FMT) 3g, 2 doses separated by 72hours and ciprofloxacin 250mg every 12hours for 3 days. A total of 118 post-menopausal women were enrolled in the study. They underwent an initial urine culture to know the responsible microorganism and susceptibility to treatment. This was repeated 5-7 days and 4 weeks after the treatment to evaluate bacterial eradication. Clinical symptoms and treatment safety were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were microbiological data at the onset of the treatment in 82 women (69.49%). Of these, 27 did not have positive culture at the first visit (30.51%), 76 (64.41%) fulfilled all the protocol requirements and adverse effects from the treatment were collected in 113 (95.76%) of the patients enrolled in the study. The germs isolated most frequently were Escherichia coli (E. coli) (76.83%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (7.32%), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (4.89%) and Enterococo sp. (3.66%). In terms of efficacy, no differences were detected in the proportion of patients who achieved bacterial eradication between the two study arms: 62.16% of the patients who received FMT and 58.97% of those treated with ciprofloxacin (chi-square, p=0.78). The proportion of patients who achieved clinical cure was also similar (86.49% for FMT and 82.05% for ciprofloxacin; square, p=0.59). These results indicate similar efficacy of both antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated lower tract urinary infection in post-menopausal women. In regards to safety data, the proportion of global adverse effects associated to the treatments was 3.45% for FMT and 9.09% for ciprofloxacin. Treatment compliance was 100% for FMT and 83.64% for ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The FMT administered at a dose of 3g every 72hours (2 total doses) and ciprofloxacin at a dose of 250mg every 12hours during 3 days (6 total doses) have a comparable efficacy profile in lower tract urinary infection in post-menopausal women who adequately comply with the treatment, also having comparable safety. The FMT has a better antimicrobial susceptibility profile and better rate of treatment compliance.
TI  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis in a patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening  infection that is seen most commonly in persons with diabetes. The infecting organisms usually consist of mixed flora, including Escherichia coli (68%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and Proteus mirabilis. Females are affected twice as often as men, and mortality rates can be as high as 80%. Obstructive uropathy, urinary calculi, calyceal stenosis and neoplasms are significant predisposing factors. We report a case of EPN in a patient with the human immunodeficiency virus infection, without diabetes mellitus or urinary tract obstruction, which responded remarkably to conservative management with antibiotics alone.
TI  - Expression of the DisA amino acid decarboxylase from Proteus mirabilis inhibits motility and class 2 flagellar gene expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In Proteus mirabilis, a putative phenylalanine decarboxylase (DisA) acts in a regulatory pathway to inhibit class 2 flagellar gene expression and motility. In this study, we demonstrate that DisA expression in Escherichia coli blocked motility and resulted in a 50-fold decrease in the expression of class 2 (fliA) and class 3 (fliC) flagellar genes. However, the expression of flhDC encoding the class 1 activator of the flagellar cascade was unchanged by DisA expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Phenethylamine, a decarboxylation product derived from phenylalanine, was able to mimic DisA overexpression and decrease both motility and class 2/3 flagellar gene expression. In addition, both DisA overexpression and phenethylamine strongly inhibited biofilm formation in E. coli. DisA overexpression and exogenous phenethylamine could also reduce motility in other enteric bacteria, but had no effect on motility in non-enteric Gram-negative bacteria. It is hypothesized that phenethylamine or a closely related compound formed by the DisA decarboxylation reaction inhibits the formation or activity of the FlhD(4)C(2) complex required for activation of class 2 genes.
TI  - Prevalence and molecular epidemiology of acquired AmpC beta-lactamases and carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from 35 hospitals in Spain.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) and carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae collected from 35 hospitals in Spain and to establish their epidemiological relationships. We conducted a prospective multi-centre study on pAmpC- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical samples collected from February to July 2009. The strains suspected to carry pAmpC were resistant or showed intermediate susceptibility to co-amoxiclav and second- or third-generation cephalosporins. Strains suspected to carry a carbapenemase were selected because they showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to imipenem >1 mg/L. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a sequencing strategy were used to characterise the enzymes. The clonal relationships between isolates was analysed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Among 100,132 Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected, 1,654 were compatible with the production of pAmpC or carbapenemases. We found a prevalence of 0.64 % of pAmpC (n = 635) and 0.04 % of carbapenemases (n = 43). The most prevalent pAmpC enzymes were CMY-type (78.3 %), DHA-type (19.5 %), ACC-type (1.6 %) and FOX-type (0.6 %). The CMY-type was the most frequent in Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis species, whereas the DHA-type was mainly found in Klebsiella spp. The enzymes involved in carbapenem resistance were VIM-1, IMP-22 and the new IMP-28. Nine new bla genes were described: bla (CMY-54), bla (CMY-55), bla (CMY-56), bla (CMY-57), bla (CMY-96), bla (DHA-6), bla (DHA-7), bla (FOX-8) and bla (IMP-28). The prevalence of pAmpC or carbapenemases found is not negligible. The CMY-types were the predominant pAmpC, whereas the VIM or IMP enzymes were the predominant carbapenemases. Furthermore, we observed a great genetic diversity among pAmpC-producing strains and a close clonal relationship between carbapenemase-producing strains.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bioactive compounds and leaf extracts in Jatropha tanjorensis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jatropha tanjorensis was investigated scientifically to generate evidence for the efficacies reported in traditional systems and the results are given here. METHODS: Different concentrations of the solvent extracts of leaves and four isolated compounds were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, gram-negative bacteria of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Vibrio alcaligenes, Vibrio cholerae and fungi of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum by agar-well diffusion and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: In agar-well diffusion method, maximum activity was recorded in a concentration-dependent manner. The extracts recorded activity against bacteria such as 17-26, 15-25 and 13-24 mm to methanol extract and 15-24, 14-23 and 12-22 mm to chloroform extract at 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively and fungi such as 9-15 mm to A. fumigatus and 5-16 mm to T. rubrum. Maximum activity was 30-46, 27-43 and 17-40 mm to friedelin and 23-46, 28-44 and 18-41 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against bacteria and 12-37, 8-34 and 31-33 mm to friedelin and 12-40, 11-35 and 10-33 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against fungi at 10, 5 and 2.5mg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that friedelin, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone present in the methanol extract could be responsible for the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and provide scientific evidence.
TI  - Epidemiology and genetic characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections in long-term care facilities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess risk factors for acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (ESBL+ GN) causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). METHODS: A prospective case-case-control study was carried out. In the first study, cases were defined as patients harbouring ESBL+ GN, while, in the second study, cases were defined as patients harbouring ESBL-negative (ESBL-) GN. Controls were selected by simple random sampling from patients without GN infection. ESBL determinants were characterized by hybridization, and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: The study involved 297 LTCF patients (99 with ESBL+ GN UTI, 99 with ESBL- GN UTI and 99 without GN infection). ESBL+ GN UTIs were due to Escherichia coli (64%), Proteus mirabilis (25%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%). The CTX-M-type enzymes were the most prevalent (73% of isolates), whereas TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs and AmpC-type enzymes were less prevalent (10%, 2% and 15% of isolates, respectively). Patients with ESBL+ GN UTI were more likely to have a permanent urinary catheter (OR 15, 95% CI 6.9-30.5) and to have received antimicrobial therapy in the previous 30 days (OR 4, 95% CI 1.2-10.9). After adjusting for type, dosage and duration of antibiotic, exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins was associated with the highest risk of ESBL+ GN UTI development (OR 7, 95% CI 1.2-40). Independent risk factors for acquiring ESBL- GN UTIs were previous surgical procedures (OR 2, 95% CI 1.1-4) and the presence of a urinary catheter (OR 8, 95% CI 4-16). No specific antibiotics remained a significant risk for ESBL- GN UTI after adjusting for demographic and clinical risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins significantly increases the risk of ESBL+ GN UTI. Interventions aimed at improving compliance with antimicrobial stewardship principles should be further developed and implemented in LTCFs.
TI  - A conformational switch in a partially unwound helix selectively determines the pathway for substrate release from the carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT.
AB  - CaiT is a homotrimeric antiporter that exchanges l-carnitine (CRN) with gamma-butyrobetaine (GBB) across the bacterial membrane. Three structures have been resolved to date for CaiT, all in the inward-facing state: CRN-bound (with four CRNs per subunit), GBB-bound (two GBBs per subunit), and apo. One of the reported binding sites is the counterpart of the primary site observed in structurally similar transporters. However, the mechanism and pathway(s) of CRN/GBB unbinding and translocation, or even the ability of the substrates to dislodge from the reported binding sites, are yet to be determined. To shed light on these issues, we performed a total of 1.3 mus of molecular dynamics simulations and examined the dynamics of substrate-bound CaiT structures under different conditions. We find that both CRN and GBB are able to dissociate completely from their primary site into the cytoplasm. Substrate molecules initially located at the secondary sites dissociate even faster (within tens of nanoseconds) into the extra- or intracellular regions. Interestingly, the unbinding pathway from the primary site appears to be dictated by the geometry of the unwound part of the transmembrane (TM) helix 3, mostly around Thr(100) therein. Arg(262) on TM7, which apparently mimics the role of Na(+) in CaiT structural homologues, plays a key role in triggering the dissociation of the substrate away from the primary site and guiding its release to the cytoplasm provided that the unwound part of TM3 switches from a shielding to a yielding pose.
TI  - Standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  - PURPOSE: Isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (UTP). However, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. An important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. In this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common UTP. METHODS: A microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. Detection was accomplished, and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees C by measuring metabolic heat flow (muW = muJ/s) as a function of time. The strains were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULT: Bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 CFU. The gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. The growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for E. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for E. faecalis, 1.31 +/- 0.04 for P. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for S. aureus. The shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. CONCLUSIONS: IMC allows rapid detection of UTP in artificial urine. Clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. UTP detection after only 4 h is realistic. The rapid detection of UTP tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of IMC and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - Incidence and risk factors for infection in oral cancer patients undergoing different treatments protocols.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in cancer treatments have been counterbalanced by a rising number of immunosuppressed patients with a multitude of new risk factors for infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine risk factors, infectious pathogens in blood and oral cavity of oral cancer patients undergoing different treatment procedures. METHODS: The present prospective cohort analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2007 to October 2009. Total 186 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity were analyzed in the study. Based on treatment procedures patients were divided into three groups, group I were under radiotherapy, group II under chemotherapy and group III were of radio chemotherapy together. Clinical isolates from blood and oral cavity were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus. The predominant gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia were isolated from blood of radiotherapy and oral cavity of chemotherapy treated cases respectively. The predominance of gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were observed in blood of chemotherapy, radio chemotherapy cases and oral cavity of radiotherapy, radio chemotherapy treated cases. Our study also revealed the presence of C. albicans fungi as most significant oral cavity pathogens in radiotherapy and radio chemotherapy cases. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative were reported from the blood of all the three groups of patients. Oral mucositis played a significant role in oral cavity infection and make patients more prone to C. albicans infection.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection in tertiary care hospital of eastern Nepal.
AB  - Emergence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates has important clinical and therapeutic implications. A high prevalence of ESBL production among multidrug resistant gram negative isolates has been reported in literature from various clinical samples. Since ESBL detection is not done on a routine basis, its prevalence is not known till date. Thus the present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ESBL production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection. A total of 300 gram negative bacilli isolated from the pus samples were identified phenotypically and antimicrobial activity was determined. ESBL detection among the isolated organisms was done by Phenotypic confirmatory disc diffusion technique recommended by CLSI. Of the 300 isolates, majority were Escherichia coli; (107) followed by Acinetobacter species; (55), Pseudomonas species; (44), Klebsiella pneumoniae; (32), Proteus mirabilis; (26), Enterobacter species; (25), Citrobacter species; (9) and others; (2). The prevalence of ESBL producing organisms was found to be 54 (18%); amongst which Escherichia coli was 29 (53.7%), Klebsiella pneumonia (14.8%), Proteus mirabilis 7 (12.9%) and others 4 (7.4%). Multidrug resistance were found in 92.6% of ESBL producers. Forty two were resistant to all the three third generation cephalosporins. The continuous surveillance of the ESBL producing isolates is necessary to make aware about the correct treatment regimens and good infection control practices.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2008. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.8% of Escherichia coli, 2.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of Klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of Proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of Proteus vulgaris. ESBL produced strains were 6.8% at K. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at P. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. Among Haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. Although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL and doripenem showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL against P. aeruginosa have potent activity. Of all P. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
TI  - Early strains of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky sequence type 198 from Southeast Asia harbor Salmonella genomic island 1-J variants with a novel insertion sequence.
AB  - Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a 43-kb integrative mobilizable element that harbors a great diversity of multidrug resistance gene clusters described in numerous Salmonella enterica serovars and also in Proteus mirabilis. The majority of SGI1 variants contain an In104-derivative complex class 1 integron inserted between resolvase gene res and open reading frame (ORF) S044 in SGI1. Recently, the international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. enterica serovar Kentucky sequence type 198 (ST198) containing SGI1-K variants has been reported. A retrospective study was undertaken to characterize ST198 S. Kentucky strains isolated before the spread of the epidemic ST198-SGI1-K population in Africa and the Middle East. Here, we characterized 12 ST198 S. Kentucky strains isolated between 1969 and 1999, mainly from humans returning from Southeast Asia (n = 10 strains) or Israel (n = 1 strain) or from meat in Egypt (n = 1 strain). All these ST198 S. Kentucky strains did not belong to the XbaI pulsotype X1 associated with the African epidemic clone but to pulsotype X2. SGI1-J subgroup variants containing different complex integrons with a partial transposition module and inserted within ORF S023 of SGI1 were detected in six strains. The SGI1-J4 variant containing a partially deleted class 1 integron and thus showing a narrow resistance phenotype to sulfonamides was identified in two epidemiologically unrelated strains from Indonesia. The four remaining strains harbored a novel SGI1-J variant, named SGI1-J6, which contained aadA2, floR2, tetR(G)-tetA(G), and sul1 resistance genes within its complex integron. Moreover, in all these S. Kentucky isolates, a novel insertion sequence related to the IS630 family and named ISSen5 was found inserted upstream of the SGI1 complex integron in ORF S023. Thus, two subpopulations of S. Kentucky ST198 independently and exclusively acquired the SGI1 during the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike the ST198-X1 African epidemic subpopulation, the ST198-X2 subpopulation mainly from Asia harbors variants of the SGI1-J subgroup that are encountered mainly in the Far East, as previously described for S. enterica serovars Emek and Virchow.
TI  - Changing antibiotic susceptibilities of community-acquired uropathogens in Greece, 2005-2010.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and changes  in the antibiotic susceptibilities of uropathogens isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs) in Crete, Greece, over a 6-year period. METHODS: This study was performed with isolates from outpatients with UTIs, collected between 2005 and 2010. Isolates were identified by standard methods and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method and the VITEK2 is an automated system used for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms (BioMerieux). To identify changes in susceptibility patterns, we compared results of the period 2005-2007 to those of the period 2008-2010. We also compared the antibiotic susceptibilities of isolates between males and females. RESULTS: A total of 4011 community-acquired uropathogens were isolated during the period of 2005-2010. Escherichia coli was the most common organism and responsible for 68.9% of CA-UTIs, followed by Proteus mirabilis (6.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%) and enterococci (6%). A significant increase in resistance of E coli isolates was noted for beta-lactams, monobactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cotrimoxazole. The reverse trend was evident for nitrofurantoin. Higher resistance rates of community-acquired E coli and non-E coli Enterobacteriaceae were noted in males for ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. No significant sex differences were noted in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of enterococci. CONCLUSION: There is a concerning trend for increasing resistance among E coli and non-E coli Enterobacteriaceae responsible for CA-UTIs in Crete in recent years likely due to the inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics, as a substitute for precise diagnostics and/or to increase the chances of therapeutic success.
TI  - Spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  - Microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. However, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in China. We conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (NI) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from January 2003 to December 2010. We studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. The number of NIs per 100 admissions was 10.9. The commonest isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and Candida (11.4%). The result indicated that the numbers of patients with Acinetobacter sp. infection increased (P=0.004), but with Proteus mirabilis infection decreased (P=0.004). The isolated Acinetobacter sp. and P. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost all antibiotics tested. Notably, more frequent Acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the P. aeruginosa and E. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Proteobacterial ArfA peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger RNAs.
AB  - The translation of non-stop mRNA (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. In eubacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes from non-stop mRNA in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. During rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. Escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the ArfA peptide. The E. coli arfA message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by RNase III to produce a non-stop transcript. Therefore, ArfA levels are controlled by tmRNA through ssrA-peptide tagging and proteolysis. Here, we examine whether ArfA homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by RNase III and tmRNA. We searched 431 arfA coding sequences for mRNA secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in their 3'-coding regions. The arfA hairpins from Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio fischeri, and Pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by RNase III as predicted, whereas the hairpin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mRNA. Each ArfA homologue is ssrA-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type E. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmRNA. Together, these findings show that ArfA synthesis from non-stop mRNA is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. This strategy ensures that ArfA homologues are only deployed when the tmRNA system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.
TI  - Type I and Type II mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (PS) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen ((1) O(2), produced via Type II mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (HO(.), produced via Type I mechanism). This study examined the relative contributions of (1) O(2) and HO(.) to APDT killing of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (HPF) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSG) were used to determine HO(.) and (1) O(2) produced by illumination of two PS: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (BB6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (PEI-ce6). Dimethylthiourea is a HO(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (NaN(3)) is a quencher of (1) O(2). Both APDT and killing by Fenton reaction (chemical generation of HO(.)) were carried out on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: Conjugate PEI-ce6 mainly produced (1) O(2) (quenched by NaN(3)), while BB6 produced HO(.) in addition to (1) O(2) when NaN(3) potentiated probe activation. NaN(3) also potentiated HPF activation by Fenton reagent. All bacteria were killed by Fenton reagent but Gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than Gram-negatives. NaN(3) potentiated Fenton-mediated killing of all bacteria. The ratio of APDT killing between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for BB6 and 25:1 for conjugate PEI-ce6. There was a NaN(3) dose-dependent inhibition of APDT killing using both PEI-ce6 and BB6 against Gram-negative bacteria while NaN(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Azidyl radicals may be formed from NaN(3) and HO(.). It may be that Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to HO(.) while Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) O(2). The differences in NaN(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of PS binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of NaN(3) into cell walls of bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary infections in Taiwan: results from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), 2006-2010.
AB  - We investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance among species of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in Taiwan during the period 2006-2010 as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART). During the study period, 1032 isolates of Gram-negative bacilli that had been collected from patients with hepatobiliary infections were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (n = 874, 84.7%) of isolates and Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (n = 323, 31.3%). There were significantly more E. coli (P = 0.001) and Proteus mirabilis (P = 0.031) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for less than 48 h and significantly more Serratia marcescens (P = 0.035) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.008) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for 48 h or longer. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens was low. The decline in susceptibility rates with time was remarkable for ceftazidime (P = 0.036), ciprofloxacin (P = 0.029), and levofloxacin (P = 0.018). The most effective antibiotics, i.e., those that were active against more than 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, were amikacin, cefepime, imipenem, ertapenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to anti-pseudomonal agents was greater than 80%. In this study, we found an overall increase in resistance to antimicrobial agents among Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in Taiwan. Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and updates of treatment guidelines are recommended to help achieve optimal therapy for patients with hepatobiliary infections.
TI  - Primary retroperitoneal abscess caused by Candida glabrata.
AB  - Clinically, retroperitoneal abscesses present insidiously and the diagnosis may be delayed. This, with inadequate drainage, may result in increased morbidity and mortality. Most cases result from a renal or gastrointestinal process, but in a small number of patients there is no identifiable source and the abscess is designated as "primary." Most retroperitoneal abscesses are polymicrobial, and cultures often reveal organisms such as Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus species, Peptostreptococcus, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species. Fungal causes appear to be very rare, and in this study, a case of a patient with primary Candida glabrata retroperitoneal abscess is reported.
TI  - [Stones associated with vesicovaginal fistulas].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features and treatment of a large stone associated with vesicovaginal fistula and analyze the contributing factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to July 2011, seven patients were operated on for a large stone wedged in the vesicovaginal at the Urology Andrology department of the University Hospital of Brazzaville. For each case, the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic aspects were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven of 89 patients operated on for vesicovaginal in 10 years had a large stone. The age of patients ranged from 35 to 63 years with an average of 44 years. The age of the fistula ranged from 3 to 33 years. History were six caesarean sections and one obstructed labor. The urine culture performed in six patients had identified both Escherichia Coli, five times, and Proteus mirabilis, one time. The calculus was extracted five times by the bladder and two times vaginally. The dimensions of the calculi ranged from 3 to 7 cm of large diameter. The suture concomitant fistula was performed with four cures and three failures cured by a second course. CONCLUSION: Vesicovaginal fistulas may be complicated by calculus. The contributing factors are foreign bodies and infection.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: in vitro susceptibility to fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility trends of community-acquired extended-spectrum beta-Iactamase (ESBL)-producing urinary isolates with particular reference to fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven hospitals across the United Arab Emirates participated in this study from June 2008 to March 2010. The antibiotic sensitivity of ESBL-producing uropathogens to a panel of antibiotics including tigecycline, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin was assessed. The Hyplex ESBL identification system (h-ES-ID) was used for genotypic identification. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-two ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were identified during the study period. Of these, 182 (62%) were urinary isolates and comprised of Escherichia coli: 149 (81.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae: 30 (16.5%) and Proteus mirabilis: 3 (1.6%). Of the 182 urinary isolates, 179 (98.3%) were from patients with community onset urinary tract infections. The h-ES-ID system identified 172 (94.5%) of the urinary isolates as CTX-M positive. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. Over half of the isolates showed resistance to gentamicin (98; 53.8%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (139; 76.4%) and ciprofloxacin (143; 78.6%). Sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin was 90 and 100%, respectively. Two CTX-M-positive K. pneumoniae isolates with tigecycline resistance (MIC >4 microg/ml) were identified. CONCLUSION: There is dissemination of CTX-M ESBL-producing urinary pathogens into the community. Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin were active against ESBL-positive uropathogens, and emergence of tigecycline resistance needs close monitoring.
TI  - Report: Studies on antibacterial activity of some traditional medicinal plants used in folk medicine.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of eight medicinal plants commonly used in folk medicine were  tested for their antibacterial activity against four Gram positive strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and six Gram negative strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis. Salmonella typhi para A, Salmonella typhi para B and Shigella dysenteriae) that were obtained from different pathological laboratories located in Karachi, Pakistan. Disc diffusion method was used to analyze antibacterial activity. Out of eight, five medicinal plants showed antibacterial activity against two or more than two microbial species. The most effective antimicrobial plant found to be Punica granatum followed by Curcuma zedoaria Rosc, Grewia asiatica L and Carissa carandas L, Curcuma caesia Roxb respectively. From these results, it is evident that medicinal plants could be used as a potential source of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of flavonoids of withania somnifera L.
AB  - In the present study antimicrobial activity of Withania somnifera L. Dunal (Solanaceae) has been evaluated against selected pathogens. Free and bound flavonoids of different parts (root, stem, leaf and fruit) of W. somnifera have been studied for their antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion assay against three Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli MTCC 46, Proteus mirabilis MTCC 3310 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 1934), one Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 3160) and three fungi (Candida albicans MTCC 183, Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277 and Aspergillus niger MTCC 282). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was evaluated through micro broth dilution method, while minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration was determined by sub culturing the relevant samples. C. albicans was found to be the most susceptible organism followed by S. aureus, P. mirabilis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Out of the tested organisms, A flavus and A. niger were observed to be resistant as none of the tested extracts showed activity against them. Total activity (TA) of extracts (ml/g) against each sensitive pathogens was also evaluated. Bound flavonoid extract of root showed best activity against C. albicans (IZ 30, MIC 0.039, MFC 0.039, respectively). However all the microorganisms were found to be sensitive against the extracts tested. Total activity of bound flavonoid extract of root was found to be same for E.coli, P. mirabilis, S. aureus and C. albicans (153.84 ml/g). Results of the present study reveal that extracts of W. somnifera showing great antimicrobial potential against test microorganisms may be exploited for future antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Evaluation of a double synergy differential test (DSDT) for differential detection of ESBL and AmpC-type beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - This work describes a simple and practical double synergy differential test (DSDT) that couples the detection of ESBLs and AmpC-type enzymes by means of a combo-disk approach using cefotaxime and ceftazidime as indicator substrates, and clavulanate and boronic acid as enzyme inhibitors. The DSDT was tested with a collection of 118 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains with different beta-lactamase profiles, and proved to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of ESBL and AmpC-producing isolates.
TI  - [Emergence of resistance to third generation cephalosporins by Enterobacteriaceae causing community-onset urinary tract infections in hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in the community, and a matter of concern due to the increasing resistance of microorganisms to first line antibiotics and the emergence of multiresistant strains producing extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) in the community. METHODS: An analytical case-control study was conducted over twelve months in 9 hospitals in Colombia. We collected isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. from patients with community-onset UTI. The presence of ESBL, AmpC and KPC beta-lactamases were characterized by microbiological and molecular methods. The aim of this study was to determine factors related to the presence of these mechanisms of the resistance to third generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: A total of 325 isolates (287 E. coli, 29 Klebsiella spp. and 9 Proteus spp.) were included. The most frequent comorbidities among the patients were hypertension (n=82; 25.2%) and diabetes mellitus (n=68; 20.9%). Previous use of antimicrobials was found in 23% of patients, and 29% had a previous UTI. Resistance to third and fourth generation cephalosporins varied between 3.4% and 6.3% in E. coli and between 6.9% and 17.8% in K. pneumoniae. Seven (2.4%) CTX-M-15 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected; four of them belonged to ST 131 clone. In K. pneumoniae we detected three KPC-3 carbapenemases (10.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the emergence of resistance to third generation cephalosporins enterobacteriaceae as a cause of community-onset UTI. We emphasize the presence of ST 131 clone and KPC carbapenemases circulating in Colombia outside the hospital environment.
TI  - Epidemiology and genetics of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - CTX-M enzymes, the plasmid-mediated cefotaximases, constitute a rapidly growing family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) with significant clinical impact. CTX-Ms are found in at least 26 bacterial species, particularly in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. At least 109 members in CTX-M family are identified and can be divided into seven clusters based on their phylogeny. CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-14 are the most dominant variants. Chromosome-encoded intrinsic cefotaximases in Kluyvera spp. are proposed to be the progenitors of CTX-Ms, while ISEcp1, ISCR1 and plasmid are closely associated with their mobilization and dissemination.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - [Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in non-inducible AmpC enterobacteria: evaluation of the new MIC breakpoints].
AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate the in vitro activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) in non-inducible AmpC enterobacteria thromicrogh phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the mechanisms of resistance (ESBL, plasmid-mediated AmpC and KPC) and to evaluate the interpretation criteria proposed by the existing recommendations and the new breakpoints established by the CLSI and the EUCAST. Susceptibility tests and PCR multiplex for b/aSHV and b/aCTX-M and amplification using specific primers was performed. One hundred sixty nine resistant isolates: K/ebsie//a pneumoniae (95), Escherichia co/i (55), and Proteus mirabi/is (19) were recovered. ESC resistance was 56.2 %, 32.6%, and 11.2 %, respectively. ESBL was detected in 152 (90 %) isolates, plasmid-mediated AmpC in 12 (7 %) and KPC in 5 (3 %). The CLSI 2009 recommendations and the breakpoints smicroggested by the CLSI 2010 and the EUCAST for ceftriaxone were efficacious to detect ESBL, whereas the different breakpoints for ceftazidime presented discrepancies. The CLSI 2010 breakpoints only detected 55 % of the ESBL-producing isolates due to the endemic presence of CTX-M ESBLs in our country. Regarding the plasmid-mediated AmpC producers, the recommendations of the CLSI 2010 and the EUCAST 2010 proved to be more efficient than the old ones.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and antibiotics.
AB  - Synergistic activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and commonly used antibiotics, amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, were evaluated. Interactions between plant extracts and antibiotics were tested by checkerboard method and interpreted as FIC index. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and clinical isolates Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were used. Salvia officinalis showed better synergistic capacity than Cichorium intybus. Synergistic interactions were observed between amoxicillin and acetone or ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis and between chloramphenicol and ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentration (1/4 MIC to 1/32 MIC) of sage extracts, the MIC values of antibiotics were decreased by 2- to 10-fold. Synergism was observed against all test bacteria, except Escherichia coli. The combinations of acetone and ethyl acetate extract from Cichorium intybus and antibiotics resulted in additive and indifferent effects against tested bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of major uropathogens in a single-pot multiplex PCR assay.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common bacterial infections and poses a significant healthcare burden. Escherichia coli is the most common cause of UTI accounting for up to 70 % and a variable contribution from Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To establish a complete diagnostic system, we have developed a single-tube multiplex PCR assay (mPCR) for the detection of the above-mentioned four major uropathogens. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be as low as 10(2) cfu/ml of cells. The mPCR evaluated on 280 clinical isolates detected 100 % of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis and 95 % of K. pneumonia. The assay was performed on 50 urine samples and found to be specific and sensitive for clinical diagnosis. In addition, the mPCR was also validated on spiked urine samples using 40 clinical isolates to demonstrate its application under different strain used in this assay. In total, mPCR reported here is a rapid and simple screening tool that can compete with conventional biochemical-based screening assays that may require 2-3 days for detection.
TI  - Identification and molecular characterisation of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1)- and NDM-6-producing Enterobacteriaceae from New Zealand hospitals.
AB  - The global spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) is of significant public health concern. This study sought to determine whether bla(NDM) was present in Enterobacteriaceae isolates displaying resistance to carbapenems that were submitted to the National Antibiotic Reference Laboratory, Institute of Environmental Science and Research (Porirua, New Zealand) during 2009 and 2010. Isolates were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase genes and 16S rRNA methylase genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Plasmid transfer studies were undertaken on isolates found to be harbouring bla(NDM). Molecular typing was performed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The bla(NDM-1) gene was identified in four Enterobacteriaceae isolates (two Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Proteus mirabilis) from four patients in New Zealand hospitals in 2009 and 2010. In addition, the bla(NDM-6) gene, which differed from bla(NDM-1) by a point mutation at position 698 (C-->T), was also identified in an E. coli isolate from the same patient who harboured the bla(NDM-1)-positive P. mirabilis. All four patients had recently been hospitalised or received health care in India. Four of the isolates also produced a CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase, and all five isolates harboured the plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylase rmtC gene. The E. coli types were diverse by MLST, and the K. pneumoniae isolate belonged to the internationally disseminated sequence type 11 (ST11) clone. These findings further illustrate the diversity of phenotypic and genotypic features found in association with bla(NDM), in addition to documenting the international spread of this resistance mechanism, notably into a country with historically low rates of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Globally dispersed mobile drug-resistance genes in gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in a US urban general hospital.
AB  - Mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. Over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (GNB) pathogens from the blood of inpatients at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. Of 376 GNB isolates, 167 (44 %) were Escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were Proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were Enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different GNB species. Among E. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). The most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfrA17-aadA5, found in 30 (25 %) of 119 drug-resistant E. coli isolates and in one isolate of Moraxella morganii. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes were found in 16 E. coli isolates (10 %). These genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream E. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. Thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by E. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.
TI  - [Diaper cystitis as recurrent cause of urinary infections in geriatric community  hospital].
AB  - AIM: Chronic cystitis in diaper-dependent elderly patients can be a causative pathology for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in community hospitals. METHODS: We analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from January 2007 to December 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. The reading causes of hospital infections were UTIs (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (CAP; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP; 17.2%). Of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, UTIs were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by CAP (n=809, 26%) and HAP (n=533, 17.2%). Of 278 UTIs in 2007, the causative strains were Escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), Enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), Proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (n=14, 13%) strains were noted in 106 patients with Escherichia coli. We then retrospectively examined the records of 110 diaper dependent elderly patients, (medical words, n=52, mix-care wards, n=68) for UTIs over the same study period. Of these 16 (14.5%) had no UTIs at any time, 12 (11%) were infected 50% of the time, 17 (15.5%) were infected 51% to 99% of the time and 65 (59%) were infected 100% of the time. The UTI rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. We treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. Antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. It remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients. The clinical dilemma of whether recurrent diaper cystitis should be treated and prohibit the growth and spread of drug-resistant strains, remains challenging.
TI  - Extensive characterizations of bacteria isolated from catheterized urine and stone matrices in patients with nephrolithiasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are generally known to be associated with nephrolithiasis, particularly struvite stone, in which the most common microbe found is urea-splitting bacterium, i.e. Proteus mirabilis. However, our observation indicated that it might not be the case of stone formers in Thailand. We therefore extensively characterized microorganisms associated with all types of kidney stones. METHODS: A total of 100 kidney stone formers (59 males and 41 females) admitted for elective percutaneous nephrolithotomy were recruited and microorganisms isolated from catheterized urine and cortex and nidus of their stones were analyzed. RESULTS: From 100 stone formers recruited, 36 cases had a total of 45 bacterial isolates cultivated from their catheterized urine and/or stone matrices. Among these 36 cases, chemical analysis by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy revealed that 8 had the previously classified 'infection-induced stones', whereas the other 28 cases had the previously classified 'metabolic stones'. Calcium oxalate (in either pure or mixed form) was the most common and found in 64 and 75% of the stone formers with and without bacterial isolates, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium (approximately one-third of all bacterial isolates) found in urine and stone matrices (both nidus and periphery). Linear regression analysis showed significant correlation (r = 0.860, P < 0.001) between bacterial types in urine and stone matrices. Multidrug resistance was frequently found in these isolated bacteria. Moreover, urea test revealed that only 31% were urea-splitting bacteria, whereas the majority (69%) had negative urea test. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that microorganisms are associated with almost all chemical types of kidney stones and urea-splitting bacteria are not the major causative microorganisms found in urine and stone matrices of the stone formers in Thailand. These data may lead to rethinking and a new roadmap for future research regarding the role of microorganisms in kidney stone formation.
TI  - Microbiological and mucociliary properties of the ethanol extract of Hymenocardia acida on selected respiratory clinical isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial property of the ethanol leaf extract of Hymenocardia acida (H.  acida) on some opportunistic respiratory pathogens was evaluated in this study. We also assessed the activity of the extract on tracheal mucociliary activity using murine tracheal mucus exudation and mucociliary motility in pigeons as experimental models. Phytochemical screening of the extract was done; and acute toxicity of the extract in mice was carried out using Lorke's method for estimation of its median lethal dose. Results show the presence of carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, and balsams in the extract and the absence of anthraquinones, terpenes, and sterols. Results of the acute toxicity test showed that the extract was slightly toxic, with an estimated median lethal dose of 1,767.77 mg/kg body weight. At 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of H. acida, tracheal mucus exudation was increased by 14.29, 19.24, and 33.82%, respectively. The effect on mucociliary velocity was dose-dependent as 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of the extract led to increased ciliary activity by 7.69, 61.5, and 81.6%, respectively. The effects of the extract (200 mg/kg body weight) on mucus exudation and clearance were significant (p < .05) and higher than the effect of ammonium chloride. Although the extract did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans and K. pneumoniae, it exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. These findings show the mucociliary activity and antimicrobial properties of H. acida ethanol extract, and justify its use in the treatment of airway disorders.
TI  - Epidemiology of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples in the Kinki Region of Japan.
AB  - In the present study, nonduplicate, clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Proteus mirabilis were collected during a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009 at several hospitals in the Kinki region, Japan. The detection rate of E coli markedly increased from 0.24% to 7.25%. The detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 0% to 2.44% and that of P mirabilis from 6.97% to 12.85%. The most frequently detected genotypes were the CTX-M9 group for E coli, the CTX-M2 group for K pneumoniae, and the CTX-M2 group for P mirabilis. E coli clone O25:H4-ST131 producing CTX-M-15, which is spreading worldwide, was first detected in 2007. The most common replicon type of E coli was the IncF type, particularly FIB, detected in 466 strains (69.7%). Of the K pneumoniae strains, 47 (55.3%) were of the IncN type; 77 P mirabilis strains (96.3%) were of the IncT type. In the future, the surveillance of various resistant bacteria, mainly ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, should be expanded to prevent their spread.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in Greece.
AB  - The reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. We retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of Enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. Susceptibility testing was done with the automated Vitek 2 system. The breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics were those proposed by the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM), the FDA, and the CLSI, respectively. A total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) Escherichia coli, 1,040 (16.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) Proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) Enterobacter sp. isolates. Excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 K. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). Regarding resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. Isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae species. It could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.
TI  - Discovery and characterization of Coturnix chinensis avian beta-defensin 10, with broad antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD), AvBD10, was discovered in the liver and bone  marrow tissues from Chinese painted quail (Coturnix chinensis) in the present study. The complete nucleotide sequence of quail AvBD10 contains a 207-bp open reading frame that encodes 68 amino acids. The quail AvBD10 was expressed widely in all the tissues from quails except the tongue, crop, breast muscle, and thymus and was highly expressed in the bone marrow. In contrast to the expression pattern of AvBD10 in tissues from quail, the chicken AvBD10 was expressed in all 21 tissues from the layer hens investigated, with a high level of expression in the kidney, lung, liver, bone marrow, and Harderian glands. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged AvBD10s of both quail and chicken were produced and purified by expression of the two cDNAs in Escherichia coli, respectively. In addition, peptide according to the respective AvBD10s sequence was synthesized, named synthetic AvBD10s. As expected, both recombinant GST-tagged AvBD10s and synthetic AvBD10s of quail and chicken exhibited similar bactericidal properties against most bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative forms. However, no significant bactericidal activity was found for quail recombinant GST-tagged AvBD10 against Salmonella choleraesuis or for chicken recombinant GST-tagged AvBD10 against Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. We enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. Similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). In symptomatic girls, the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). Bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly Proteus mirabilis (14.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and Escherichia coli (7.0%). The finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). Candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. The diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Danish clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: prevalence, beta-lactamase distribution, phylogroups, and co-resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most Gram-negative community-acquired and nosocomial infections are caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, among which increasing resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) is a major problem. We present data from the first Danish nationwide prevalence study on ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis in blood and urine cultures from hospitals and the community. METHODS: During September and October 2007, 13 of 15 Danish departments of clinical microbiology collected data and strains. Confirmatory ESBL test-positive isolates were sent to a central laboratory for species and ESBL-phenotype confirmation, extended susceptibility testing, phylogenetic grouping of E. coli strains, and ESBL gene characterization. RESULTS: During the study, blood samples from 18,259 patients and urine samples from 47,504 patients were subjected to culture. Among 14,674 cultured isolates, 352 were confirmed to be ESBL-producers. Thus, the crude ESBL prevalence was 2.4% (range 1.5% of E. coli in community urine to 6.6% of K. pneumoniae in hospital urine). An average of 7.2 ESBL-producers per 100,000 consumed bed-days was calculated. Of the 352 reported ESBL-producers, 205 E. coli, 73 K. pneumoniae, and 1 P. mirabilis, were available for testing. CTX-M enzymes dominated, both in hospitals and in the community, occurring in 92% of E. coli and 88% of K. pneumoniae, and with CTX-M-15 constituting 60% and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 2003 data the ESBL prevalence in Denmark has increased significantly. In the ESBL-producers, reduced susceptibility towards both gentamicin and ciprofloxacin was seen among 43% E. coli and 55% K. pneumoniae, leaving clinicians in these cases with only a carbapenem for the treatment of serious infections. Part of this study was presented at the 20(th) European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, abstract P-1617.
TI  - Current studies on bacterospermia the leading cause of male infertility: a protege and potential threat towards mans extinction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current rise of male infertility associated with bacterospermia and urogenital infection has been on the increase amongst adult married males in Benin metropolis and a major cause of concern to male fertility and reproduction in Nigeria. AIM: To microbiologically isolate and study the infectious agent that has led to male infertility and also to study the percentage occurrence of bacteropsermia and urogenital caused infertility in adult married males in Benin metropolis MATERIAL AND METHOD: using standard microbiological methods of isolating and identifying the organism, specimen was collected and processed which includes the susceptibility profile of isolates and sperm quality. In this study a total of 140 sperm samples was collected from patient who were referred from the consultant outpatient department of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital and then evaluated bacteriologically using standard bacterial cultural methods RESULTS: Among the total cases, 92 (65.7%) showed at least one pathogen. Staphylococcus aureus (28.3%), Staphylococcus Saprophyticus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aerouginosa (6.5%), Escherichia Coli (19.6%) Proteus mirabilis (10.8%) Klebsiella spp (10.8%) and Proteus vulgaris (10.8%). CONCLUSION: There was an outstanding significant relationship between bacteriospermia and the rate of total motility and morphologically abnormal sperms, The percentage of morphologically normal sperm was lower in this study. Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus saprohyticus and Escherichia coli were the most common pathogen having negative effects on sperm motility and morphology in this study.
TI  - Antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin II secreted by the Arctic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudofactin II is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. Pseudofactin II is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino acid in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr3. Adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. Adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. In this study the role and applications of pseudofactin II as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. RESULTS: Pseudofactin II lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and two Candida albicans strains. Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of C. albicans by 92-99%. The same concentration of pseudofactin II dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. Pseudofactin II also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of E. faecalis, E. coli, E. hirae and C. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. The highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of S. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of C. albicans growth. CONCLUSION: Pseudofactin II showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. Up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II. In addition, pseudofactin II dispersed preformed biofilms. Pseudofactin II can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.
TI  - Emergence of Proteus mirabilis harboring blaKPC-2 and qnrD in a Chinese Hospital.
AB  - Nineteen carbapenem-nonsusceptible Proteus mirabilis isolates were recovered from intensive care units in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University during a 3-month period. The isolates showed a high level of resistance against ciprofloxacin, in addition to their resistance against the carbapenems. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that these isolates belonged to three clonal strains. PCRs and DNA sequence analysis of the carbapenemase and other beta-lactamase genes indicated that all the isolates harbored the bla(KPC-2) gene. Twelve of 19 isolates harbored the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, both the qnrD and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes. Eight representative isolates with high levels of quinolone resistance carried the similar mutation profiles of S83I in gyrA, E466D in gyrB, and S80I in parC. Reduced carbapenem susceptibility was transferred to Escherichia coli (EC600) in a conjugation experiment, while the quinolone resistance was not. DNA hybridization showed that qnrD was located on a plasmid of approximately 4.5 kb. In summary, large clonally related isolates of KPC-2-producing P. mirabilis emerged in a Chinese hospital, and qnrD was detected in KPC-producing P. mirabilis for the first time.
TI  - Using nucleic acid microarrays to perform molecular epidemiology and detect novel beta-lactamases: a snapshot of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases throughout the world.
AB  - The worldwide dissemination of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a major concern in both hospital and community settings. Rapid identification of these resistant pathogens and the genetic determinants they possess is needed to assist in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. A collection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis isolates, including phenotypically ESBL-positive (n = 1,093) and ESBL-negative isolates (n = 59), obtained in 2008-2009 from a longitudinal surveillance study (SMART) was examined using an in vitro nucleic acid-based microarray. This approach was used to detect and identify bla(ESBL) (bla(SHV), bla(TEM), and bla(CTX-M) genes of groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) and bla(KPC) genes and was combined with selective PCR amplification and DNA sequencing for complete characterization of the bla(ESBL) and bla(KPC) genes. Of the 1,093 phenotypically ESBL-positive isolates, 1,041 were identified as possessing at least one bla(ESBL) gene (95.2% concordance), and 59 phenotypically ESBL-negative isolates, used as negative controls, were negative. Several ESBL variants of bla(TEM) (n = 5), bla(SHV) (n = 11), bla(CTX-M) (n = 19), and bla(KPC) (n = 3) were detected. A new bla(SHV) variant, bla(SHV-129), and a new bla(KPC) variant, bla(KPC-11), were also identified. The most common bla genes found in this study were bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-14), and bla(SHV-12). Using nucleic acid microarrays, we obtained a "molecular snapshot" of bla(ESBL) genes in a current global population; we report that CTX-M-15 is still the dominant ESBL and provide the first report of the new beta-lactamase variants bla(SHV-129) and bla(KPC-11).
TI  - Rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. In addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. The study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. IMC is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. Detection was accomplished, and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees C by measuring metabolic heat flow (microW = microJ/s) as a function of time. The strains were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. The detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL for E. coli, 10 CFU/mL for P. mirabilis and E. faecalis and 10(3) CFU/mL for S. aureus. The total heat was highest in P. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 J, followed by E. coli (3-4 J), S. aureus (2-3 J) and E. faecalis (1.3-1.5 J). The shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. CONCLUSIONS: IMC allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. Urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. Clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. Due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) CFU/mL), IMC may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.
TI  - Broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h NMR  spectroscopy.
AB  - To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (UTI), we applied (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. Study includes 682 urine samples from suspected UTI patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (GNB) (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (GPC) (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus). Acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine (TMA), citrate, trimethylamin-N-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. All urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. Multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) reveals that acetate, lactate, succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from UTI patients. This statistical analysis was also able to classify GNB to GPC infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). This technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing GNB and GPC infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. The determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of UTI patients.
TI  - [Epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Iasi, Romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  - Infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 at The Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). Cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. RESULTS: From 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. Severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high Charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). There were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated, being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci (14/18,66%), Enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group B Streptococcus (3/4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus equi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). Multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. Meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of S. aureus. Among 16 invazive strains of E. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. There were no E. coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. The mean mortality rate was 14,66%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance of S. aureus and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. Proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae, recommending ESBL confirmation with Etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive ESBL screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime MIC >1 mg/L or an automated system ESBL warning). Twenty laboratories submitted 443 Enterobacteriaceae with a positive ESBL screen test and their confirmation test result (74%Escherichia coli, 12%Enterobacter cloacae, 8%Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%Proteus mirabilis, 2%Klebsiella oxytoca). Presence of ESBL genes was used as reference test. Accuracy of local phenotypic ESBL detection was 88%. The positive predictive value (PPV) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (Vitek-2: 69%, Phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%K. pneumoniae-27%K. oxytoca). A low PPV (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin MICs <2 mg/L. Local ESBL confirmation had a PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93% and 90%, respectively. Compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. Combination disc was more specific than Etest (91% versus 61%). Confirmation tests were not reliable for P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca (PPV 33% and 38%, respectively, although NPVs were 100%). In conclusion, performance of Etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic ESBL confirmation of P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic ESBL confirmation, and by interpreting isolates with a positive ESBL alarm but an MIC <2 mg/L for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as ESBL-negative.
TI  - French results of the ARESC study: clinical aspects and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in female patients with cystitis. Implications for empiric therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most frequent community infections. We report the French results of the international ARESC study on the clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. PATIENT AND METHODS: Female patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis, were investigated clinically with urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested with nine antimicrobials. RESULTS: Four thousand and four hundred patients were included, 871 in France, forming the largest national cohort. Urine culture was positive (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) in 550 (63.1%); 533 (96.9%) presented with a single bacterium infection. 488 uropathogens, collected from 479 patients, were analyzed. The most frequent were: Escherichia coli (83.8%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (3.1%), enterococci (1.2%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.0%). E. coli was highly susceptible to fosfomycin (99.0%) (97.1%), nitrofurantoin (97.3%), and ciprofloxacin (98.3%). The lowest susceptibility rates were found for ampicillin (60.9%) and cotrimoxazole (87.8%). Fosfomycin (97.8%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), and nitrofurantoin (91.5%) had the highest susceptibility rate. The lowest susceptibility rates were observed with ampicillin (61.4%) and cotrimoxazole (86.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Fosfomycin, pivmecillinam (not available in France), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) and fluoroquinolones are not usually recommended as first intention drugs for the empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis, because of increasing resistance rates.
TI  - Antiquorum sensing and antibiofilm potential of Capparis spinosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens often leads to the failure of existing antibiotics to treat bacterial infections; thus, there is a need to seek alternative treatment measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) and antibiofilm potential of Capparis spinosa to prevent the onset of bacterial infections as an alternate to antibiotics. METHODS: The methanolic extract of the dried fruits of C. spinosa was assessed for its activity in inhibiting QS-depedent phenomenon such as violacein pigment production in Chromobacterium violaceum, biosurfactant production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, swimming and swarming motility, exopolysaccharide production (EPS) and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and PAO1. RESULTS: Extract of C. spinosa showed a higher degree of anti-QS activity in a dose dependent manner without affecting the bacterial growth. At 2 mg/mL, this extract significantly (p </=0.005) inhibited the biofilm formation to 79, 75, 73, 70% and EPS production to 58, 46, 66 and 67% in S. marcescens, PAO1, E. coli and P. mirabilis, respectively. It also exhibited inhibition in swimming and swarming motility of bacterial pathogens. The non-enzymatic nature of the anti-QS compound in C. spinosa was confirmed by proteinase K and heat treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because the methanolic extract of C. spinosa demonstrated anti-QS and antibiofilm activity at 0.5-2 mg/mL, it could be further exploited for novel molecules to treat the emerging infections of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections in South African hospitals (SMART Study 2004-2009): impact of the new carbapenem breakpoints.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) follows trends in resistance among aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) in patients around the world. METHODS: During 2004-2009, three centralized clinical microbiology laboratories serving 59 private hospitals in three large South African cities collected 1,218 GNB from complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) and tested them for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics according to the 2011 Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae comprised 83.7% of the isolates. Escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (46.4%), and 7.6% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. The highest ESBL rate was documented for Klebsiella pneumoniae (41.2%). Overall, ertapenem was the antibiotic most active against susceptible species for which it has breakpoints (94.6%) followed by amikacin (91.9%), piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3%), and imipenem-cilastatin (87.1%), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7%, 28.7%, 22.5%, and 21.1%, respectively. Multi-drug resistance (MDR), defined as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes, was significantly more common in K. pneumoniae (27.9%) than in E. coli (4.9%; p<0.0001) or Proteus mirabilis (4.1%; p<0.05). Applying the new CLSI breakpoints for carbapenems, susceptibility to ertapenem was reduced significantly in ESBL-positive E. coli compared with ESBL-negative isolates (91% vs. 98%; p<0.05), but this did not apply to imipenem-cilastatin (95% vs. 99%; p=0.0928). A large disparity between imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem susceptibility in P. mirabilis and Morganella morganii was documented (24% vs. 96% and 15% vs. 92%, respectively), as most isolates of these two species had imipenem-cilastatin minimum inhibitory concentrations in the 2-4 mcg/mL range, which is no longer regarded as susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented substantial resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy among GNB commonly isolated from cIAIs in South Africa. With the application of the new CLSI carbapenem breakpoints, discrepancies were noted between ertapenem and imipenem-cilastatin with regard to the changes in their individual susceptibilities. Longitudinal surveillance of susceptibility patterns is useful to guide recommendations for empiric antibiotic use in cIAIs.
TI  - Radial and spiral stream formation in Proteus mirabilis colonies.
AB  - The enteric bacterium Proteus mirabilis, which is a pathogen that forms biofilms  in vivo, can swarm over hard surfaces and form a variety of spatial patterns in colonies. Colony formation involves two distinct cell types: swarmer cells that dominate near the surface and the leading edge, and swimmer cells that prefer a less viscous medium, but the mechanisms underlying pattern formation are not understood. New experimental investigations reported here show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams, in addition to previously-reported concentric rings. These new observations suggest that swimmers are motile and that indirect interactions between them are essential in the pattern formation. To explain these observations we develop a hybrid model comprising cell-based and continuum components that incorporates a chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce. The model predicts that formation of radial streams can be explained as the modulation of the local attractant concentration by the cells, and that the chirality of the spiral streams results from a swimming bias of the cells near the surface of the substrate. The spatial patterns generated from the model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.
TI  - [Characteristic of fluoroquinolone resistant clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae,  P. mirabilis and E. coli producing ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are the predominant mechanism for acquired antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. During the past few years, increasing occurrence of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpCs) particularly in K. pneumonia, P. mirabilis and E. coli was reported. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse of the diversity of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as pAmpCs and ESBLs among clinical K. pneumonia, P. mirabilis and E. coli strains in Poland. METHODS: A total of 19 clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains (E. coli, n = 9; K. pneumoniae, n = 7; P. mirabilis, n = 3) resistant to third-generation cephalosporin were selected from collection of fluoroquinolone resistant isolates recovered during a 6-months period in regular hospital in Warsaw, Poland. ESBLs and AmpCs were detected by using phenotypic methods: double-disc tests (DDSTs), MAST ID D68C test, sensitivity to cefoxitin, disk potentiation test (DPT) and Tris-EDTA test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the bla(AmpC), bla(CTM-M), bla(TEM), and bla(SHV), genes. PCR-products for these genes were sequenced. To determine the possible clonality of the tested isolates PFGE with the XbaI was performed. RESULTS: Nine of 19 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains tested produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of TEM, SHV and CTX-M families. These ESBLs were most commonly detected in E. coli. AmpC beta-lactamases were produced by 6 tested strains, including 3 isolates of P. mirabilis. The AmpC found in our study belonged to CMY and DHA families, Furthermore, 4 isolates of K. pneumoniae were found to co-produce both ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. XbaI-PFGE profiles pointed significant differences of tested strains. CONCLUSION: Horizontal transfer of genes encoding for acquired beta-lactamases such ESBL and AmpC seem to play primary role in dissemination of these resistance traits among fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae in Poland.
TI  - Influence of quorum sensing signal molecules on biofilm formation in Proteus mirabilis O18.
AB  - The influence of basis of quorum sensing molecules on Proteus strains is much less known as compared to Pseudomonas or Escherichia. We have previously shown that a series of acylated homoserine lactones (acyl-HSL) does not influence the ureolytic, proteolytic, or hemolytic abilities, and that the swarming motility of Proteus mirabilis rods is strain specific. The aim of the presented study was to find out if the presence of a series of acyl-HSL influences biofilm formation of P. mirabilis laboratory strain belonging to O18 serogroup. This serogroup is characterized by the presence of a unique non-carbohydrate component, namely phosphocholine. Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis O18 strains used in this work contains cloned plasmids encoding fluorescent protein genes with constitutive gene expression. In mixed biofilms in stationary and continuous flow conditions, P. mirabilis O18 overgrow whole culture. P. mirabilis O18 strain has genetically proved a presence of AI-2 quorum sensing system. Differences in biofilm structure were observed depending on the biofilm type and culture methods. From tested acylated homoserine lactones (BHL, HHL, OHL, DHL, dDHL, tDHL), a significant influence had BHL on thickness, structure, and the amount of exopolysaccharides produced by biofilms formed by P. mirabilis O18 pDsRed(2).
TI  - A self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  - This article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against bacteria. The microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of PDMS containing channels that connect the chambers. The assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by PDMS provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. During the operation of the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. The growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a pH indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. Using this device we measured the MIC of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Proteus mirabilis HI4320, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli MG1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. The device provides a simple method for MIC determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. Importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. As the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the SMART study in Spain (2002-2010).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the SMART study performed in Spain from 2002 to 2010. Isolates were recovered in 16 centres. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). Frequency of ESBL-producing isolates was: E. coli, 8.7%; K. pneumoniae, 8.4%; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and Proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. Overall, ESBL-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). Ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with EUCAST criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all Enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against ESBL producers (95.5-100%). Susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among ESBL-producing isolates. Nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in ESBL-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial susceptibility data from the SMART-Spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. This is also supported by the high frequency of ESBL-producers in our geographic area.
TI  - Frequency of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae among  urinary pathogen isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)  producing Enterobacteriaceae in urinary isolates. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Ziauddin University Hospital, Karachi, from February to October 2008. METHODOLOGY: All members of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from urinary samples of in-patients were included and identified using standard biochemical tests. Urinary samples from out-patients were excluded. Detection of ESBL was carried out by double disk diffusion technique. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS version 10. RESULTS: A total of 289 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were identified during the study period. Of those 190/289 (65.7%) of the isolates were found to be ESBL producing. ESBL positivity within individual organism group was highest in Klebsiella species 84.16%, followed by Escherichia coli 68.55%, Enterobacter species 36.84%, and Proteus mirabilis 28.55%. Mean age of patients with ESBL producing organisms was 58.69 +/- 18.97 years. ESBL production was almost similar in all age groups. CONCLUSION: A high frequency of ESBL producing organisms especially Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli amongst the hospital obtained urinary isolates was documented particularly in the older age group. The data points towards an urgent need for regular screening and surveillance for ESBL producing organisms in this region.
TI  - Colonisation and infection due to Enterobacteriaceae producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of infections caused by Enterobacteria producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpC), which are emerging as a cause of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. METHODS: A prospective multicentre cohort of patients with infection/colonisation due to pAmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae was performed in 7 Spanish hospitals from February throughout July 2009. pAmpCs were characterised by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: 140 patients were included; organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (n = 100), Proteus mirabilis (n = 20), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 17), and others (n = 3). Overall, 90% had a chronic underlying condition. The acquisition was nosocomial in 43%, healthcare-associated in 41% (14% of those were nursing home residents), and community in 16%. Only 5% of patients had no predisposing feature for infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Nineteen percent of patients were bacteraemic. Inappropriate empirical therapy was administered to 81% of bacteraemic patients, who had a crude mortality rate of 48%. The most frequent enzyme was CMY-2 (70%, predominantly in E. coli and P. mirabilis) followed by DHA-1 (19%, predominantly in K. pneumoniae). CONCLUSION: pAmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae caused nosocomial, healthcare-associated and community infections mainly in predisposed patients. Invasive infections were associated with high mortality which might be partly related to inappropriate empirical therapy.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated transfer of the bla(NDM-1) gene in Gram-negative rods.
AB  - The latest threat of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in Enterobacteriacae. Five bla(NDM) (-1) -positive plasmids of different incompatibility groups (IncL/M, FII, A/C and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. Successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. Conjugation frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. Higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees C compared with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees C. Carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. None of the five plasmids was transferable to Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. This work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(NDM) (-1) gene could be among Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Control of Clinical Pathogens by the Haemolymph of Paratelphusa hydrodromous, a Freshwater Crab.
AB  - In the present study, effort has been made to find the antimicrobial activity of  haemolymph collected from freshwater crab, Paratelphusa hydrodromous. The haemolymph collected was tested for antimicrobial assay by disc diffusion method against clinical pathogens. Five bacterial species, namely, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and five fungal strains, namely and Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus sp., and Mucor sp., were selected for the study. The result shows a strong response of haemolymph against the clinical pathogens which confirms the immune mechanism of the freshwater crab.
TI  - Development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. SETTING: A long-term care facility in Huntsville, Alabama. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. RESULTS: Results were compiled and reported according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Data. The most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant S. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. This poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. Development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. Implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.
TI  - The effect of inappropriate therapy on bacteremia by ESBL-producing bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of empiric appropriate treatment and the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with bacteremia by E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis producing ESBL. METHODS: Data were reviewed in an 8-year retrospective study, and 128 bacteremias were found: 80 caused by E. coli (62.5%), 28 by K. pneumoniae (21.9%) and 20 by P. mirabilis (18.6%). RESULTS: The initial antibiotic treatment, administered within 72 h after the first positive blood culture, was appropriate with carbapenems or other antimicrobial agents with documented in vitro sensitivity in 53.8 and 16% of patients, respectively. The overall mortality 21 days after diagnosis was 17.2%, and it was 14.9 and 35.2% for patients adequately and inadequately treated, respectively. At univariate analysis the p value for mortality with and without appropriate treatment was 0.05, and significant differences were found only for previous positive blood cultures (p = 0.004) and presence of septic shock at diagnosis (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: In this case series there was a high rate of initial appropriate empiric treatment, and only a marginal impact on mortality was found with regard to appropriate and inappropriate treatment. This report shows that the knowledge of ESBL-producing characteristics varies widely among the different case series for reasons that still have to be clarified.
TI  - Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteremias in the emergency department.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria have been spreading from hospitals to communities. Despite this, there are limited emergency department (ED) patient-based studies about these bacteremias. A retrospective matched case-control study with a ratio of 1:3 was conducted at a university hospital. The case group consisted of patients aged >16 years with ESBL-producing bacteremias in the ED. Patients matched for age and sex with non-ESBL-producing bacteremias were sampled as the control group. Finally, 64 episodes of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis bacteremias were included in our study. The median age of case patients was 71 years, and 29 (45.3%) were males. The most common type of infection was urinary tract infection (71.9%), followed by intra-abdominal infection (12.5%). Inappropriate empirical antibiotics therapy was prescribed in 87.5% of case patients, which was significantly higher than the control group (13.0%; p < 0.001). Patients with inappropriate empirical antibiotics had a significantly longer hospital stay than those with appropriate empirical antibiotics (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that hospital-acquired infection, urinary catheterization, and previous antibiotics use were independent risk factors for the acquisition of ESBL-producing bacteremia. The 28-day mortality rate of case patients was 18.8%. Whether they received appropriate empirical antibiotics treatment or not, there was no statistical difference in the mortality of patients with ESBL-producing bacteremias (p = 0.167). To face these emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria and to guide the empirical antibiotics therapy, it is crucial for emergency physicians to recognize the characteristics and risk factors for ESBL-producing organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in Cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out between February 2005 and November 2008 at the San Buenaventura University's Clinical Laboratory in Cartagena. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the Kirby Bauer method. RESULTS: Out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. The bacterium isolated most frequently was Escherichia coli (60.1 %) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), Proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). The Gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range 84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract infections in the patients involved in this study. The most commonly isolated bacteria were E. coli. Empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: Sperm immobilization factor isolated from Staphylococcus aureus immobilizes human spermatozoa as well as motile bacteria, showing that sperm immobilization factor receptor might be shared by bacteria and human spermatozoa. Thus, we sought to identify a common sperm immobilization factor binding receptor on spermatozoa and bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sperm immobilization factor was isolated from S. aureus. Sperm immobilization factor binding receptors were isolated from spermatozoa and bacteria. RESULTS: Antisperm antibodies in humans cross-reacted with bacteria antibodies. Thus, molecular similarities between determinants of spermatozoa and pathogenic microorganisms can be inferred. Sperm immobilization factor isolated from S. aureus immobilized spermatozoa (150 mug/ml) and motile bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis (500 mug/ml). This showed the presence of a common sperm immobilization factor binding conformation on spermatozoa and bacteria. Furthermore, receptors binding sperm immobilization factor were extracted and purified from spermatozoa, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria was confirmed by observing the blockage of spermatozoa immobilization by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of receptors isolated from spermatozoa, E. coli, P. aeruginosa or P. mirabilis. Also, a higher concentration of sperm immobilization factor (200 mug/ml) caused sperm death. Blocking the death of spermatozoa induced by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of these receptors provided further evidence for a common receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for molecular similarity between bacteria and spermatozoa.
TI  - [Evaluation of chromogenic medium Uriselect4 in urine culture].
AB  - We evaluated the performance and the cost of chromogenic medium Uriselect4 agar with regard to the standard medium for the detection and identification of urinary tract pathogens. A total of 503 clinical urine specimens containing leucocytes greater or equal to 104/mL were analysed prospectively, in parallel by two different persons on blood agar (GS) and Uriselect4 according to the manufacturers' instructions. Of the 503 urine specimens tested, 210 gave a positive culture on Uriselect4 versus 181 on GS. The majority of bacterial species grew on both media; enterobacteria grew on Uriselect4 better than GS. The identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis), KES group and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) did not require the use of galleries Api and has a gain of 24 h. Positive pure cultures on Uriselect4 corresponding to negative cultures of GS were noted in 17 ases. Conversely, in seven cases a positive pure culture on GS was noted while the corresponding Uriselect4 cultures were negative. The cost of identification on GS (including the cost of galleries Api), was about two times higher than Uriselect4. Uriselect4 medium isolates the most frequent urinary tract pathogens and identify them so almost immediately, with a lower cost.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Inhibition of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis adhesion and biofilm formation on medical grade silicone surface.
AB  - Silicone has been utilized extensively for biomedical devices due to its excellent biocompatibility and biodurability properties. However, its surface is easily colonized by bacteria which will increase the probability of nosocomial infection. In the present work, a hydrophilic antimicrobial carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) layer has been grafted on medical grade silicone surface pre-treated with polydopamine (PDA). The increase in hydrophilicity was confirmed from contact angle measurement. Bacterial adhesion tests showed that the PDA-CMCS coating reduced the adhesion of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis by >/= 90%. The anti-adhesion property was preserved even after the aging of the functionalized surfaces for 21 days in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and also after autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 20 min. Both E. coli and P. mirabilis readily form biofilms on the pristine surface under static and flow conditions but with the PDA-CMCS layer, biofilm formation is inhibited. The flow experiments indicated that it is more difficult to inhibit biofilm formation by the highly motile P. mirabilis as compared to E. coli. No significant cytotoxicity of the modified substrates was observed with 3T3 fibroblasts.
TI  - Urinary pathogens and drug susceptibility patterns of urinary tract infections among antenatal clinic attendees in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - AIM: To determine the bacterial agents involved in urinary tract infections in pregnant women and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: All consenting subjects who attended antenatal clinics of the University College Hospital and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, from 1 April 2007 and 30 March 2009 were interviewed to obtain demographic and pregnancy health data. Mid-stream urine samples obtained were processed by standard methods. Confirmed bacterial isolates were tested against seven antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Of the 473 specimens processed, 136 (28.8%) were positive for microscopy, 118 (25.0%) were culture positive, while 18 (3.8%) were microscopy positive but negative for culture. More than 90% of the bacterial isolates were Gram-negative bacilli, of which approximately 80% were members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Klebsiella oxytoca accounted for 45 (38.1%) of the causative agents identified, followed by Escherichia coli (31.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.3%) and Proteus mirabilis (6.8%). Candida albicans accounted for three (2.6%) of the isolates. Ten isolates (22.2%) of K. oxytoca were resistant to cefuroxime while three (6.7%) were resistant to ofloxacin. The only Gram-positive bacterium isolated, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, accounted for four (4.3%) of all pathogens, of which three (75.0%) were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, ofloxacin, cefuroxime and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the incidence of culture-positive urinary tract infection in pregnancy is common in Ibadan. More studies are needed to evaluate the susceptibility profile of uropathogens to commonly used antibiotics in our environment.
TI  - VIM and IMP metallo-beta-lactamases and other extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from environmental samples in a Tunisian hospital.
AB  - An extremely drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae species emerged in Kasserine Hospital, Tunisia between 2009 and 2010 causing a local outbreak. We aimed to characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from the hospital environment. Swabs were collected from ten different wards from Kasserine Hospital, Tunisia. A total of 46 isolates were cultured onto MacConkey agar supplemented with ceftazidime to select for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Identification and susceptibility patterns were performed using Phoenix-automated phenotypic identification criteria. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected using cefepime ESBL E-test. Colony blotting was first used to detect the occurrence of bla(SHV) , bla(CTX-M) , bla(CMY) , bla(IMP) , and bla(VIM) genes. PCR was used to amplify these genes, and the amplicons were sequenced and analyzed. Total DNA was digested with XbaI, and PFGE was used to type the major isolates that produced IMP-1. Among the 46 isolates, 63% were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13% were Escherichia coli, 8.7% were Proteus mirabilis, 6% were Enterobacter cloaceae, 4.3% were Providencia rettgeri, 2.5% were Serratia marcescens, and 2.5% were Pantoea agglomerans. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing showed that hospital environment isolates produced SHV-125, CTX-M-15, CMY-2 ESBLs, and IMP-1 and VIM-2 MBLs. PFGE typing showed the emergence of IMP-1 MBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates that were not clonal. In this study, we report the first characterization of IMP-1 and VIM-2 MBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates collected from Kasserine Hospital, Tunisia.
TI  - [Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in females--clinical aspects, aetiology and antimicrobial resistance epidemiology. Results of the ARESC (Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiological Survey on Cystitis) study in Poland and their implications for empiric therapy].
AB  - The Polish results of the international ARESC study are reported concerning clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. METHODS: Patients between 18 and 65 years with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and investigated clinically including urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested for nine antimicrobials RESULTS: In Poland a total of 212 patients were enrolled and 119 uropathogens from 118 patients were identified. Escherichia coli was the most frequent (90; 75.6%), followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5; 4.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (4; 3.4%), Proteus mirabilis (4; 3.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3; 2.5%), E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.9%) followed by mecillinam (97.8%), nitrofurantoin (92.2%), and ciprofloxacin (92.2%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (40.0%) followed by cotrimoxazole (80.0%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (97.1%), ciprofloxacin (93.1%), and nitrofurantoin (85.2%). The lowest rates were found again for ampicillin (43.2%) and cotrimoxazole (80.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and amoxicillin/clavulanate have preserved their good in vitro activity (> 80%) against both E. coli and the total spectrum of uropathogens.
TI  - Impact of adopting minimum inhibitory concentration as the determinant of susceptibility to cephalosporins and carbapenems in multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute has recommended that Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility to most cephalosporins and carbapenems be reported according to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) alone. We analyzed our record of multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae to assess the impact of these changes. We compared susceptibilities of ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae when using the 2009 and new 2010 MIC standards. Vitek2(R) (BioMerieux), was used to assess the changes in susceptibility. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., and Escherichia coli were the major species from urine, sputum, blood, and other sterile sites. The new breakpoint for cephalosporins increased resistance in E. coli and P. mirabilis. Many Proteus categorized as resistant by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection or inferred resistance have MICs to ceftriaxone </= 1 mcg/ml. New carbapenem breakpoints increased resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The increased ceftriaxone resistance from lowering breakpoints was almost balanced by the loss of resistance in ESBL isolates with MICs </= 1 mcg/ml. MIC-based susceptibility for multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae increases the number of resistant isolates. Inferring mechanisms of resistance has a disproportionate effect on the susceptibility of Proteus mirabilis to cephalosporins, and the MIC-based standard has an almost equivalent but opposite effect on Proteus mirabilis susceptibility to carbapenems.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity profile of bacterial pathogens in postoperative wound infections at a tertiary care hospital in Gujarat, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the most common bacterial pathogens responsible for post-operative wound infection and their antibiotic sensitivity profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational study was carried out in patients of postoperative wound infection. Samples from wound discharge were collected using a sterile swab and studied for identification of isolates by Gram stains and culture growth followed by in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing performed by disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. RESULTS: Out of 183 organisms, 126 (68.85%) isolated organisms were gram negative. Staphylococcus aureus, 48 (26.23%), was the predominant organism. S. aureus was sensitive to rifampicin (89.58%), levofloxacin (60.42%), and vancomycin (54.17%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (83.78%), gatifloxacin (51.35%), and meropenem (51.35%). Escherichia coli was sensitive to levofloxacin (72.41%) and ciprofloxacin (62.07%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (63.16%), levofloxacin (63.16%), gatifloxacin (63.16%), and linezolid (56.52%). Proteus mirabilis was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (75%) and linezolid (62.50). Proteus vulgaris was sensitive to ampicillin+sulbactam (57.14%) followed by levofloxacin (50%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an alarming increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly in the emergence of VRSA/VISA, meropenem, and third generation cephalosporin resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Linezolid showing sensitivity against Gram negative bacteria.
TI  - Phenolic compounds and biological activity of Kitaibelia vitifolia.
AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating the antioxidant activity and efficacy of the ethanolic extract of the endemic plant species Kitaibelia vitifolia in inhibiting the growth of selected fungi and bacteria. Antimicrobial activity was tested using the broth dilution procedure for determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). MICs were determined for eight selected indicator strains. The highest susceptibility to K. vitifolia ethanolic extract among the bacteria tested was exhibited by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC=15.62 mug/mL), followed by Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 (MIC=31.25 mug/mL), and Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315 (MIC=62.50 mug/mL). Of the fungi, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC=15.62 mug/mL) showed the highest susceptibility, and Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404 (MIC=31.25 mug/mL) had the lowest. Results showed that K. vitifolia extract possesses antioxidant activity, with total antioxidant capacity of 75.45+/-0.68 mug of ascorbic acid/g and 50% inhibition concentration values of 47.45+/-0.55 mug/mL for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, 35.35+/-0.68 mug/mL for inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation, 95.25+/-0.52 mug/mL for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and 31.50+/-0.35 mug/mL for metal chelating activity. Total phenolics, flavonoids, condensed tannins, and gallotannins were 85.25+/-0.69 mg of gallic acid (GA)/g, 45.32+/-0.55 mg of rutin/g, 54.25+/-0.75 mg of GA/g, and 41.74+/-0.55 mg of GA/g, respectively. The phenolic composition of K. vitifolia extract was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Rosmarinic acid was found to be the dominant phenolic compound of the extract.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological activities of five medicinal plant species from Cameroon traditional medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multiresistant microbial strains are on the increase. Fighting these diseases with natural products may be more efficacious. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and hexanic fractions of five Cameroonian medicinal plants (Piptadeniastum africana, Cissus aralioides, Hileria latifolia, Phyllanthus muellerianus and Gladiolus gregasius) against 10 pathogenic microorganisms of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts. METHODS: The fractions were screened for their chemical composition and in vivo acute toxicity was carried out on the most active extracts in order to assess their inhibitory selectivity. The agar well-diffusion and the micro dilution methods were used for the determination of the inhibition diameters (ID) and Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively on 8 bacterial species including two Gram positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and six Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi) and two fungal isolates (Candida albicans, Candida krusei). The chemical composition was done according to Harbone (1976), the acute toxicity evaluation according to WHO protocol and the hepatic as well as serum parameters measured to assess liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The chemical components of each plant's extract varied according to the solvent used, and they were found to contain alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpens, sterols, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The methanolic and ethylacetate extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastum africana presented the highest antimicrobial activities against all tested microorganisms with ID varying from 8 to 26 mm and MIC from 2.5 to 0.31 mg/ml. The in vivo acute toxicity study carried out on the methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastrum africana indicated that these two plants were not toxic. At the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, kidney and liver function tests indicated that these two medicinal plants induced no adverse effect on these organs. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, all these plant's extracts can be used as antimicrobial phytomedicines which can be therapeutically used against infections caused by multiresistant agents.

TI  - Nosocomial infection and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Northeast Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that degrade  beta-lactam antibiotics and have been reported to be an important cause of nosocomial infection in worldwide. METHODS: During 2009, 659 enterobacteria strains were isolated from different clinical specimens and tested for ESBL production. The disk approximation test, combined disk method and addition of clavulanic acid were used for phenotypic detection of the ESBL-producing strains and PCR for detection of the bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M) genes. RESULTS: Among the isolates, 125 were ESBL producers. The bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) genes were detected in 90.4% and 75% of the strains, respectively. Most strains were isolated from urine. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent organism. Microorganisms presented high resistance to the antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the need for extending ESBL detection methods to different pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family because these methods are only currently standardized by the CLSI for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. Carbapenems were the antibiotic class of choice for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Genetic features of blaNDM-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Genetic features associated with the bla(NDM-1) gene were investigated in 6 Escherichia coli, 7 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1 Proteus mirabilis, and 1 Providencia stuartii isolate of worldwide origin. Clonal diversity was observed for both E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The bla(NDM-1) gene was carried by different plasmid types (IncA/C, IncF, IncL/M, or untypeable) and was likely chromosome borne in two isolates. The bla(NDM-1) plasmids coharbored a variety of resistance determinants, including beta-lactamase genes, quinolone resistance genes, and 16S RNA methylase genes.
TI  - Dissemination of the rmtB gene carried on IncF and IncN plasmids among Enterobacteriaceae in a pig farm and its environment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characterization of 16S rRNA methylase-producing bacteria in a pig farm and its environment in East China. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae isolates and metagenomic DNA from 102 pig faecal samples from a pig farm and 97 soil samples taken in or around the farm were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA methylase genes. The clonal relationships of 16S rRNA methylase-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized. RESULTS: Fifty-six rmtB-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including 54 Escherichia coli, 1 Morganella morganii and 1 Proteus mirabilis, were recovered from 55 pig faecal samples. Nineteen rmtB-positive bacteria, including 13 E. coli, 2 M. morganii, 2 Leclercia adecarboxylata, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 Enterobacter cloacae, were recovered from 16 soil samples. Among the 75 rmtB-positive isolates, 31 and 25 also carried the qepA and bla(CTX-M) genes, respectively. The qepA gene co-localized with rmtB on the F2:A-:B1 plasmids and the bla(CTX-M-65) gene co-localized with rmtB on the F33:A-:B- plasmids. The rmtB gene was also found to be associated with the IncN plasmids. Clonal transmission of rmtB-positive E. coli isolates was observed between different pig groups and soil samples. CONCLUSIONS: Both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread could be responsible for the dissemination of the rmtB gene in the pig farm and its environment. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of rmtB-positive bacteria from farmland soils and indicates that these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes could be acquired by humans through the food chain.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - [Clinical and economic expedience of ertapenem therapy of complicated urinary tract infection].
AB  - Clinical and economic investigation of various antibiotics use in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (CUTI) was performed under the Russian economic environment. The drugs of comparison were ertapenem, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Direct costs and their structure were shown, and the cost efficiency was calculated. Alternative analysis and one-side susceptibility analysis were performed. In complicated urinary tract infections when the major pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis it was clinically and economically reasonable to start the treatment with ceftriaxone or ertapenem, while levofloxacin could be an alternative strategy. When the effects of the acquired resistance on the treatment effectiveness were evaluated (SIS model) it was shown that the pathogens susceptibility to ertapenem was preserved for a significantly longer time than that to ceftriaxone or levofloxacin (60 months). Such a parameter may serve as an additional evidence of the reasonable use of ertapenem as the starting treatment of CUTI.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected ethnomedicinal plants from South India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the antimicrobial potential of three ethnomedicinal plants Chassalia curviflora Thw. (C. curviflora), Cyclea peltata Hook. F. & Thomson (C. peltata) and Euphorbia hirta L (E. hirta) used in folk medicines in Aarukani hills Kani tribe, Tamil Nadu, India against human bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Antibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC 35218), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) (MTCC 733), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: The maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in C. peltata followed by C. curviflora. While E. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. The methanolic extract of C. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of C. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. All the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/mL) of methanolic extract of C. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/mL). The methanolic and hexane extracts of C. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. P. vulgaris and S. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. The methanolic and hexane extracts of E. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. S. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation revealed that the C. curviflora, C. peltata and E. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.
TI  - Susceptibility of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae according to the new CLSI breakpoints.
AB  - In 2010 the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) lowered the susceptibility breakpoints of some cephalosporins and aztreonam for Enterobacteriaceae and eliminated the need to perform screening for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and confirmatory tests. The aim of this study was to determine how many ESBL-producing strains of three common species of Enterobacteriaceae test susceptible using the new breakpoints. As determined with the CLSI screening and confirmatory tests, 382 consecutive ESBL-producing strains were collected at Huashan Hospital between 2007 and 2008, including 158 strains of Escherichia coli, 164 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 60 of Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility was determined by the CLSI agar dilution method. CTX-M-, TEM-, and SHV-specific genes were determined by PCR amplification and sequencing. bla(CTX-M) genes alone or in combination with bla(SHV) were present in 92.7% (354/382) of these ESBL-producing strains. Forty-two (25.6%) strains of K. pneumoniae harbored SHV-type ESBLs alone or in combination. No TEM ESBLs were found. Utilizing the new breakpoints, all 382 strains were resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, while 85.0 to 96.7% of P. mirabilis strains tested susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, 41.8 to 45.6% of E. coli strains appeared to be susceptible to ceftazidime and cefepime, and 20.1% of K. pneumoniae were susceptible to cefepime. In conclusion, all ESBL-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae would be reported to be resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone by using the new CLSI breakpoints, but a substantial number of ESBL-containing P. mirabilis and E. coli strains would be reported to be susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, which is likely due to the high prevalence of CTX-M type ESBLs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two essential oils.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of essential oils in vitro for possible application to reduce the content of microorganisms in the air of animal houses. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. were screened against bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and yeast Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the active essential oils was tested using broth dilution assay. The essential oils concentrations ranged from 0.1-50.0%. The combined effects of essential oils were tested for Malaleuca alternifolia L. and Cymbopogon citrarus L. concentrations ranged from 0.005-50.0%. The oils showed a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. Concentrations of 0.1-0.5% of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. reduced total microorganisms count of Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. High antibacterial activity was also revealed for Cymbopogon citrarus L. with bactericidal concentrations of 0.8% for Escherichia coli, 5.0% for Enterococcus faecium, 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations of Malaleuca alternifolia L. were 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium, and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus and Malaleuca alternifolia may be a promising alternative of air disinfection in animal houses.
TI  - Studies of Antimicrobial Activities of some 4-Thiazolidinone Fused Pyrimidines, [1,5]-Benzodiazepines and their Oxygen Substituted Hydroxylamine Derivatives.
AB  - Thiazolidin-4-one fused pyrimidines, [1,5]-benzodiazepines and their oxygen substituted hydroxylamine derivatives have been screened for antibacterial, antifungal and antimalarial activity. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhi were used for antibacterial screening. Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans were used for antifungal screening and Plasmodium species were used for antimalarial screening. The antibacterial and antifungal activities are expressed in terms of zone of inhibition and antimalarial activity is expressed in IC(50) value. Fifteen compounds 2Xa, 2Xb, 2Xc, 2Xs, 3IV, 3Va, 3Vc, 3VIIIa, 3VIIIh, 3IXa, 3IXb, 3IXc, 3Xa, 4IXa and 4Xa were tested for antibacterial as well as antifungal activity and seven compounds 2IXb, 2Xb, 3VIIIc, 3Xc, 4IXa, 4Xa and 4IXw were tested for antimalarial activity. Streptomycin, griseofulvin and chloroquine were taken as standard drugs in antibacterial, antifungal and antimalarial activity, respectively. The compound 2Xs was found significant antimicrobial against Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans as well as compound 3Xa was significant antimicrobial against Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, Salmonella typhi, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The compound 2Xb showed significant antimalarial activity.
TI  - Self-transmissibility of the integrative and conjugative element ICEPm1 between clinical isolates requires a functional integrase, relaxase, and type IV secretion system.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which are chromosomal mobile elements, can conjugatively transfer between bacteria. Recently, we identified a genomic island of Proteus mirabilis, a common agent of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI), that possesses all the properties consistent with an ICE. This element, designated ICEPm1, is highly conserved in other causative agents of UTI, suggesting its mobility. We demonstrate that ICEPm1 can actively excise from the chromosome in a clonal population of bacteria and that this excision is integrase dependent. Although in P. mirabilis HI4320, ICEPm1 is annotated as integrated into the phenylalanine tRNA gene pheV, we show that ICEPm1 can integrate into either pheV or pheU. We determined that ICEPm1 transfers at a frequency of 1.35 x 10(-5) transconjugants/donor to ICEPm1-deficient P. mirabilis using plate mating assays with clinical isolates. Insertional inactivation of a putative integrase gene on ICEPm1 decreased transfer frequencies of ICEPm1 to below the limit of detection. Mutation of the relaxase of ICEPm1 also eliminates transfer and demonstrates that this element is indeed self-transmissible and not transferred in trans, as are some mobilizable genomic islands. Together, these findings clearly demonstrate that ICEPm1 can actively excise from the chromosome in an integrase-dependent manner, dynamically integrate into both phenylalanine tRNA genes, and transfer into clinical strains using its own conjugation machinery.
TI  - Synthesis of P-triazinylphosphonium salts--hybrid molecules with potential antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The new hybrid drugs combining in a single molecule triazine ring attached to phosphonium salt were prepared and their bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC43300 (MRSA - methycyline resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain) two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli CCUG31997 serotype O153 (EPEC - enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strain), Proteus mirabilis 1784 (MDR - multidrug resistant clinical strain) were determined using microdilution method.
TI  - Recognition of DNA by the helix-turn-helix global regulatory protein Lrp is modulated by the amino terminus.
AB  - The AsnC/Lrp family of regulatory proteins links bacterial and archaeal transcription patterns to metabolism. In Escherichia coli, Lrp regulates approximately 400 genes, over 200 of them directly. In earlier studies, lrp genes from Vibrio cholerae, Proteus mirabilis, and E. coli were introduced into the same E. coli background and yielded overlapping but significantly different regulons. These differences were seen despite amino acid sequence identities of 92% (Vibrio) and 98% (Proteus) to E. coli Lrp, including complete conservation of the helix-turn-helix motifs. The N-terminal region contains many of the sequence differences among these Lrp orthologs, which led us to investigate its role in Lrp function. Through the generation of hybrid proteins, we found that the N-terminal diversity is responsible for some of the differences between orthologs in terms of DNA binding (as revealed by mobility shift assays) and multimerization (as revealed by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation). These observations indicate that the N-terminal tail plays a significant role in modulating Lrp function, similar to what is seen for a number of other regulatory proteins.
TI  - Molecular analysis of NDM-1-producing enterobacterial isolates from Geneva, Switzerland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the mechanisms responsible for decreased susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems in several enterobacterial isolates recovered in 2009-10 in Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland. METHODS: PCR and sequencing were used to identify beta-lactamases, 16S RNA methylases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. The transferable properties of the plasmids were analysed, as well as their plasmid type. The strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: Three patients were found to be positive for NDM-1-producing enterobacterial isolates (one with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, one with K. pneumoniae only and one with Proteus mirabilis), where NDM-1 stands for New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. The bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase gene was detected in all isolates in addition to genes encoding narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-1, SHV-11, OXA-1, OXA-9 and OXA-10), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M-15, CMY-16 and CMY-30), ArmA and quinolone resistance determinants (Qnr). The bla(NDM-1) gene was located on conjugative IncA/C- or IncF-type plasmids. Upstream of the bla(NDM-1) gene, part of ISAba125, previously identified in NDM-1-negative Acinetobacter baumannii, was found. Downstream of the bla(NDM-1) gene, variable sequences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This work constitutes the first identification of NDM-1 producers in Switzerland. Interestingly, patients from whom these NDM-1-producing isolates were recovered had a link with the Indian subcontinent or the Balkans.
TI  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1: local acquisition in Ontario, Canada, and challenges in detection.
AB  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a recently identified metallo-beta-lactamase that confers resistance to carbapenems and all other beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of aztreonam. NDM-1 is also associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The enzyme was first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in Sweden who had previously received medical treatment in India, but it is now recognized as endemic throughout India and Pakistan and has spread worldwide. The gene encoding NDM-1 has been found predominantly in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We describe the isolation NDM-1-producing organisms from two patients in Toronto, Ontario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism producing NDM-1 that was locally acquired in Canada. We also discuss the evidence that NDM-1 can affect bacterial species other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting organisms that produce NDM-1.
TI  - A novel compound from the marine bacterium Bacillus pumilus S6-15 inhibits biofilm formation in gram-positive and gram-negative species.
AB  - Biofilm formation is a critical problem in nosocomial infections and in the aquaculture industries and biofilms show high resistance to antibiotics. The aim of the present study was to reveal a novel anti-biofilm compound from marine bacteria against antibiotic resistant gram-positive and gram-negative biofilms. The bacterial extract (50 mug ml(-1)) of S6-01 (Bacillus indicus = MTCC 5559) showed 80-90% biofilm inhibition against Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and S6-15 (Bacillus pumilus = MTCC 5560) showed 80-95% biofilm inhibition against all the 10 tested organisms. Furthermore, they also reduced the hydrophobicity index and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. Structural elucidation of the active principle in S6-15 using GC-MS, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectral data revealed it to be 4-phenylbutanoic acid. This is the first report of 4-phenylbutanoic acid as a natural product. The purified compound (10-15 mug ml(-1)) showed potential activity against a wide range of biofilms. This study for the first time, reports a novel anti-biofilm compound from a marine bacterium with wide application in medicine and the aquaculture industry.
TI  - Screening of Australian plants for antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against C. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants against clinical isolates of oral cancer cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppression of immune system in treated cancer patients may lead to secondary infections that obviate the need of antibiotics. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the occurrence of secondary infections in immuno-suppressed patients along with herbal control of these infections with the following objectives to: (a) isolate the microbial species from the treated oral cancer patients along with the estimation of absolute neutrophile counts of patients (b) assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity medicinal plants against the above clinical isolates. METHODS: Blood and oral swab cultures were taken from 40 oral cancer patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D.S. Health University,Rohtak, Haryana. Clinical isolates were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. The medicinal plants selected for antimicrobial activity analysis were Asphodelus tenuifolius Cav., Asparagus racemosus Willd., Balanites aegyptiaca L., Cestrum diurnum L., Cordia dichotoma G. Forst, Eclipta alba L., Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng. , Pedalium murex L., Ricinus communis L. and Trigonella foenum graecum L. The antimicrobial efficacy of medicinal plants was evaluated by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. MIC and MFC were investigated by serial two fold microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23.2%), Escherichia coli (15.62%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.37%), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.81%), Proteus mirabilis (3.6%), Proteus vulgaris (4.2%) and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans (14.6%), Aspergillus fumigatus (9.37%). Out of 40 cases, 35 (87.5%) were observed as neutropenic. Eight medicinal plants (A. tenuifolius, A. racemosus, B. aegyptiaca, E. alba, M. koenigii, P. murex R. communis and T. foenum graecum) showed significant antimicrobial activity (P < .05) against most of the isolates. The MIC and MFC values were ranged from 31 to 500 mug/ml. P. aeruginosa was observed highest susceptible bacteria (46.6%) on the basis of susceptible index. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that treated oral cancer patients were neutropenic and prone to secondary infection of microbes. The medicinal plant can prove as effective antimicrobial agent to check the secondary infections in treated cancer patients.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens in Canada from 2007 to 2009:  CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - From January 2007 to December 2009, an annual Canadian national surveillance study (CANWARD) tested 2,943 urinary culture pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibilities according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The most frequently isolated urinary pathogens were as follows (number of isolates, percentage of all isolates): Escherichia coli (1,581, 54%), enterococci (410, 14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (274, 9%), Proteus mirabilis (122, 4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100, 3%), and Staphylococcus aureus (80, 3%). The rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) were 78, 86, 84, and 93%, respectively, for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and S. aureus. The rates of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin were 96, 97, 33, and 100%, respectively, for E. coli, enterococci, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. The rates of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 81, 40, 86, 81, 66, and 41%, respectively, for E. coli, enterococci, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. Statistical analysis of resistance rates (resistant plus intermediate isolates) by year for E. coli over the 3-year study period demonstrated that increased resistance rates occurred only for amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 1.8 to 6.6%; P < 0.001) and for SXT (from 18.6 to 24.3%; P = 0.02). For isolates of E. coli, in a multivariate logistic regression model, hospital location was independently associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (P = 0.026) with higher rates of resistance observed in inpatient areas (medical, surgical, and intensive care unit wards). Increased age was also associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (P < 0.001) and with resistance to two or more commonly prescribed oral agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and SXT) (P = 0.005). We conclude that frequently prescribed empirical agents for urinary tract infections, such as SXT and ciprofloxacin, demonstrate lowered in vitro susceptibilities when tested against recent clinical isolates.
TI  - Identifying patients harboring extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae on hospital admission: derivation and validation of a scoring system.
AB  - Increases in community-acquired infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have important implications for hospital infection control and empirical antibiotic therapy protocols. We developed and validated a tool for identifying patients harboring these organisms at hospital admission. We retrospectively analyzed chart data for 849 adult inpatients. The derivation cohort included 339 patients admitted to a large hospital in Rome during 2008, with (n = 113) or without (n = 226) culture positivity for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or Proteus mirabilis within 48 h after admission. Logistic-regression-based prediction scores were calculated based on variables independently associated with the outcome. The model was validated in a second cohort (n = 510) selected with identical criteria in hospitals in Genoa and Turin during 2009. Prediction scores were based on the following six variables (reported with odds ratio for study outcome and the 95% confidence intervals in brackets): recent (</= 12 months before admission) hospitalization (5.69 [2.94 to 10.99]), transfer from another health care facility (5.61 [1.65 to 19.08]), Charlson comorbidity score >/= 4 (3.80 [1.90 to 7.59]), recent (</= 3 months before admission) beta-lactam and/or fluoroquinolone treatment (3.68 [1.96 to 6.91]), recent urinary catheterization (3.52 [1.96 to 6.91]), and age >/= 70 years (3.20 [1.79 to 5.70]). The model displayed good calibration and good-to-excellent discrimination in the derivation and validation sets (Hosmer-Lemshow chi(2) = 15.28 and 14.07; P = 0.17 and 0.23; areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.83 and 0.92). It reliably identified patients likely to be harboring ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae at hospital admission who may need special infection control measures. Further study is needed to confirm this model's potential as a guide for prescribing empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in Egypt.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) is a rare disease with a high rate of mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of primary and secondary GNBM and to evaluate the efficacy of ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) in the treatment of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted including 95 patients with GNBM admitted to the Abbassia and Imbaba fever hospitals' meningitis wards in Egypt during the period from 1993 to the end of the year 2009. Their cerebrospinal fluid samples were subjected to conventional bacteriological methods for isolation of the causative Gram-negative bacilli. Forty-nine patients had primary GNBM (no predisposing cause of meningitis was detected) and 46 patients had secondary GNBM (with a predisposing cause of meningitis). RESULTS: Primary GNBM was characterized by an abrupt onset and was significantly associated with typical signs of meningeal irritation. The most common infecting organisms were Salmonella typhi in 16 (33%) patients and Escherichia coli in 15 (31%) patients. Of the patients with primary GNBM, 26 (53%) were cured, 11 (22%) developed neurological sequalae, and 12 (24%) patients died. Secondary GNBM was characterized by an insidious onset and significantly associated with unarousable coma. The most common infecting organisms were Proteus mirabilis in 17 (37%) patients and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16 (35%) patients. The most common predisposing factor of meningitis was otitis media and occurred in 26 (57%) patients. Of the patients with secondary GNBM, 15 (33%) were cured, 15 (33%) developed neurological sequalae, and 16 (35%) died. Primary GNBM was significantly associated with a higher cure rate than secondary GNBM. The duration of symptoms in patients with secondary GNBM was significantly higher than in those with primary GNBM. Ceftriaxone was the initial drug for treatment of these patients until the antibiotic sensitivity tests were reported. The overall resistance rate to the drug was 4%. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: GNBM still has a high mortality rate and should be managed as a medical emergency. GNBM should be suspected in patients with otitis media, neurosurgical, and head trauma or who underwent spinal anesthesia and have disturbance in their level of consciousness, even if there are no signs of meningeal irritation. Ceftriaxone is still an effective drug and had a low rate of resistance in our study.
TI  - Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.
AB  - Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an uncommon chronic destructive granulomatous process of renal parenchyma in association with long-term urinary tract obstruction and infection. It affects females more often than males, with a wide range of age, from newborn to elderly. Almost all patients are symptomatic and the most common symptoms are flank or abdominal pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, fever, palpable mass, gross hematuria, and weight loss. The common laboratory findings are leukocytosis and anemia. Urine cultures most often reveal Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis . Computed tomography is the mainstay of diagnostic imaging for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Imaging studies may demonstrate diffuse or focal form. Histologically, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis presents a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, xanthomatous histiocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. The differential diagnosis includes clear cell renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, malakoplakia, and megalocytic interstitial nephritis. Both antibiotics and surgery can be treatment options depending on the patient's disease status.
TI  - Transcriptome of Proteus mirabilis in the murine urinary tract: virulence and nitrogen assimilation gene expression.
AB  - The enteric bacterium Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of complicated urinary  tract infections. In this study, microarrays were used to analyze P. mirabilis gene expression in vivo from experimentally infected mice. Urine was collected at 1, 3, and 7 days postinfection, and RNA was isolated from bacteria in the urine for transcriptional analysis. Across nine microarrays, 471 genes were upregulated and 82 were downregulated in vivo compared to in vitro broth culture. Genes upregulated in vivo encoded mannose-resistant Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae, urease, iron uptake systems, amino acid and peptide transporters, pyruvate metabolism enzymes, and a portion of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. Flagella were downregulated. Ammonia assimilation gene glnA (glutamine synthetase) was repressed in vivo, while gdhA (glutamate dehydrogenase) was upregulated in vivo. Contrary to our expectations, ammonia availability due to urease activity in P. mirabilis did not drive this gene expression. A gdhA mutant was growth deficient in minimal medium with citrate as the sole carbon source, and loss of gdhA resulted in a significant fitness defect in the mouse model of urinary tract infection. Unlike Escherichia coli, which represses gdhA and upregulates glnA in vivo and cannot utilize citrate, the data suggest that P. mirabilis uses glutamate dehydrogenase to monitor carbon-nitrogen balance, and this ability contributes to the pathogenic potential of P. mirabilis in the urinary tract.
TI  - [CMY-2-type plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases emerging in Tucuman, Argentina].
AB  - In the last years, Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, have acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G) because of the presence of plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases. The aim of this work was to detect plasmid AmpC enzymes and to investigate the predominant types in our region. Between March and July 2009, 733 consecutive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae derived from hospitals and outpatient centers were studied. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion; one P. mirabilis and three E. coli strains showed resistance to cephamycins (cefoxitin) and C3G. An E-test to determine MIC and a synergy test by aminophenylboronic disks were performed. Enzymatic activity against cefoxitin was confirmed by a microbiological assay. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampC genes of different groups was performed and a 462-bp amplicon was obtained when using primers directed against the CIT group; the obtained sequences were compared to blaCMY-2 sequences, showing 100% identity. The emergence of CMY-2-type plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases indicated the importance of implementing systematic monitoring of these resistances to avoid potential clinical and epidemiological consequences.
TI  - Inhibition of iNOS reduces the therapeutic effects of ozone in acute necrotizing  pancreatitis: an in vivo animal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previously, it was shown that ozone and S-methylthiourea (SMT) treatments had ameliorative effects on experimental models of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP). It is possible that the combination of ozone and SMT may be more effective than either therapy. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of combination therapy with ozone and SMT in an experimental rat model of ANP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five experimental groups. Groups were designed as Sham-operated, ANP, ANP + Ozone, ANP + SMT and ANP + Ozone + SMT. A model of ANP was induced by injection of sodium taurocholate into the common biliopancreatic duct. Four days after induction, blood and tissue samples were obtained for biochemical, microbiological and histopathological analysis. RESULTS: Survival rates, serum amylase, lipase and neopterin levels, tissue oxidative stress parameters, bacterial translocation and tissue injury scores were better in the ozone and SMT groups than in the ANP group. There was no bacterial translocation in the ozone-treated groups. Tissue injury scores in the ozone group were better compared to all ANP induced groups. Ozone and SMT treatment in combination did not have better biochemical, microbiological and histological data compared to ozone or SMT treatments separately in experimental ANP. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ozone and SMT did not provide any therapeutic advantage in ANP possibly because SMT inhibited nitric oxide synthesis which was needed for ozone action.
TI  - Urine cultures from indwelling bladder catheters in nursing home patients: a point prevalence study in a Swedish county.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To survey the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance in urinary strains from patients with indwelling bladder catheters residing in nursing homes within a geographically defined region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine was sampled for culture from 163 catheter patients (126 men and 37 women) during a 2 week period in March 2010. Susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was compared with all urinary strains (n = 9994) from hospitals and primary healthcare in the same geographical area cultured during the first 6 months of 2010 (control group). RESULTS: Bacteriuria was found in 159 of 163 urine samples (98%). Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were the most common species, one or both being detected in 72% of the urine samples, while Proteus species were found in10% and a single isolate of Providentia species was seen.Strains in the study patients were more resistant to antibiotics than in the control group. Particularly large differences were noted for ciprofloxacinin in E. coli (16.9% vs 7.9%) and for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in E. faecalis (39.1% vs 24.8%). One extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was cultured (1.3%), compared with 1.6% in the control group. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Proteus mirabilis and Providentia species were rarely isolated, in sharp contrast to previous studies from geriatric hospital wards where they have often been in the majority. The limited incidence of ESBL and the absence of VRE and MRSA is gratifying, but the high resistance to antibiotics needs to be assessed on a continuous basis.
TI  - [Practice management of chronic bacterial prostatitis with levofloxacin].
AB  - The aim of this prospective observational study was to present relevant data on the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis (NIH-II) in the daily clinical routine of urologists in their practices. In total, 243 patients were treated, including 62 patients with a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis -based on expressed prostatic secretion (EPS). The current evaluation is based on these patients. Their median age was 53 years. The patients were treated with levofloxacin 500 mg / day for 29 days (median) which is in accordance to the -registered recommendation for this indication. Clinical symptoms were assessed using a standardised questionnaire. The clinical symptoms dysuria, painful ejaculation, perineal pain, urinary obstruction, increased urgency, prostate pain during palpation as well as CRP and number of leukocytes showed statistically significant improvements at the end of therapy with levofloxacin as compared to baseline. At the end of treatment 93.5 % (n = 58 / 62, 95 % confidence interval: 84.5 %-97.8 %) of the patients were cured or improved. The patients were able to resume their regular activities after 10 days (median). 93.5 % (n = 58 / 62) of the patients and 95.2 % (n = 59 / 62) of the doctors were satisfied or very satisfied with this treatment. In all 62 patients the diagnosis was microbiologically confirmed based on EPS. In 39 patients (62.9 %) E. coli was identified. At the end of therapy microbiological testing was performed in 62.9 % (n = 39 / 62) of the patients, in 29 cases including EPS. In 37 of these 39 patients (94.9 %) no pathogen was identified. In 2 cases (5.1 %) a pathogen was identified (Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus species). In 181 patients without microbiological confirmation -based on EPS comparable clinical results were found. In the total population of 243 patients 5 adverse drug reactions were reported in 3 patients (incidence 1.2 %, n = 3 / 243), The results of this study confirm the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in daily clinical practice.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in 2006].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1280 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (19 genus or species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2006. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.7% of Escherichia coli, 2.7% of Klebsiella spp., and 11.4% of Proteus spp. Notably, 18.8% of Proteus mirabilis was found to produce ESBL higher than 16.7% in 2004. This result was higher extremely than other species. Among Haemophilus influenzae, only 1.2% produced beta-lactamase and 62.8% that increased compared with 57.7% in 2004, were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Although few antibacterial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa have potent activity, only three agents--doripenem, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin-showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL. Of all P aeruginosa strains, 5.7% were resistant to six or more agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, a decrease compared to 8.7% in 2004. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2004.
TI  - Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens in a selected stretch of Bay of Bengal, India.
AB  - The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of urinary tract pathogens in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) affect all age groups and occur in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals and have serious impact on the socioeconomic life of the individual and the society, and also account for a large proportion of antibacterial drug consumption. Treatment failure has been attributed to increasing resistance to common antibiotics, but there is paucity of data from this part of Nigeria. This prospective study was carried out to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of uropathogens in Ibadan using standard microbiological diagnostic methods. Statistical analysis was by simple percentages among related variables. Four hundred and nine urinary isolates, 239 (58.4%) and 170 (41.6%) from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients respectively were studied. Frequency of occurrence of urinary pathogens were Klebsiella spp 171 (41.8%), Pseudomonas species (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) 81 (19.8%), Escherichia coli 78 (19.1%), Staphylococcus aureus 31 (7.6%) and Proteus mirabilis 31 (7.6%). Resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin 97%, tetracycline 93%, cotrimoxazole 98%, and amoxycillin 89% was observed among most uropathogens. Seventy-five to 100% Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to the common antibiotics and also 87.1% and 82.4% were resistant to nalidixic acid and cefuroxime respectively. However, appreciable susceptibility by all uropathogens was found with amikacin 75%, ciprofloxacin 72.2%, ceftriaxone 68.4%, and pefloxacin 64.9%. Isolates from the community showed more susceptibility to tested drugs. In conclusion, widespread resistance to most antibiotics including cephalosporins and quinolones was found among all uropathogens.
TI  - Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Proteus
AB  - The Gram-negative bacilli of the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter,and Proteus(Table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. With the exception of Proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. Many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. Today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. A limited number of species, including E coli, K pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, S marcescens,and P mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. The increasing incidence of the coliforms, Proteus, and other Gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (R factors). Also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host defenses.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - In vitro synthesis of biogenic amines by Brochothrix thermosphacta isolates from  meat and meat products and the influence of other microorganisms.
AB  - Twenty Brochothrix thermosphacta strains tested for biogenic amines (BAs) production, formed histamine (6.6-16.2 mg/kg) and tyramine (18.7-35.4 mg/kg) but neither putrescine nor cadaverine. Six of the twenty strains were also investigated in respect of their influence on the synthesis of BAs by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Proteus mirabilis and Lactobacillus sakei. In pure culture Escherichia coli produced all of the studied amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) with a total concentration of 167.7 mg/kg, P. mirabilis produced a total of 56.7 mg/kg histamine, tyramine and cadaverine, while Lactobacillus sakei and Pseudomonas sp. produced histamine and tyramine, totaling 37.9 and 35.2 mg/kg respectively. All B. thermosphacta promoted cadaverine production by Escherichia coli which increased by 12-68%, and some of them contributed to the appearance of this amine among the metabolites of Pseudomonas. The presence of B. thermosphacta decreased the potential ability of P. mirabilis to produce BAs.
TI  - Relationship between the cAMP levels in leukocytes and the cytokine balance in patients surviving gram negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes secrete proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12. Over-activation of host defense systems may result in severe tissue damage and requires regulation. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-10 are candidate cytokines for inducing tolerance to lipopolysaccharide re-stimulation. We compared cytokines secreted by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood cells from patients who had survived gram negative bacterial pneumonia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, n = 26) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 18). Interleukin-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression was significantly lower in patients (p = 0.0039 and p<0.001) compared to healthy controls, while granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production was markedly higher in patients (p<0.001). Levels of interleukin-10 were comparable. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor expression was inversely correlated with interleukin-12p70 (R = -0.71, p<0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (R = -0.64, p<0.001) expression; interleukin-10 showed no significant correlation. In unstimulated leukocytes from patients, cAMP levels were significantly raised (p = 0.020) and were correlated inversely with interleukin-12p70 levels (R = -0.81, p<0.001) and directly with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (R = 0.72, p = 0.0020), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (R = 0.67, p = 0.0067) and interleukin-10 (R = 0.54, p = 0.039) levels. Our results demonstrate that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes is a useful indicator of tolerance induction in surviving pneumonia patients and that measuring cAMP in freshly isolated leukocytes may also be clinically significant.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide A3-APO in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  - Although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide A3-APO has only modest activity against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with conventional antibiotics. In this study, the efficacy of A3-APO in several additional mouse models was investigated, including Staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed Klebsiella pneumoniae-A. baumannii-Proteus mirabilis wound infection and K. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. Whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. In the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following A3-APO treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. The wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A3-APO upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. One of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.
TI  - Bacteremia in a multilevel geriatric hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. Bacteremia in the elderly remains a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge to the clinician. METHODS: We investigate the clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcome of bacteremic episodes in a mixed LTC elderly population in a multilevel geriatric hospital. Data of patients with the diagnosis of BSI (during 2 years) was collected retrospectively from the records of the bacteriology laboratory of a 400-bed multilevel geriatric hospital. RESULTS: During the 2 years of the study period, 3453 blood cultures have been performed; 368 positive blood cultures (10%) were detected in 309 patients. The total mortality rate at 2 weeks was 42%. One quarter of the deaths occurred in the first 3 days of the septic event (rapidly fatal period). Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (detected in 31% of cases). The second most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (19%; 63% of them MRSA) with a mortality of 39% and Proteus mirabilis (18%) with a 51% mortality rate. Urinary tract infection was the leading cause (70%), followed by decubitus ulcers (25%) and respiratory tract infections (12%). CONCLUSIONS: the number of elderly skilled patients with severe and complex conditions in LTC facilities is increasing and more infections complicated by bacteremia are expected, requiring high clinical suspicion, close surveillance, and adequate reporting.
TI  - Thrombocytes are effectors of the innate immune system releasing human beta defensin-3.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombocyte concentrate i.e. platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a  popular adjunct for many surgical procedures. It is believed to improve bone and soft tissue healing. Recently antimicrobial effects of the autologous preparation were reported by several groups. In this study we investigated the antimicrobial effect of PRP against gram-negative microbes which frequently cause severe complications in orthopaedic trauma surgery. METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma was produced from liquid preserved thrombocyte concentrates. ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were preformed to investigate the release and content of platelet concentrates. A radial diffusion assay was used to detect antimicrobial effects of PRP. RESULTS: We detected the human beta defensin-3 in bactericidal concentrations in platelet preparations by ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In antimicrobial testing we demonstrated effective inhibition of Escherichia coli (ATCC 11303), Bacterium megaterium (ATCC 14581), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Proteus mirabilis (ATCC21100). CONCLUSION: With this study we demonstrate antimicrobial action of a popular adjunct for orthopaedic and trauma surgery against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We have identified a possible mechanism of action via the secretion of HBD-3 as a first line defence in contaminated wounds and in elective application of PRP. This finding supports a broader spectrum of clinical indications for an autologous platelet preparation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.
TI  - Expression and characterization of a second L-amino acid deaminase isolated from  Proteus mirabilis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - L-amino acid deaminases catalyze the deamination of natural L-amino acids. Two types of L-amino acid deaminase have been identified in Proteus species. One exhibits high levels of activity toward a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic L-amino acids, typically L-phenylalanine, whereas the other acts on a relatively narrow range of basic L-amino acids, typically L-histidine. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and characterized a second amino acid deaminase, termed Pm1, from P. mirabilis KCTC 2566. Homology alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of Pm1 demonstrated that the greatest similarity (96%) was with the L-amino acid deaminase (LAD) of P. vulgaris, and that homology with Pma was relatively low (72%). Also, similar to LAD, Pm1 was most active on L-histidine, indicating that Pm1 belongs to the second type of amino acid deaminase. In agreement with this conclusion, the V(max) and K(m) values of Pm1 were 119.7 (mug phenylpyruvic acid/mg/min) and 31.55 mM phenylalanine, respectively, values lower than those of Pma. The Pml deaminase will be very useful industrially in the preparation of commercially valuable materials including urocanic acid and alpha-oxoglutarate.
TI  - Prevalence and phenotypic characterisation of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream isolates in a tertiary care hospital in India.
AB  
TI  - Influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  - Referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. In this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI). We identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with Gram-negative BSI in a referral cohort of patients treated at Mayo Clinic Hospitals and a population-based cohort of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. Elderly patients aged >/=80 years with Gram-negative BSI were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.30-0.62] as were females (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53-0.74). After adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of Escherichia coli (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.43-0.58) and Proteus mirabilis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.70-3.06), Enterobacter cloacae (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.53-3.66), Serratia marcescens (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.33-4.52) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (OR 17.94, 95% CI 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented in the referral cohort. We demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with Gram-negative BSI had an influence on referral patterns. These factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in expanded spectrum beta lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae in Morocco.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although independently acquired, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance appears to be linked with extended-spectrum or AmpC-type beta-lactamases. Since no data are available in African countries, the prevalence of qnr genes at the University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Morocco, was investigated. METHODOLOGY: Between October 2006 and March 2007, the following 39 randomly selected non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), representing 20% of ESBL strains with respect to species and ward origin, were collected: Escherichia coli (n = 16); Klebsiella spp (n = 14); Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8); Proteus mirabilis (n = 1). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI guidelines. ESBL detection was performed by the double disc diffusion test. A multiplex PCR was conducted to detect qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes that were confirmed by sequencing of the PCR product. RESULTS: The estimated overall prevalence of qnr reached 36% (n = 14; qnrA, 10.25%; qnrB, 23.07%; qnrS, 2.56%). Genes were identified in E. coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter with a respective prevalence of 18.7%, 50% and 62.5%. The qnr genes were detected in nine wards and qnrA1, qnrB1-B2-B4 and qnrS1 variants were identified. Three genes were identified among nalidixic acid susceptible strains (n = 6); three of those were also susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Among nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistant strains, all strains had qnrB. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high prevalence of qnr genes among ESBL strains in the Ibn Rochd CHU, Casablanca. Moreover, qnr were present in quinolone-susceptible strains which could lead to in vivo selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.
TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - The prevalence and bacteriology of asymptomatic bacteriuria among antenatal patients in Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital Nnewi; South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection in pregnancy leads to poor pregnancy outcome. Diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria markedly improves pregnancy outcome as well as reduce the incidence of acute pyelonephritis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and bacteriology of asymptomatic bacteriuria among Antenatal patients in our centre, and to know if routine screening will be justifiable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out between April and August 2008. Sample size was statistically determined. Women who consented were interviewed and mid stream urine samples were collected and processed in the microbiology laboratory, using standard microbiological methods. RESULTS: Out of 357 women studied, 65(18.21%) had significant bacteriuria. Escherichia coli was the commonest isolate (25.6%), while proteus mirabilis was the least frequent isolate (3.66%). Women in third trimester had the highest prevalence (25.68%) while those in the first trimester had the least (15.79%). Women that had only primary education had the highest prevalence (27.50%) while those that had tertiary education had the least prevalence (21.10%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of significant asymptomatic bacteriuria among the women studied was high. Screening of all the pregnant women and treatment will reduce the incidence and complications of overt urinary tract infection in pregnancy among these women.
TI  - The Salmonella genomic island 1 is specifically mobilized in trans by the IncA/C  multidrug resistance plasmid family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a Salmonella enterica-derived integrative mobilizable element (IME) containing various complex multiple resistance integrons identified in several S. enterica serovars and in Proteus mirabilis. Previous studies have shown that SGI1 transfers horizontally by in trans mobilization in the presence of the IncA/C conjugative helper plasmid pR55. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the ability of different prevalent multidrug resistance (MDR) plasmids including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene-carrying plasmids to mobilize the multidrug resistance genomic island SGI1. Through conjugation experiments, none of the 24 conjugative plasmids tested of the IncFI, FII, HI2, I1, L/M, N, P incompatibility groups were able to mobilize SGI1 at a detectable level (transfer frequency <10(-9)). In our collection, ESBL gene-carrying plasmids were mainly from the IncHI2 and I1 groups and thus were unable to mobilize SGI1. However, the horizontal transfer of SGI1 was shown to be specifically mediated by conjugative helper plasmids of the broad-host-range IncA/C incompatibility group. Several conjugative IncA/C MDR plasmids as well as the sequenced IncA/C reference plasmid pRA1 of 143,963 bp were shown to mobilize in trans SGI1 from a S. enterica donor to the Escherichia coli recipient strain. Depending on the IncA/C plasmid used, the conjugative transfer of SGI1 occurred at frequencies ranging from 10(-3) to 10(-6) transconjugants per donor. Of particular concern, some large IncA/C MDR plasmids carrying the extended-spectrum cephalosporinase bla(CMY-2) gene were shown to mobilize in trans SGI1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The ability of the IncA/C MDR plasmid family to mobilize SGI1 could contribute to its spread by horizontal transfer among enteric pathogens. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of IncA/C plasmids in MDR S. enterica isolates worldwide has potential implications for the epidemic success of the antibiotic resistance genomic island SGI1 and its close derivatives.
TI  - The nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.
AB  - This study was conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout Japan between January 2008 and June 2008. A total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. The strains investigated in this study are as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), Escherichia coli (n = 255), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), Proteus mirabilis (n = 42), Serratia marcescens (n = 44), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) manual. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Although a majority of the E. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and S. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. The proportions of E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%, and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. These data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.
TI  - Unexpected coregulator range for the global regulator Lrp of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The Lrp/AsnC family of transcription factors links gene regulation to metabolism  in bacteria and archaea. Members of this family, collectively, respond to a wide range of amino acids as coregulators. In Escherichia coli, Lrp regulates over 200 genes directly and is well known to respond to leucine and, to a somewhat lesser extent, alanine. We focused on Lrp from Proteus mirabilis and E. coli, orthologs with 98% identity overall and identical helix-turn-helix motifs, for which a previous study nevertheless found functional differences. Sequence differences between these orthologs, within and adjacent to the amino acid-responsive RAM domain, led us to test for differential sensitivity to coregulatory amino acids. In the course of this investigation, we found, via in vivo reporter fusion assays and in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, that E. coli Lrp itself responded to a broader range of amino acids than was previously appreciated. In particular, for both the E. coli and P. mirabilis orthologs, Lrp responsiveness to methionine was similar in magnitude to that to leucine. Both Lrp orthologs are also fairly sensitive to Ile, His, and Thr. These observations suggest that Lrp ties gene expression in the Enterobacteriaceae rather extensively to physiological status, as reflected in amino acid pools. These findings also have substantial implications for attempts to model regulatory architecture from transcriptome measurements or to infer such architecture from genome sequences, and they suggest that even well-studied regulators deserve ongoing exploration.
TI  - [Comparison of four phenotypic methods to detect extended-spectrum betalactamases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of four phenotypic methods for the identification of strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases isolated from urine cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative cross-sectional study. 147 strains isolated from positive urine cultures for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis between January and February 2009 in the National Institute of Health of Children underwent a screening test, those which resulted positive were processed for confirmatory testing through the four phenotypic methods evaluated. RESULTS: Out of the 147 strains, 43 (29.3%) were suspicious in the screening tests. Using the method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) as a reference standard for this study, 27 strains (62.8%) were positive, with similar results using Jarlier's method. On the other hand, using Hodge's and tridimensional methods 23 (53.5%) of samples were positive. The evaluation of the confirmation methods in comparison to the one described by CLSI, showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for Jarlier's method, on the other hand, for Hodge's and tridimensional methods we found a sensitivity of 85.2% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All the evaluated methods showed a high efficacy, without significant differences, so they could all be used according to the available facilities of each clinical laboratory. Nevertheless, due to its advantages besides the technical aspect, like costs, easiness and feasibility of its application, we recommend the use of Jarlier's method.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin  structure infections: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the spectrum and potency of ceftaroline, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal cephalosporin, against a 2008 surveillance collection of clinical isolates from patients in the USA and Europe. METHODS: A collection of 14 169 isolates of various bacterial species from complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) was tested for susceptibility to ceftaroline and 19 comparator agents in a central reference laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were received from 55 medical centres; 27 in the USA and 28 in Europe (12 countries, including Israel). The clonality of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with elevated ceftaroline MICs (4 mg/L) was determined by PFGE and single and multilocus sequence typing, and the mechanism of ceftaroline non-susceptibility was assessed by molecular methods (PCR amplification and sequencing). RESULTS: Ceftaroline, the active component of the parenteral prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, was active against 2988 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, with an MI(9)(0) of 1 mg/L. The MIC(9)(0) for methicillin-susceptible strains was 0.25-0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline was additionally active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(9)(0), 0.5-1 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(5)(0), 2 mg/L), beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(9)(0), 0.015-0.25 mg/L) and three commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis; MIC(9)(0) values of 0.25 to > 16 mg/L). All but four isolates of MRSA (0.13%) had ceftaroline MIC values of </= 2 mg/L. The isolates for which ceftaroline MICs were 4 mg/L were clonal (single Greek hospital) and had detectable mecA mutations (N146K, N204K, E150K and H351N). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline yearly (2008) surveillance for the USA and Europe documented low MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0) values for MRSA isolates at 1/1 and 1/2 mg/L, respectively. Ceftaroline demonstrated promising potency and coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause cSSSIs, including MRSA and beta-haemolytic streptococci.
TI  - [Epidemiological and bacteriological characteristics of uropathogen bacteria isolated in a pediatric environment].
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is a grave pathology, which requires a  fast and effective care. Bacteriological and epidemiological data play a determining role in patient's care. We report a retrospective study, which spreads out from January 1st till August 31st, 2009, having concerned hospitalized children for urinary infection in pediatrics service of Farhat Hached teaching hospital in Sousse. Our series contained 51 children with a sex ratio of 0.76, an average age of 32 months. The majority of cases was pyelonephritis (94.1%). A pathology is associated with the urinary infection in 41.2%. Three cases of vesico-ureteral reflux were noted. The diagnosis of urinary infection was confirmed by cytobacteriological exam of urine (CBEU). Enterobacteriacea were isolated in 96.1%. Escherichia coli remains the most often isolated (80.4%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%) then by Proteus mirabilis (5.9%). E. coli was resistant to amoxicillin in 78% of cases, to the association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in 64,8%, to cephalosporins of 3(rd) generation (C3G) in 5% and to cotrimoxazole in 51%. No K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis strain was resistant to C3G. UTI in children is always an indication for CBEU realization at first intention. The results of this exam are very important considering the diversity of the responsible bacteria and the growing frequency of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Salmonella genomic islands and antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in several Salmonella enterica serovars that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans is due to a set of related genomic islands carrying a class 1 integron, which carries the resistance genes. Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), the first island of this type, was found in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 isolates, which are resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulfonamides and tetracycline. Several Salmonella serovars and Proteus mirablis have since been shown to harbor SGI1 or related islands carrying various sets of resistance genes and some distinct groups have emerged. SGI1 is an integrative mobilizable element and can be transferred experimentally into Escherichia coli. However, within serovars, isolates recovered from different parts of the world appear to be clonal, indicating that SGI1 movement may be rare. Potential reservoirs in food-producing animals or in ornamental fish have been identified for some serovars.
TI  - Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Proteus mirabilis in Hangzhou, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenems are used to treat severe infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms, however, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacterial isolates is becoming an increasing therapeutic challenge. Since the first Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae was reported in 2001, KPC-producing isolates have been found increasingly, specially in Enterobacteriaceae. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of a carbapenem-resistant Proteus (P.) mirabilis. METHODS: A carbapenem-resistant P. mirabilis isolate was recovered from pleural drainage fluid of a patient admitted to surgical intensive care unit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolate was performed by disk diffusion according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, and subsequent minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined with the E-test. Amplification of the bla(KPC) gene generated a positive band and the PCR products were sequenced subsequently. The plasmid of the isolate was extracted and was successfully transformed into Escherichia (E.) coli DH5alpha. RESULTS: The P. mirabilis isolate was resistant to all detected antimicrobial agents except tigecycline. KPC-2 was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The transformant E. coli was resistant to carbapenems. Further study demonstrated that upstream and downstream regions of bla(KPC-2) were identical to that observed in K. pneumoniae submitted to GenBank from China in 2007. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem resistance in the P. mirabilis isolate in this study is mainly due to production of KPC-2.
TI  - Occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in hens' eggs depending on their source and  storage conditions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the qualitative composition of Gram-negative microbes, mainly of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, in the albumens and yolks and on the shells of hens' eggs, depending on their source and on the temperature and duration of their storage. A total of 375 table eggs were studied, from a large-scale poultry farm, a small-scale poultry farm and a supermarket. Each group was divided into 5 subgroups according to the temperature and duration of their storage during the study. Two serotypes of bacteria of the genus Salmonella were identified: S. Enteritidis and S. Arizonae. Strains of Salmonella spp. were also isolated. Apart from Salmonella and Escherichia coli, among the most frequently isolated bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp. and Citrobacter freundii. Qualitative analysis of the bacterial microflora of the eggs also showed the presence of other Gram negative bacteria, including Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Tatumella ptyseos, Providencia stuartii, Serratia liquefaciens, Flavimonas oryzihabitans, Vibrio metschnikovii, Leclercia adecarboxylata, Kluyvera spp., Rahnella aquatilis, Proteus mirabilis, and Achromobacter spp. The study demonstrated that the conditions applied, i.e., the temperature and duration of storage, did not significantly influence the prevalence of particular species of Gram-negative bacteria in the eggs. However, based on the analysis of contamination of eggs with Salmonella depending on their source, it can be concluded that the system in which the hens are housed affects the risk of contamination of eggs with these pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Survival of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria against DNA damaging agents.
AB  - Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSBs) were isolated from different plant rhizosphere soils of various agroecological regions of India. These isolates showed synthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), production of gluconic acid, and release of phosphorus from insoluble tricalcium phosphate. The bacterial isolates synthesizing PQQ also showed higher tolerance to ultraviolet C radiation and mitomycin C as compared to Escherichia coli but were less tolerant than Deinococcus radiodurans. Unlike E. coli, PSB isolates showed higher tolerance to DNA damage when grown in the absence of inorganic phosphate. Higher tolerance to ultraviolet C radiation and oxidative stress in these PSBs grown under PQQ synthesis inducible conditions, namely phosphate starvation, might suggest the possible additional role of this redox cofactor in the survival of these isolates under extreme abiotic stress conditions.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of intra-abdominal gram-negative bacilli from Europe: SMART Europe 2008.
AB  - As part of the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), a total of 3,030 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli from intra-abdominal infections were collected from 43 hospital centres from 13 European countries during 2008. Of 51 species, the most commonly isolated species were Escherichia coli (49.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.6%). Respectively, 17.9%, 11.6%, 5.5% and 4.5% of K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and K. oxytoca were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibilities were determined using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoints. The most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were amikacin, ertapenem and imipenem. Overall, with the exception of the carbapenems, most agents exhibited dramatically reduced susceptibilities against ESBL-positive and multi-drug-resistant isolates.
TI  - [The bacteriological profile of bacteriuria in residents of a long-term geriatric facility].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known on the bacteriological profile of consecutive urine samples in elderly patients institutionalized in nursing homes. AIM: This retrospective study aims to characterize urinary pathogens, rates of isolation of the same pathogen in subsequent urine samples and predicting factors associated with such repeated isolations. Data were retrospectively retrieved from medical charts of nursing home patients during a four-year period. The authors looked for changes in rates of positive cultures, changes in urine flora, in rates of repeated isolation of the same pathogens and the possible interrelations with the use of antibiotics. METHODS: A total number of 3229 urine cultures were studied, 1311 of which (43%) were positive and 493 out of these positive cultures (37.6%) were treated with antibiotics. The rates of positive cultures increased consistently during the study period (p=0.003). E. coli (68.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis accounted for more than 90% of positive cultures. RESULTS: There was no difference with regard to pathogen types isolated from symptomatic or asymptomatic cases. The rates of recurrent bacteriuria, by the same pathogen isolated at baseline urine culture, were similar in treated and untreated cases. A regression analysis aiming to predict factors associated with subsequent positive cultures had negative results, except for cases of untreated bacteriuria with pseudomonas (CI 1.36-7.09, O.R. 3.11, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data support earlier studies underscoring the need to carefully consider the role of antibiotics and for better clinical guidelines for the treatment of bacteriuria in this population.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are a group of plasmid-mediated, diverse, complex and rapidly evolving enzymes that are posing a major therapeutic challenge today in the treatment of hospitalized and community-based patients. Infections due to ESBL producers range from uncomplicated urinary tract infections to life-threatening sepsis. Derived from the older TEM is derived from Temoniera, a patient from whom the strain was first isolated in Greece. beta-lactamases, these enzymes share the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid. In addition, ESBL-producing organisms exhibit co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, resulting in limitation of therapeutic option. Because of inoculum effect and substrate specificity, their detection is also a major challenge. At present, however, organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) provide guidelines for the detection of ESBLs in Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. In common to all ESBL-detection methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against ESBL-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence of clavulanic acid. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. ESBLs represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in the face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. Thus there is need for efficient infection-control practices for containment of outbreaks; and intervention strategies, e.g., antibiotic rotation to reduce further selection and spread of these increasingly resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Etiology and sensitivity of uropathogens identified in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women (ARESC Study): implications on empiric therapy].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology and susceptibility of uropathogens identified in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter study (ARESC) in 9 Spanish hospitals, 803 female patients with uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and evaluated to identify the uropathogens and their susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials. RESULTS: Of 803 patients with uncomplicated cystitis, 784 patients were included. A positive urine culture was found in 87.7% of the samples. Of the 650 pathogens isolated, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the most frequent (79.2%) followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), Proteus mirabilis (4.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.3%). E. coli showed a high rate of susceptibility to phosphomycin (97.2%), nitrofurantoin (94.1%) and somewhat lower to ciprofloxacin (88.1%). Fluorquinolone resistance rates were higher among postmenopausal women (17 versus 10%). E. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (65%) and cotrimoxazole (34%) and 25% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanalic acid and cefuroxime. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, E. coli shows high resistance rates to widely used antimicrobial antibiotics. Phosphomycin and nitrofurantoin have a high in vitro activity. Taking into account practical aspects such as convenience (only one dose), and the influence of the amount of fluorquinolone use on enterobacteriaceae and other microorganisms resistance levels, phosphomycin trometamol represents the option of first choice for the empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.
TI  - Clinical and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a long-term study from Japan.
AB  - The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in Japan are very low ( approximately 5%) compared with those obtained worldwide. Further, the current trend of these bacteria in Japan is not known, and few studies with longitudinal observations have been reported. To obtain epidemiologic data on ESBL-producing bacteria, their genotypic features, and their antibiotic resistance patterns in Japan, we analyzed bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients at our institution over the 7-year period from 2003 to 2009. Of 2,304 isolates, 202 (8.8%) were found to be ESBL producers, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis. The detection rates of the ESBL-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 17.1% and 10.5% for the E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, respectively, in 2009. Genotyping analysis showed that approximately 90% of the ESBL-producing isolates carried the CTX-M genotype, in which the CTX-M-9 group was predominant, although the CTX-M-2 group is considered to be the main genotype in Japan; further, many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. The detection rates of ESBL-producing bacteria may tend to be high within a limited region in Japan. A countrywide survey is required to understand the trend for ESBL-producing bacteria at the national level. In addition, our findings suggest that the genotypes of the detected ESBL producers are similar to those exhibiting a successful nosocomial spread worldwide.
TI  - Prevalence of bacteria and parasites in White Ibis in Egypt.
AB  - A field survey was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial infections among free-living White Ibis (Nipponia nippon) in which 92 bacterial isolates were recovered from 193 different internal organs of 55 apparently healthy Ibis. Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. were isolated at rates of 43.6% and 14.5%, respectively. The other bacterial pathogens isolated were Shigella spp. (34.5%), Enterobacter spp. (21.8%) Citrobacter spp. (18.1%), Klebsiella pneumonia (16.3), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%) and Proteus mirabilis (7.2%). The antibiogram indicated that all isolates were highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, trimethoprim and penicillin. Penicillin was most effective against S. aureus. An examination of the gastrointestinal tract revealed the presence of a nematode, Ascaris (Porroceacum ensicaudatum), and three trematodes (Echinochasmus perfoliatus, Apatemon aracilis and Patagifer bilobus). Other trematodes were detected in enlarged gall bladder and kidney lesions. Histopathological examination showed signs of hepatitis. The gall bladder had cholangitis, cholicystitis which may have been caused by trematode infestation. The kidneys also showed multiple parasitic cysts of trematodes and non-suppurative interstitial nephritis. This study suggests the possible role of the White Ibis, when living near poultry populations, in transmitting certain pathogens to poultry.
TI  - Prevalence and resistance patterns of extended-spectrum and AmpC beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella serovar Stanley in a Korean tertiary hospital.
AB  - A total of 100 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 35), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 63), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Salmonella serovar Stanley (n = 1), showing resistance to cefoxitin, or returning positive in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) ESBL confirmatory method, were studied. The isolates were examined by the boronic acid (BA) disk test, polymerase chain reaction, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to investigate genetic similarities. The concurrence rates for ESBLs by the CLSI and the BA disk test were 97% for E. coli and 96.7% for K. pneumoniae. A total of 41 isolates showing cefoxitin resistance yielded all positive by the BA disk test. All the 33 K. pneumoniae isolates, which showed positive by the BA disk test, were carrying AmpC genes. The TEM and CTX-M types were predominant in E. coli and the SHV and the CIT and/or DHA types were predominant in K. pneumoniae. PFGE analysis showed almost 75% of genetic similarities among K. pneumoniae isolates producing ESBLs and/or AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpCs) as each K. pneumoniae carried variable genes and showed variable antibiotic patterns. Clearly, the BA disk test was a useful method for the detection of ESBLs and AmpCs. In particular, cefoxitin resistance and BA-positive trait of K. pneumoniae do reflect the presence of AmpC genes in the organism.
TI  - Risk factors for hospital-acquired urinary tract infection: a case-control study.
AB  - The objective is to assess risk factors and microbiological aspects of hospital-acquired urinary tract infection (HAUTI) on six wards of a general regional hospital in Serbia. A case-control study was nested within prospective cohort HAUTIs study conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2007. Three controls were identified for each patient with HAUTI, being chronologically the next three patients surveyed who did not develop HAUTI. The patients and controls were matched by sex and age (+/-5 years). Assessment of 8,467 patients during the study period revealed HAUTI in 125 (116 symptomatic and 9 asymptomatic). The overall incidence rate of HAUTI was 14.8 cases/1,000 admissions. The mean age (range) of cases and controls was 64.9 (18-85) and 65.2 (17-86), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that duration of catheterization >5 days (OR = 51.91; 95% CI = 23.46-114.82) and the ASA score (OR = 13.42; 95% CI = 2.14-84.30) were independently associated with increased risk of HAUTIs. The most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria were Enterobacter, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Enterococcus sp. was the most frequent Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - High frequency of beta-lactam susceptibility in CTX-M-type extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis according to the new CLSI recommendations.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. In experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees C and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. From the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Staphylococcus aureus species. These 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. All contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. In samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. In experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C. Semen with E. coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. This reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). In conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Structural basis of Na(+)-independent and cooperative substrate/product antiport  in CaiT.
AB  - Transport of solutes across biological membranes is performed by specialized secondary transport proteins in the lipid bilayer, and is essential for life. Here we report the structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from Proteus mirabilis (PmCaiT) at 2.3-A and from Escherichia coli (EcCaiT) at 3.5-A resolution. CaiT belongs to the family of betaine/carnitine/choline transporters (BCCT), which are mostly Na(+) or H(+) dependent, whereas EcCaiT is Na(+) and H(+) independent. The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na(+)-dependent transporters LeuT and BetP, but in CaiT a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na(+) ion to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na(+)-independent transport. Both CaiT structures show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. EcCaiT contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with Hill coefficients up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. We propose a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms of hygienic interest in an organized abattoir in Mumbai, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of food-borne illnesses in India is unknown because of  lack of surveillance networks. Monitoring the prevalence of food-borne pathogens and indicators of contamination in primary production at abattoirs is imperative for creating a data bank and for effective control of such pathogens before they enter the food chain. METHODOLOGY: Microorganisms of hygienic interest were screened for their prevalence at Deonar Abattoir, Mumbai. Swab samples from 96 sheep/goat carcass sites were collected and analyzed for Staphylococcus spp., Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Average Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis counts were 3.15 +/- 0.18 and 3.46 +/- 0.17 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium spp. counts were 3.10 +/- 0.08, 3.41 +/- 0.19 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. The Escherichia coli count was 3.54 +/- 0.06 and the Klebsiella aerogenes count was 3.22 +/- 0.22 log10 CFU/cm(2). Counts for Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis were 3.44 +/- 0.14 log10 CFU/cm(2) and 3.71 +/- 0.12 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. S. epidermidis had the highest percentage prevalence at (41.6%), followed by K. aerogenes (31.9%), B. subtilis (28.2%) and P. vulgaris (23.6%). Salmonella spp. were not isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate high prevalence and diversity of micro flora on carcasses in the primary Indian production facility, which might be attributed to either human handling or improper dressing especially during evisceration process. Appropriate training for personal and production hygiene is essential for workers in Indian meat production facilities.
TI  - Adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Fimbriae of the human uropathogen Proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. PMI2122 (AipA) and PMI2575 (TaaP) are annotated in the genome of strain HI4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. The C-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in AipA and 76 aa in TaaP are homologous to the translocator domains of YadA from Yersinia enterocolitica and Hia from Haemophilus influenzae. Comparative protein modeling using the Hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. Recombinant AipA and TaaP were seen as approximately 28 kDa and approximately 78 kDa, respectively, in Escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. E. coli synthesizing AipA or TaaP bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain. Inactivation of aipA in P. mirabilis strains significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade HEK293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. A 51-aa-long invasin region in the AipA passenger domain was required for this function. E. coli expressing TaaP mediated autoagglutination, and a taaP mutant of P. mirabilis showed significantly (P < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than HI4320. Gly-247 in AipA and Gly-708 in TaaP were indispensable for trimerization and activity. AipA and TaaP individually offered advantages to P. mirabilis in a murine model. This is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in P. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a phospholipase A2 from the venom of the Saw-scaled viper: Novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  - Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. In this study, a basic myotoxic PLA(2), named EcTx-I was isolated from Echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on Superdex G-75, and reverse phase HPLC on C18 and C8 Sepharose columns. PLA(2), EcTx-I was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by MALDI-TOF (15 kD by SDS-PAGE), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. The N-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic PLA(2)s from other snake venoms. The purified PLA(2) EcTx-I was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW&TES), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. EcTx-I showed strong antibacterial activity against B. pseudomallei (KHW) and E. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. Other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. However, the Gram-positive bacterium E. aerogenes failed to show any effect on EcTx-I protein at tested doses. The most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of EcTx-I was observed at MICs of >15 mug/ml against (B. pseudomallei, KHW) and MICs >30 mug/ml against E. aerogenes. Mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. EcTx-I was able to induce cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in BALB/c mice. EcTx-I also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. It is shown that the toxic effect induced by E. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic PLA(2) (EcTx-I). The result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. In conclusion, EcTx-I displays a heparin binding C-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.
TI  - [Analysis of drug resistance and risk factors of Enterobacteriaceae in burn units].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of infection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing strains and drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae that infected burn patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on clinical information of 92 patients with Enterobacteriaceae infection in our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2008. The distribution and drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, and the detection rate, drug resistance of ESBL-producing strains, and its risk factors of nosocomial infection were analyzed. Data were processed with Chi-square test. RESULTS: One hundred and nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated, with 38 (34.9%) strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 25 (22.9%) strains of Escherichia coli, 22 (20.2%) strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 (11.9%) strains of Proteus mirabilis, and 11 (10.1%) other strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Enterobacteriaceae were moderately or highly resistant to antibiotics except imipenem, resistance rate of which was less than 8.0%. ESBL-producing strains accounted for 44.0% in Escherichia coli, and 77.3% in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Drug-resistance rate of ESBL-producing strains to antibiotics was obviously higher than that of non ESBL-producing strains. Length of hospital stay longer than 20 days, and use of the third-generation cephalosporin longer than 5 days, quinolone antibiotics longer than 7 days, and topical antibiotics longer than 5 days were the risk factors of nosocomial infection caused by ESBL-producing strains, comparing with non ESBL-producing strains, the difference was statistically significant (with chi2 value respectively 5.491, 4.441, 15.186, 4.938, P values all below 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae strains in burn unit of our hospital are highly drug resistant, with high lactamase-producing rates, calling for intense monitor to control the risk factors that predispose the infection of ESBL-producing strains in order to lower the infection rate.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega].
AB  - The urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. Urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. From February 2008 to January 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. From these cultures 1037 were positive. From this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. In bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. It was verified that the most frequent microorganism was Escherichia coli, followed by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that Escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. Proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. For Klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and Enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. In conclusion, this study shows that Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. Therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. A periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  - Histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (41 of Hafnia alvei, 17 of Serratia liquefaciens, 5 of Enterobacter cloacae, 4 of Citrobacter braakii, 2 of Proteus vulgaris, 2 of Proteus mirabilis, 2 of Providencia stuartii, 2 of Klebsiella terrigena, 1 of Rahnella aquatilis, 1 of Salmonella arizonae, 1 of Citrobacter youngae and 1 of Escherichia coli) isolated from Botillo, a Spanish traditional sausage. In general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the exception of two strains of H. alvei and the E. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. The strains of P. mirabilis and P. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. Accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. Biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. Maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the R. aquatilis strain to 7325 mg/l in a H. alvei strain. Maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the R. aquatilis strain to 1935 mg/l in a S. liquefaciens strain.
TI  - Host-pathogen interactions in urinary tract infection.
AB  - The urinary tract is a common site of bacterial infections; nearly half of all women experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime. These infections are classified based on the condition of the host. Uncomplicated infections affect otherwise healthy individuals and are most commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, whereas complicated infections affect patients with underlying difficulties, such as a urinary tract abnormality or catheterization, and are commonly caused by species such as Proteus mirabilis. Virulence and fitness factors produced by both pathogens include fimbriae, toxins, flagella, iron acquisition systems, and proteins that function in immune evasion. Additional factors that contribute to infection include the formation of intracellular bacterial communities by E. coli and the production of urease by P. mirabilis, which can result in urinary stone formation. Innate immune responses are induced or mediated by pattern recognition receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophils. The adaptive immune response to UTI is less well understood. Host factors TLR4 and CXCR1 are implicated in disease outcome and susceptibility, respectively. Low levels of TLR4 are associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria while low levels of CXCR1 are associated with increased incidence of acute pyelonephritis. Current research is focused on the identification of additional virulence factors and therapeutic or prophylactic targets that might be used in the generation of vaccines against both uropathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
TI  - Laboratory surveillance for prospective plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in  the Kinki region of Japan.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PABLs), and plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamases confer resistance to many beta-lactams. In Japan, although several reports exist on the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases, the prevalence and characteristics of PABLs remain unknown. To investigate the production of PABLs, a total of 22,869 strains of 4 enterobacterial species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis, were collected during six 6-month periods from 17 clinical laboratories in the Kinki region of Japan. PABLs were detected in 29 (0.13%) of 22,869 isolates by the 3-dimensional test, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing analysis. PABL-positive isolates were detected among isolates from 13 laboratories. Seventeen of 13,995 (0.12%) E. coli isolates, 8 of 5,970 (0.13%) K. pneumoniae isolates, 3 of 1,722 (0.17%) K. oxytoca isolates, and 1 of 1,182 (0.08%) P. mirabilis isolates were positive for PABLs. Of these 29 PABL-positive strains, 20 (69.0%), 6 (20.7%), 2 (6.9%), and 1 (3.4%) carried the genes for CMY-2, DHA-1, CMY-8, and MOX-1 PABLs, respectively. Pattern analysis of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that the prevalence of CMY-2-producing E. coli strains was not due to epidemic strains and that 3 DHA-1-producing K. pneumoniae strains were identical, suggesting their clonal relatedness. In conclusion, the DHA-1 PABLs were predominantly present in K. pneumoniae strains, but CMY-2 PABLs were predominantly present in E. coli strains. The present findings will provide significant information to assist in preventing the emergence and further spread of PABL-producing bacteria.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections at Clinical Centre in Kragujevac--prevalence study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial infections (NIs) are a serious health problem in hospitals worldwide and are followed by a series of consequences, medical, judicial, ethical and economic. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of NIs at the Clinical Centre in Kragujevac. METHODS: A prevalence study of nosocomial infections was conducted from 16th till 20th May, 2005, within Second National Prevalence Study of Nis in the Republic of Serbia. RESULTS: The study included 866 patients. 40 patients had a NI, thus the prevalence of patients with NIs and prevalence of NIs was the same, 4.6%. Among NIs, the most frequent were urinary infections (45.0%) followed by surgical-site infections (17.5%), skin and soft tissue infections (15%) and pneumonia (12.5%). The rate of NIs was highest at departments of orthopaedics and traumatological surgery (12.0%), followed by intensive care units (8.0%). Overall, 67.5% (27/40) NIs were culture-proved; the leading pathogens were Escherichia coli (40.0%), followed by gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas species, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacteriaceae with equal frequency of 8.0%). Nosocomial infections were significantly more frequent in patients aged > or = 65 years (p < 0.05), with longer hospitalization > or = 8 days (p < 0.00), in intensive care patients (p < 0.05), patients with an intravenous catheter (p < 0.00), urinary catheter (p < 0.00), and those under antibiotic therapy (p < 0.00). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the prevalence of nosocomial infections in our hospital is similar to the prevalence in the developed countries. The study of prevalence provides a prompt insight into basic epidemiological and ethiological characteristics of nosocomial infections, hence identification of hospital priorities and the need to undertake appropriate prevention measures.
TI  - Selective strategy for urethral catheterization in febrile young girls to confirm urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of bacterial infections in childhood. Making a proper diagnosis is important but requires invasive urine collection techniques. We aimed to derive a clinical decision rule to identify non-toilet-trained febrile girls at high risk for UTIs to restrict urethral catheterizations (UCs) to this high-risk group of patients. METHODS: We included all non-toilet-trained girls with a positive microscopic urinalysis from urine collected by sterile bag in a prospective cohort study to derive a model to predict UTI assessed by urine culture from UC. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. Absence of another source of fever on examination and the child's unusual behaviour were found to be independent predictors of UTI. The corresponding model offered an 85% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI): 56-96], with a 59% specificity (95% CI: 30-83) for UTI. The internal cross-validation by bootstrap led to an 85% sensitivity (95% CI: 68-100), and a 59% specificity (95% CI: 35-83). CONCLUSION: We derived a clinical decision model to selectively identify young febrile girls at high risk for UTI with a positive microscopic analysis and propose UC with an 85% sensitivity, which would avoid approximately 60% of unnecessary UCs; although further validation is necessary before daily clinical use.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded blaCMY-2 located on a novel SXT/R391-related integrating conjugative element in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  - Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. Although SXT/R391-related ICEs, originally demonstrated in Vibrio cholerae O139 isolates, have become prevalent among V. cholerae isolates in Asia, the prevalence of the ICEs among gram-negative bacteria other than Vibrio spp. remains unknown. In addition, SXT/R391-related ICEs carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. Here we carried out a genetic analysis of a cefoxitin-resistant Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, TUM4660, which revealed the presence of a novel SXT/R391-related ICE, ICEPmiJpn1. ICEPmiJpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of R391 and carried xis and int genes completely identical to those of R391, while an IS10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(CMY-2) was integrated into the ICE. A nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of ISEcp1 was located upstream of the bla(CMY-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(CMY-2) in earlier studies were also present. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in ICEPmiJpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in SXT(MO10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in P. mirabilis ATCC 29906, respectively. ICEPmiJpn1 was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. These observations suggest that ICEs may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ICEs, including SXT/R391-related ICEs.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two Croatian hospitals: MYSTIC study results.
AB  - The meropenem yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. We now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective Gram-negative pathogen groups from two Croatian Hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. A total of 1510 Gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI.There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. Acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant Gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. Almost 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in E. coli was 10% and in K. pneumoniae 49%. PCR and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of SHV-5 in nine E. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. Five K. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(SHV-5 )gene. Eight ESBL positive Enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and CtX-m beta-lactamases. Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases were not found among K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Enterobacter spp. Three A. baumannii strains from Zagreb University Center were identified by multiplex PCR as OXA-58 like producers. Six A. baumannii strains from Split University Center were found to possess an ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(OXA-51 )gene. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. These data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for A. Baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in type 2 diabetic subjects with and without microalbuminuria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic subjects, especially women, show high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of ASB in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) with and without microalbuminuria (MA). FINDINGS: A hundred diabetic subjects with MA (53 males/47 females, mean age +/- standard deviation: 65.5 +/- 11.1 years) and 100 diabetic subjects without MA (52 males/48 females, mean age +/- standard deviation: 65.4 +/- 11.3 years), consecutively attending the outpatient diabetes clinic of our hospital were recruited in the study. Subjects with overt diabetic nephropathy or nephropathy from other causes were excluded. In addition, subjects with symptoms of urinary track infection or use of antimicrobial drugs in the last 14 days were excluded by the study.Diabetic subjects with MA showed increased prevalence of ASB compared to diabetic subjects without MA (21% versus 8%, P < 0.001, respectively). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen isolated in diabetic subjects with and without MA (12% versus 3.0%, P = 0.01, respectively) followed by Proteus mirabilis (6% versus 5%, P = 0.75, respectively) and Klebsiella spp (5% versus 1%, P = 0.09, respectively). Univariate logistic analysis showed that ASB was associated with the presence of coronary artery disease [odds ratio (OR): 0.29, 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI): 0.09-0.95, P = 0.04] and gender (OR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02-0.35, P < 0.001) in the diabetic study group with MA. CONCLUSIONS: ASB is more prevalent among T2D subjects with MA. Screening for ASB is warranted in diabetic patients especially if pyuria is detected in urine analysis since ASB has been found to be a risk factor for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection.
TI  - Determinants of beta-lactam resistance in meningitis-causing Enterobacteriaceae in Brazil.
AB  - This study analyzed resistance determinants in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteria and the epidemiology of 11 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from meningitis patients in a region of Brazil from 2000 to 2005. ESBL-encoding genes and their genetic environment were investigated by PCR and sequencing. The gene blaCTX-M-2 was identified in 3 different enterobacteria (E. coli, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) downstream of the insertion sequence ISCR1 (localized in class 1 integrons), but not as part of the resistance cassettes region. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to investigate genetic relationships between the 11 E. coli isolates in this study and strains associated with meningitis in the E. coli MLST database. MLST analysis indicated high genetic diversity among isolates, and no significant genetic relationship was identified with meningitis-causing E. coli in the database. The results in this report reinforce the need to be attentive to meningitis suspected to be due to ESBL-producing enterobacterial isolates, especially where ESBL epidemiology is well known.
TI  - [Detection of bla(CTX-M) beta-lactamase genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - Widespread production of CTX-M type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in Enterobacteriaceae strains which are resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the most remarkable example for rapid and global spread of plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. Consecutive 200 ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae strains out of 1640 isolates that were obtained from clinical samples (167 urine, 11 wound, 7 bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 peritoneal fluid, 2 cerebrospinal fluid, 2 biopsy, 2 tracheal aspirate, 2 conjunctiva, 1 abscess, 1 catheter) between February to July 2009 in our laboratory were included to this study. Among the 200 ESBL positive isolates 141 (70.5%) were Escherichia coli, 51 (26%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 (2.5%) were Enterobacter spp. and one of each (0.5%) Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. ESBL positivity was 11% among the 123 community-acquired strains and 13% among the 77 hospital acquired strains, the statistical difference being insignificant (p > 0.05). The prevalence of bla(CTX-M) beta-lactamase genes were detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with the use of two general primer sets: CTX-MA1 and CTX-MA2 primers for the amplification of CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-9 enzymes group, and CTX825-F and CTX825-R primers for the amplification of CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-25 enzymes group. bla(CTX-M) genes were detected in 167 out of 200 strains (83.5%). CTX-M production rates in community and hospital acquired strains were found as 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively and no statistically significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). CTX-M producing strains were either E. coli (n = 132) or Klebsiella spp. (n = 35) and were expressing one of the enzymes from CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2 or CTX-M-9 groups. No strains carrying CTX-M-8 or CTX-M-25 group enzymes were detected. CTX-M production rates in ESBL producing E. coli strains in community and hospital were found as 92.5% and 95.7%, respectively, whereas the same rates for ESBL producing Klebsiella spp. strains were 67.8% and 66.7%. The difference between the CTX-M production rates of community and hospital acquired strains was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In conclusion, CTX-M prevalence was found high in ESBL producing strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Since bla(CTX-M) gene acquisition usually results in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, screening for CTX-M type ESBL production in the laboratory has an important impact on monitoring the resistant strains which have endemic potential.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefditoren and other antimicrobials against Enterobacteriaceae causing community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a Spanish nationwide multicenter study.
AB  - Cefditoren is a third-generation orally administered cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. After an oral 400-mg single dose, the mean concentrations in urine are 186.5 mg/L at 2 to 4 h and 12.7 mg/L at 8 to 12 h, and it is a potential drug to be used in the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). We performed a multicenter nationwide study in Spain in order to determine the in vitro activity of cefditoren and other comparative agents against Enterobacteriaceae causing community-acquired uncomplicated UTI in women. From June 2008 to March 2009, 89 institutions participated in the study. A total of 2152 Enterobacteriaceae were collected and sent to a coordinating laboratory where identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against 20 antimicrobials using an automated microdilution method (MicroScan; Siemens, Sacramento, CA). Cefditoren MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines) using the same inoculum. Microorganisms isolated were Escherichia coli (81.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.9%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and others (5.1%). A total of 51 isolates (2.4%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, 3 (0.1%) produced plasmidic AmpC enzymes, and 64 (2.9%) produced chromosomal AmpC. The MIC(50)/MIC(90) (mg/L) of cefditoren against all isolates was 0.12/0.5. Cefditoren inhibited 96.5% of isolates at 1 mg/L and was uniformly active against all isolates with the exception of strains producing ESBLs or AmpC enzymes. The MIC(50)/MIC(90) of other antimicrobials were ampicillin (AMP) >16/>16, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (A/C) <or=8/4/16/8, cefuroxime (FUR) <or=4/8, cefotaxime <or=1/<or=1, ciprofloxacin (CIP) <or=0.12/>2, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SxT) <or=2/38/>4/76, and fosfomycin (FOS) <or=16/<or=16. The respective percentages of resistance were 61%, 17.2%, 5.5%, 2.3%, 20.2%, 27.4%, and 4.8%. The activity of cefditoren against Enterobacteriaceae producing community-acquired uncomplicated UTI in women was superior to that of AMP, A/C, FUR, CIP, and SxT and similar to that of FOS.
TI  - The use of lytic bacteriophages in the prevention and eradication of biofilms of  Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Antibiotics have been the cornerstone of the clinical management of bacterial infections since their discovery in the early part of the last century. Eight decades later, their widespread, often indiscriminate use, has resulted in an overall reduction in their effectiveness, with reports of multidrug-resistant bacteria now commonplace. Increasing reliance on indwelling medical devices, which are inherently susceptible to biofilm-mediated infections, has contributed to unacceptably high rates of nosocomial infections, placing a strain on healthcare budgets. This study investigates the use of lytic bacteriophages in the treatment and prevention of biofilms of bacterial species commonly associated with infections of indwelling urological devices and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The use of lytic bacteriophages against established biofilms of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli is described, whereby biofilm populations have been reduced successfully by three to four log cycles (99.9-99.99% removal). The prevention of biofilm formation on Foley catheter biomaterials following impregnation of hydrogel-coated catheter sections with a lytic bacteriophage has also been investigated. This has revealed an approximate 90% reduction in both P. mirabilis and E. coli biofilm formation on bacteriophage-treated catheters when compared with untreated controls.
TI  - [Clinical assessment of novel ChromID ESBL agar plates for detection of ESBL producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. ChromID ESBL agar newly developed for screening ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was released in Japan in April, 2007. We evaluated the clinical assessment of ChromID ESBL agar in routine microbiology laboratory. The 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae with the MICs of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. The 27 ESBL-producers examined were comprising of 19 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 S. marcescens (ESBL group) and 20 ESBL non-producers consiating of 5 K. oxytoca, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 P. vlugaris, 2 Serratia marcescens, 8 C. freundii, 2 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 E. aerogenes (non-ESBL group). Characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. As the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of ChromID ESBL agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. It should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. These findings clearly suggested that in cases of utilizing ChromID ESBL agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the ESBL-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to CPDX.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing otitis externa in dogs.
AB  - Bacterial agents are considered important pathogens causing external otitis in dogs. It is essential to carry out bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test in the case of otitis externa, particularly for chronic or recurring cases. Sterile swab samples were obtained from terminal part of vertical ear canals of 74 dogs with otitis externa for cytology, bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. Cytologic smears were stained using Gram and Giemsa staining methods. Aerobic bacterial culture performed on blood agar and MacConkey agar. Among total number of 92 isolated bacteria, 68 were Staphylococcus intermedius. Other isolated bacteria included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella canis, and six other species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed for all isolated bacteria using 14 antibiotics. Based on the results of this study, all isolated Staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to amikacin, enrofloxacin, and rifampin, and had low resistance to gentamicin, cephalothin and ceftriaxone. More than half of gram-positive isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Generally, all isolated gram-negative bacteria, were sensitive to amikacin and enrofloxacin, and had low resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin. They were highly resistant to penicillin, eythromycin, and cephalothin. Regarding the results of this study, in cases of uncomplicated otitis externa, it is possible to select antimicrobial drugs merely based on cytology, but it is recommended to perform bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. However, in complicated or refractory cases, antimicrobials should be selected based on bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative nonurinary bacteria to fosfomycin and other antimicrobials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fosfomycin is an antimicrobial commonly used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin against nonurinary Gram-negative isolates has not been widely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates in a region of Greece where considerable antimicrobial resistance has been detected. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the microbiological library of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. We retrospectively examined the susceptibility of all Gram-negative nonurinary isolates to fosfomycin, collected over 1 year (January-December 2008). RESULTS: A total of 594 nonurinary Gram-negative isolates were examined. Susceptibility testing was performed for 270 (45.4%) Enterobacteriaceae, 209 (35.2%) Gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli and 115 (19.4%) other Gram-negative bacteria. In total, 385 (64.8%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, all Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella species isolates were susceptible. Additionally, 73 out of 94 (77.7%) Klebsiella pneumoniae (including carbapenem-resistant strains), 22 out of 32 (68.8%) Enterobacter species and 51 out of 79 (64.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility was highest amongst isolates (45 of 61; 73.8%) taken from outpatients and lowest for intensive care unit isolates (78 of 161; 48.4%). Isolates originating from the pediatric wards exhibited higher susceptibility (45 of 63; 71.4%) than isolates originating from other departments (340 of 531; 64%). CONCLUSION: In a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance, fosfomycin seems to exhibit good levels of in vitro activity against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates. These data justify further evaluation of its potential clinical effectiveness.
TI  - Effect of uropathogens on in vitro encrustation of polyurethane double J ureteral stents.
AB  - Polyurethane stents are used when there is an obstruction to the flow of urine. A majority of the patients with such stents are at the risk of urinary tract infection and salt encrustation. The present study is aimed at analyzing the in vitro encrustation of calcium oxalate and other salts in the presence of common uropathogens (E. coli and P. mirabilis) on films made from Tecoflex((R)), a commercial grade polyurethane. In the absence of uropathogens, sodium ions and ammonia favor calcium adsorption whereas magnesium ions greatly depress it, resulting in increased hydrophillicity of the stent. With E. coli, Mg ions enhance the encrustation of calcium, whereas the other salts decrease its deposition. In case of P. mirabilis, irrespective of the type of salt, it enhances calcium encrustation except in the presence of sodium ions. Adhesion of uropathogens to the stent surface was higher in the presence of bovine serum albumin. Understanding the dynamics between various salts and microorganism in the urine, and urine-stent interface would aid in designing stents that are inert, resist encrustation and biofilm formation.
TI  - Most frequent causes of urinary tract infections in children.
AB  - AIM: to determine the most frequent causes of urinary tract infection (UTI) amongst children according to gender and age. METHODS: 299 children with urinary tract infections were evaluated. All of the cases were clinically evaluated and quantitative and qualitative examinations of the urine (culture with antibiogram) were done. RESULTS: There were 54.58% males and 45.15% females in the research group. Similar distribution was present in age groups: 1-28 days (67.86% male, 32.14% female), 1 month up to 1 year (64.56% male, 35.44% female), 2-6 years (55.29% male, 44.71% female). The only difference was found in the age group of 7-16 years where there were more female patients (56.07% female, 43.93% male). Based on microbiological findings, in 91.3o% of the cases only one species was isolated, and more than one species was isolated in 8.70% of cases. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infection (62.88%), the second most common was Klebsiella (23.080/%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (7.02%), Citrobacter(5.35%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.34%) and Candida albicans (0.33%). E. coli was the most frequent causative of UTI amongst children of all ages. In the age group of newborns, E. coli was isolated as the etiological causative of UTI in 57.14% of cases. In the age group ofi month-1 year, E.coli was the most frequent cause of urinary tract infection (60.76%). In the age group of 2-6 years, E.coli was the most frequent cause of urinary tract infection (74.12%). In the age group of 7-16 years, E. coli was isolated in 59.81% of cases. Klebsiella was the second most frequent causative (23.08%) and with a higher incidence in the age group of newborns (42.86%). CONCLUSION: UTI was generally more present in male patients. E. coli was the most frequent cause of UTI in children of all age, while the second most frequent cause of UTI in children was Klebsiella.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Bioefficacy of Lantana camara L. against Some Human Pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial efficacy of flavonoids (free and bound) and crude alkaloids of Lantana camara L. was determined by disc diffusion assay against three bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus) and two fungi (Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes). Minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration and total activity were also studied. Most susceptible microorganism in the present study was C. albicans followed by P. mirabilis, S. aureus, E. coli, and T. mentagrophytes. The range of minimum inhibitory concentration of tested extracts was 0.039-0.625 mg/ml while minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration ranged from 0.078-1.25 mg/ml. Six extracts out of eleven tested showed same values of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration, while rest showed higher values of minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration. Highest total activity (120.51 ml/g) was observed for bound flavonoids of root against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. Results of the present investigation indicate that Lantana camara has good antimicrobial activity with low range of minimum inhibitory concentration hence can be exploited for future plant based antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (Provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling Provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of these voice prostheses. Over a 5-year period, implantation of a Provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. In total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. Out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. The most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was C. albicans, followed by C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The most frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. The mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. Dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. The longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. There is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the device life time.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections: prevalence  and risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the agents causing community-acquired urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and their resistance patterns and to investigate risk factors for ESBL production. MATERIAL/METHODS: Patients diagnosed at the Department of Infectious Diseases in the Cukurova University School of Medicine Hospital with CAUTI between January 2006 and April 2007 were included prospectively. Patient data were recorded and the microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns were evaluated by the university's central microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total 146 patients with CAUTIs, 109 women and 37 men (mean age: 50.9+/-18.44 years), were included in the study. The most common infectious agents were Escherichia coli (76.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Proteus mirabilis (4.1%), and Enterococcus spp. (1.6%). The ciprofloxacin resistance rate for E. coli was 35% and resistance to TMP-SMZ 43%, whereas amikacin resistance was substantially low (3%). Four of 12 K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 2 to TMP-SMZ. Resistance to amikacin was not found in the K. pneumoniae strains. ESBL production was identified in 25 of the 112 E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. A history of a UTI within the last 6 months (p=0.029) and a history of frequent UTI (p=0.028) were found to be significant risk factors for ESBL production by univariate analysis. The only independent risk factor was a history of urinary system infection in the past 6 months (p=0.025) according to multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These high resistance rates to antimicrobials and particularly the extremely high rate of ESBL production in CAUTI should be carefully considered.
TI  - Assessing the emergence of resistance: the absence of biological cost in vivo may compromise fosfomycin treatments for P. aeruginosa infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor used efficiently to treat uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. A very convenient feature of fosfomycin, among others, is that although the expected frequency of resistant mutants is high, the biological cost associated with mutation impedes an effective growth rate, and bacteria cannot offset the obstacles posed by host defenses or compete with sensitive bacteria. Due to the current scarcity of new antibiotics, fosfomycin has been proposed as an alternative treatment for other infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, whether fosfomycin resistance in P. aeruginosa provides a fitness cost still remains unknown. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We herein present experimental evidence to show that fosfomycin resistance cannot only emerge easily during treatment, but that it is also cost-free for P. aeruginosa. We also tested if, as has been reported for other species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, fosfomycin resistant strains are somewhat compromised in their virulence. As concerns colonization, persistence, lung damage, and lethality, we found no differences between the fosfomycin resistant mutant and its sensitive parental strain. The probability of acquisition in vitro of resistance to the combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics (tobramycin and imipenem) has also been studied. While the combination of fosfomycin with tobramycin makes improbable the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics when administered together, the combination of fosfomycin plus imipenem does not avoid the appearance of mutants resistant to both antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: We have reached the conclusion that the use of fosfomycin for P. aeruginosa infections, even in combined therapy, might not be as promising as expected. This study should encourage the scientific community to assess the in vivo cost of resistance for specific antibiotic-bacterial species combinations, and therefore avoid reaching universal conclusions from single model organisms.
TI  - [Characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. To assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients, in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. Of these, 106 came from patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. The sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using ROC curves. RESULTS: Positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. Within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (MMC) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). The microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was Escherichia coli, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. In the ICU subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was Enterococcus faecalis, followed by Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. Specificity was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the ICU group. The groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with MMC and spinal cord injuries. Sensitivity and specificity (as measured using ROC curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).
TI  - Recovery and screening for antibiotic susceptibility of potential bacterial pathogens from the oral cavity of shark species involved in attacks on humans in Recife, Brazil.
AB  - The number of incidents involving sharks and humans at beaches in Recife, on the  north-eastern Brazilian coast, is among the highest worldwide. In addition, wound infections in survivors are common; but the nature and risk of the aetiological agents is unknown. In the present study, 81 potential bacterial pathogens were identified in the oral cavity of sharks involved in attacks in Recife, and were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests using the standardized disc-diffusion method. The majority were enterobacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Escherichia coli, Moellerella wisconcensis and Leclercia adecarboxylata. Other Gram-negative bacteria included Vibrio spp., Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. In addition, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Micrococcus spp. were identified, besides Streptococcus spp. from the viridans group. Resistance was especially found in the Proteus mirabilis and Citrobacter freundii, and ranged from 4 to 6 antibiotics out of the 13 tested. Gentamicin and vancomycin were the most effective against Gram-positive cocci strains, whereas levofloxacin was fully inhibitory against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These data are discussed in light of a retrospective evaluation of the medical records of three shark victims treated at Restauracao Hospital in Recife.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Loss of the waaL O-antigen ligase prevents surface activation of the flagellar gene cascade in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative bacterium that undergoes a physical and biochemical change from a vegetative swimmer cell (a typical Gram-negative rod) to an elongated swarmer cell when grown on a solid surface. In this study, we report that a transposon insertion in the waaL gene, encoding O-antigen ligase, blocked swarming motility on solid surfaces but had little effect on swimming motility in soft agar. The waaL mutant was unable to differentiate into a swarmer cell. Differentiation was also prevented by a mutation in wzz, encoding a chain length determinant for O antigen, but not by a mutation in wzyE, encoding an enzyme that polymerizes enterobacterial common antigen, a surface polysaccharide different from the lipid A::core. In wild-type P. mirabilis, increased expression of the flhDC operon occurs after growth on solid surfaces and is required for the high-level expression of flagellin that is characteristic of swarmer cells. However, in both the waaL and the wzz mutants, the flhDC operon was not activated during growth on agar. A loss-of-function mutation in the rcsB response regulator or overexpression of flhDC restored swarming to the waaL mutant, despite the absence of O antigen. Therefore, although O antigen may serve a role in swarming by promoting wettability, the loss of O antigen blocks a regulatory pathway that links surface contact with the upregulation of flhDC expression.
TI  - Distinct bacterial colonization patterns of Escherichia coli subtypes associate with rheumatoid factor status in early inflammatory arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of RA is unknown; however, bacterial exposure, particularly to Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, has been linked to disease pathogenesis. The strongest association was observed for RF(+) RA. We compare colonization patterns of these bacteria, and the anti-bacterial antibody levels in early onset RF(+) and RF(-) inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: Bacteria isolated from stool and urine of early-stage RF(+) and RF(-) patients recruited to the Early Arthritis Registry were biochemically identified and genotyped. IgM and IgA anti-bacterial and RF antibodies were assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: Differences in the types of colonizing pathogenic E. coli were identified. RF(+) patients were more commonly colonized with phylogenetic Group D E. coli, whereas RF(-) patients were more commonly colonized with phylogenetic Group B2 E. coli and these individuals also had lower joint scores and inflammatory markers yet higher IgA anti-E. coli antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: These studies link the type of colonizing bacteria in the gut and urine with the immune response (anti-bacterial and RF) in early-onset inflammatory arthritis and provide evidence for a role of the host-pathogen response in the aetiology of RF.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - An assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using Lucilia sericata Meigen as the marker species.
AB  - The relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (ES) from two carrion-feeding insects, Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Dermestes maculatus DeGeer, and a detritivore, Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, were compared to that of Lucilia sericata Meigen, a species with ES of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. Viable counts were used to assess time-kill of ES against five bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although T. molitor and D. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of P. mirabilis. The blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The larval ES from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of potency varied between the four species. These differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. Overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using L. sericata.
TI  - Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase Detection in Gram-negative Bacilli of Nosocomial Origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. The presence of ESBL producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from June 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection. The isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. Gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for ESBL by double disc synergy test (DDST- a screening test)and then phenotypic confirmatory test. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: From the sample of 238 gram-negative bacilli, we isolated Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter cloacae. Following both methods, 34% isolates were ESBL-positive. The ESBL producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-ESBL producers. Multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in ESBL positive isolates than non-ESBL isolates (21.66%). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of ESBL in our hospital cannot be ignored. ESBL producers can be detected by DDST and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. The sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. We recommend DDST using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.
TI  - Photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric UTIs.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toluidine blue (TB), methylene blue (MB), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical UTI-implicated pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm LED-illuminated conditions. TB and MB were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with the other compounds. Trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except Pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ALA required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: TB and MB were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. The photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide interaction is decisive for the activity of the antimicrobial  peptide NK-2 against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Phosphatidylglycerol is a widely used mimetic to study the effects of AMPs (antimicrobial peptides) on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. However, the antibacterial activities of novel NK-2-derived AMPs could not be sufficiently explained by using this simple model system. Since the LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-containing outer membrane is the first barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, in the present study we investigated interactions of NK-2 and a shortened variant with viable Escherichia coli WBB01 and Proteus mirabilis R45, and with model membranes composed of LPS isolated from these two strains. Differences in net charge and charge distribution of the two LPS have been proposed to be responsible for the differential sensitivity of the respective bacteria to other AMPs. As imaged by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and AFM (atomic force microscopy), NK-2-mediated killing of these bacteria was corroborated by structural alterations of the outer and inner membranes, the release of E. coli cytoplasma, and the formation of unique fibrous structures inside P. mirabilis, suggesting distinct and novel intracellular targets. NK-2 bound to and intercalated into LPS bilayers, and eventually induced the formation of transient heterogeneous lesions in planar lipid bilayers. However, the discriminative activity of NK-2 against the two bacterial strains was independent of membrane intercalation and lesion formation, which both were indistinguishable for the two LPS. Instead, differences in activity originated from the LPS-binding step, which could be demonstrated by NK-2 attachment to intact bacteria, and to solid-supported LPS bilayers on a surface acoustic wave biosensor.
TI  - Notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  - Anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. This could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. This study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and 65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. The floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.7%), Escherichia coli (1.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus 12.4% and Peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), Bacteroides (12.4%), Clostridium (3.8%), Fusobacterium (2.9%) and Propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. In 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only Aspergillus, in association with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, was identified. The study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Microbial evaluation and deterioration of paints and paint-products.
AB  - The microbial quality of materials and final products of a reputable paint industry in Lagos area were analysed. The bacterial contaminants isolated in the paint-products included Bacillus brevis, B. polymyxa, B. laterosporus, Lactobacillus gasseri, L. brevis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The fungal contaminants detected in the paints were mainly Aspergillus niger, A. flavus and Penicillium citrinum. The microbial populations in the raw materials ranged from 1.0 x 10(6) - 9.5 x 10(6) cfu g(-1) for bacteria and between 1.25 x 10(4) and 6.8 x 10(4) cfu g(-1) for fungi while those present in packaging materials ranged from 3.45 x 10(6) - 7.65 x 10(6) cfu g(-1) for bacteria and 2.4 x 10(3) - 2.8 x 10(3) cfu g(-1) for fungi respectively. The bacterial populations in the fresh paint samples monitored every two weeks from the time of production ranged from 1.6 x 10(1) - 4.7 x 10(5) cfu ml(-1) while the fungal populations ranged from 1.0 x 10(1) - 5.5 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) over a ten-month study period. The optical density at 600 nm increased while transmittance, pH, specific gravity and viscosity of the paint samples decreased over the period suggesting gradual deterioration of the aesthetic qualities of the paint-products with time as indicated by the measured parameters.
TI  - Use of the cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in AmpC co-producing bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) may not always be detected  in routine susceptibility tests. This study reports the performance of the cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest for the detection of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae, including those producing AmpC enzyme. METHODOLOGY: Consecutive non-duplicate isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from bloodstream infections from January to June 2008 were tested for ESBL by both the standard CLSI double-disk diffusion method using ceftazidime and cefotaxime disks and Etests using ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate, cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanate and cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate gradients. Isolates were also tested for the presence of transferable AmpC beta-lactamase by AmpC disk test and the efficacies of the different Etests in detecting ESBL production were compared. RESULTS: A total of 113 bacterial isolates (61 K. pneumoniae, 50 E. coli, and 2 P. mirabilis) were recovered. Respectively, 42 (37.2%) and 55 (48.7%) isolates were positive for ESBL by the ceftazidime-clavulanate and cefotaxime-clavulanate combined disk tests. The cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate Etest strip detected the maximum number of isolates (70/113, 61.9 %) as ESBL-positive compared to the ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate and cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanate strips, which detected 57 (50.4%) isolates each as ESBL-positive. All three ESBL Etest strips were equally effective in detecting ESBL in the isolates that were AmpC negative. In the 66 (58.4%) isolates that co-produced AmpC in addition to the ESBL enzymes, cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate Etest strip detected ESBL in an additional 13 (11.4%) isolates as compared to the other ESBL Etest strips. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest is a suitable substitute to test for ESBL production, especially in organisms producing AmpC beta-lactamases.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in patients with travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  - The identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ESBL-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. Patients with travellers' diarrhoea (N = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia or Campylobacter, were also examined for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The overall prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). Of the patients who had travelled in Europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be ESBL carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside Europe. ESBL-producing E. coli was especially common among patients returning from India (11/14), Egypt (19/38; 50%) and Thailand (8/38; 22%). In total, 90% of the genes of the ESBL-positive samples were of CTX-M type. The CTX-M-1 group dominated, followed by the CTX-M-9 group. The repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the ESBL strains found. Patients who have travelled outside Europe are at high risk of being colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - Severe renal failure in acute bacterial pyelonephritis: do not forget corticosteroids.
AB  - Acute renal failure (ARF) is a rare complication of acute pyelonephritis in adult immunocompetent patients. Recovery of renal function usually occurs if antibiotics are promptly initiated. However, long-term consequences of renal scarring due to acute pyelonephritis are probably underestimated, and some patients present with prolonged renal failure despite adequate antibiotic therapy. We report two cases of severe ARF complicating bacterial pyelonephritis successfully treated with corticosteroids in association with conventional antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial intra-abdominal infections--new treatment  options with tygecycline].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial, intra-abdominal infections are extremely serious conditions, considering possibilities for their early diagnosis, as well as for their effective therapy. Multiresistant bacteria (Enterobacteriacae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - ESBL Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) are frequently isolated as pathogens of these infections. Tygecycline is among the novel wide- spectrum antibiotics affecting multiresistant bacteria, which are being introduced in clinical practice. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess actual sensitivity of tygecycline to the commonest pathogens of intra-abdominal infections, generated in hospitalized surgical patients. Based on the sensitivity tests, tygecycline was indicated for targeted antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections. METHODS: Sensitivity to tygecycline, aminopenicillins, fluorochinoloni and gentamycine was established for the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonie, Enterobacter cloacea, Proteus mirabilis. Sensitivity to oxacillin, clincamycine and tygecycline was tested in Staphylococcus aureus, and to fluorochinolini, gentamycine and tygecycline in Enterococcus faecalis, and to fluorochinoloni, gentamycine, ceftazidime and gentamycine in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on the sensitivity results, tygecycline was administered in two patients with postsurgical intra-abdominal infections caused by ESBL Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonie. The initital dose of tygecycline was 100 mg i.v., followed by tygecycline 50 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 7 days. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria showed 98-100% sensitivity to tygecycline, except Psudomonas aeruginosa, where 100% resistance was demonstrated. Targeted antimicrobial medication with tygecycline proved effective in postoperative nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, the both concerned patients recovered. CONCLUSION: The choice of antimicrobial medication in nosocomial intra-abdominal infections requires through evaluation considering various factors including prior antibiotic therapy, co-morbidities and the current status of sensitivity with respect to potential multiresistant pathogens. Tygecycline shows significant in vitro efficacy against resistant gram-positive and key gram-negative facultative bacteria, which are a common cause of intra-abdominal infections in surgery patients. Clinical experience has shown that tygecycline is safe and effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates from the Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS), 2003-2008.
AB  - The Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS) programme was initiated in 2003 with the aim of monitoring the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli in China. From 2003 to 2008, a total of 3892 isolates were collected from 10 teaching hospitals. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. During the study period, a marked decrease in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp. to meropenem and imipenem was noticed, from 94.6% to 60.7% and from 92.5% to 62.1%, respectively. However, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa the susceptibility was relatively stable, with susceptibility rates of 86.2% to 76.0% for meropenem and 74.8% to 70.5% for imipenem. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited the highest activities against enterobacterial organisms, with ranges of MIC(90) values (MIC for 90% of the organisms) from 0.064mg/L to 0.25mg/L and 0.25 to 4mg/L, respectively. Except for Acinetobacter spp., the next most active agent against the majority of isolates was amikacin, with susceptibility ranging from 78.8% to 93.3%, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam (73.7% to 98.2%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (63.9% to 99.1%), cefepime (67.0% to 95.4%) and ceftazidime (54.5% to 93.3%). The percentage of isolates positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis ranged from 50.9% to 66.7%, 25.4% to 42.4% and 8.9% to 24.2%, respectively. These CMSS results have demonstrated increasing resistance of Acinetobacter spp. to carbapenems, resulting from the spread of highly resistant clones. Continued surveillance studies, including CMSS, as well as potent measures for controlling the spread of resistant clones are required.
TI  - Microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.
TI  - The influence of omentectomy on bacterial clearance: an experimental study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of an omentectomy on peritoneal defense mechanisms and  its clinical consequences have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of omentectomy on bacterial growth in blood and tissue specimen cultures in rats with experimental peritonitis. METHODS: Fifty Wistar-Albino rats were included in the present study. Animals were assigned into five groups as follow: Group 1 (n = 10), omentectomy alone; Group 2 (n = 10), omentectomy + bacterial peritonitis; Group 3 (n = 10), bacterial peritonitis alone; Group 4 (n = 10), laparotomy alone; and Group 5 (n = 10), sham group. Culture positivity rate and bacterial growth (colony forming units [CFU]/gram tissue) were assessed in mesenteric lymphoid tissue and venous blood of all animals. RESULTS: Bacterial growth in lymphoid tissue was significantly higher in Groups 2 and 3 than others (both, p < 0.05). CFU of Escherichia coli in lymphoid tissue was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Groups 1 and 3 (both, p < 0.05/4). Blood culture positivity was significantly higher in Group 2 than the others (both, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The omentum has an important role in the host peritoneal defense system. Peritoneal infection may pursue a more severe course with increased bacterial entrance into the blood in the absence of the omentum.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates to fosfomycin.
AB  - The advancing antimicrobial drug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae renders the  evaluation of potential novel therapeutic options necessary. We sought to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility to fosfomycin and 12 additional antibiotics of MDR Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected between November 2007 and April 2009 at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, was examined using the Etest method. A total of 152 MDR Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (76.3%), Escherichia coli (17.1%), Proteus mirabilis (4.6%) and other species (2.0%). Antimicrobial susceptibility rates were highest for fosfomycin (92.8%), tigecycline (92.1%) and colistin (73.0%) followed by imipenem (35.5%), tetracycline (20.4%), gentamicin (19.7%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5%) and ciprofloxacin (10.5%). Of the 152 isolates, 85 (55.9%) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR), of which 78 (91.8%) remained susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility to fosfomycin of the 79 carbapenemase-producing, 34 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and 24 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates was 94.9%, 94.1% and 83.3%, respectively. In conclusion, in this study fosfomycin exhibited good in vitro antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR Enterobacteriaceae. We suggest further evaluation of the potential clinical utility of fosfomycin against infections caused by these pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and Tris-EDTA.
AB  - Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA (Otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated with canine otitis. The microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. The most susceptible group included Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Malassezia pachydermatis, Streptococcus canis and Corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (MBC = 23/0.8 microg/mL of chlorhexidine/Tris-EDTA). The most resistant organism was Proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (MBC = 375/12 microg/mL). Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate MBCs ranging between 188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/mL. Interestingly, S. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than S. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. Although the concentrations required for killing (MBCs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.
TI  - Transfer of a phage T4 gene into Enterobacteriaceae, determined at the single-cell level.
AB  - The transfer range of phage genes was investigated at the single-cell level by using an in situ DNA amplification technique. After absorption of phages, a phage T4 gene was maintained in the genomes of non-plaque-forming bacteria at frequencies of 10(-2) gene copies per cell. The gene transfer decreased the mutation frequencies in nonhost recipients.
TI  - Microbiological findings in prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to define the most common causes, symptoms and clinical  features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls, and to evaluate treatment success depending on the causative agent involved. The study included 115 girls aged 2-8 (mean 4.8) years, presenting with vulvovaginitis to the Outpatient Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, Zagreb Children's Hospital, between September 2006 and July 2007. Medical history data were obtained from parents. Vaginal samples were collected for microbiological culture by using cotton-tipped swabs moistened with saline. All samples were referred to microbiology laboratory, where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. Selective and non-selective media were used. Of 115 study patients, 43 (37.4%) had received antibiotic therapy more than one month prior to their visit to the Clinic, mainly for upper respiratory tract infection. The most common presenting symptom was increased vaginal discharge usually noticed on the pants or diaper, found in 26 of 115 (22.6%) patients, followed by vulvar redness in 16 (13.9%), burning in seven (6.1%), itching in the vulvovaginal area in seven (6.1%), soreness in six (5.2%), odor in three (2.6%) patients, and two or more of these symptoms in another 50 (43.5%) patients. Fifty-nine of 115 children had normal clinical finding on gynecologic examination. Among the remaining 56 children, the most common finding was erythema observed in 19, vaginal discharge in ten, and a combination of discharge and erythema in 13 patients. Of 115 study patients, causative agents were isolated from vaginal culture in 38 (33%) cases. Of these, 21 grew group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, five patients Haemophilus influenzae, three Escherichia coli, two Enterococcus spp., and one each Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 31 of these 38 patients, except for those cases where intestinal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated and topical therapy and hygienic measures were applied alone. Accordingly, vulvovaginitis in girls was most commonly caused by pathogens originating from the patient upper respiratory tract, accompanied by the symptoms of redness and vaginal discharge. In these cases, antibiotic treatment was administered. In the majority of prepubertal girls with either vulvitis or normal genital finding, simple measures to improve hygiene will lead to resolution of all symptoms.
TI  - Nosocomial infections prevalence study in a Serbian university hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Nosocomial infections (NI) are a serious health problem resulting in an enromous burden of excess morbidity and mortaliti rates, and health care costs. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of NI and to identify groups of patients at special risk for NI in the University Clinical Center, Kragujevac, Serbia. METHODS: A period prevalence study design was used in this study. A survey of NI included all patients hospitalized in all departments in the University Clinical Center, Kragujevac. RESULTS: Among 764 patients surveyed, the global prevalence rate of patients with at least one NI was 6.2% (95% CI = 5.6-6.8), while the prevalence of NI was 7.1%. The most frequent infections were surgical site infections (14.1%; 95% CI = 12.9-15.3), followed by pneumonia (2.3%; 95% CI = 2.1-2.5) in surgical patients. In medical wards, the most common NI were skin and subcutaneous tissue infections (1.6%; 95% CI = 1.4-1.8), and urinary infections (1.4%; 95% CI = 1.3-1.5). Overall, 85.1% NI were culture-proven; the leading pathogens were Pseudomonas species (40.0%), followed by Staphylococcus species (25.0%), Escherichia coli (22.5%), Proteus mirabilis (17.5%) and Klebsiella-Enterobacter (12.5%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified 3 risk factors independently associated with NI appearance: hospital stay > or =8 days (p = 0.0015), urinary catheter (p = 0.0022) and antibiotic use (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that NI are a serious health problem in our hospital. The most common infections were surgical site infections, followed by skin and subcutaneous tissue infection and urinary tract infections. Nosocomial infections were most common in patients in urological and orthopedic departments, and then in intensive care units. Prolonged hospital stay, urinary catheter and antibiotic exposure were risk factors independently associated with NI appearance.
TI  - International spread and persistence of TEM-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an IncA/C2 plasmid containing Tn1696::Tn1 and IS5075-Tn21.
AB  - TEM-24 remains one of the most widespread TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae. To analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative TEM-24 producers from Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain (13 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 Escherichia coli isolates, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 Proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). Clonal relatedness (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and E. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. Plasmid analysis included determination of the incompatibility group (by PCR, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (Tn3, Tn21, and Tn402). Similar PFGE patterns were identified among E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, while E. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups A, B2, and D). Highly related 180-kb IncA/C2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. Each plasmid contained defective In0-Tn402 (dfrA1-aadA1, aacA4, or aacA4-aacC1-orfE-aadA2-cmlA1) and In4-Tn402 (aacA4 or dfrA1-aadA1) variants. These integrons were located within Tn21, Tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with IS5075 interrupting their IRtnp and IRmer. In all cases, blaTEM-24 was part of an IS5075-DeltaTn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blaTEM-2 and blaTEM-3 variants. The international dissemination of TEM-24 is fuelled by an IncA/C2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. This work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of TEM-2 ESBL derivatives.
TI  - Electrostatic binding of substituted metal phthalocyanines to enterobacterial cells: its role in photodynamic inactivation.
AB  - The effect of ionic substituents in zinc and aluminum phthalocyanine molecules and of membrane surface charge on the interaction of dyes with artificial membranes and enterobacterial cells, as well as on photosensitization efficiency was studied. It has been shown that increasing the number of positively charged substituents enhances the extent of phthalocyanine binding to Escherichia coli cells. This, along with the high quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, determines efficient photodynamic inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria by zinc and aluminum octacationic phthalocyanines. The effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations and pH on photodynamic inactivation of enterobacteria in the presence of octacationic zinc phthalocyanine has been studied. It has been shown that effects resulting in lowering negative charge on outer membrane protect bacteria against photoinactivation, which confirms the crucial role in this process of the electrostatic interaction of the photosensitizer with the cell wall. Electrostatic nature of binding is consistent with mainly electrostatic character of dye interactions with artificial membranes of different composition. Lower sensitivity of Proteus mirabilis to photodynamic inactivation, compared to that of E. coli and Salmonella enteritidis, due to low affinity of the cationic dye to the cells of this species, was found.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Clinical aspects and epidemiology of uncomplicated cystitis in women. German results of the ARESC Study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uncomplicated cystitis in women is among the most frequent infections  in the community setting. The German results of the international ARESC Study are reported concerning clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and investigated clinically including urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested for nine antimicrobials RESULTS: In Germany a total of 442 patients were enrolled and 412 were eligible. A positive urine culture (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) was found in 335 (81.3%); 325 (97.1%) of them had a monoinfection. A total of 317 uropathogens were further analyzed in a central laboratory (Genua). Escherichia coli was the most frequent (76.7%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (4.7%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.5%), enterococci (2.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (97.9%) followed by mecillinam (97.5%), nitrofurantoin (95.4%), and ciprofloxacin (95.4%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (59.2%) followed by cotrimoxazole (74.0%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.1%), mecillinam (97.5%), ciprofloxacin (92.3%), and nitrofurantoin (86.3%). The lowest rates were found again for ampicillin (56.6%) and cotrimoxazole (73.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Fosfomycin, mecillinam (not available in Germany), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. Because of increasing resistance rates cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim) and fluoroquinolones are generally not recommended as first-choice drugs for empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the metal ion-dependent L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase encoded by bacteriophage T5.
AB  - Although bacteriophage T5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. This is the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage T5 lytic hydrolase. The endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage T5 was cloned in Escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). The protein purified was shown to be an L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase. The enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mM) at pH 8.5. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by EDTA and BAPTA, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. It was found that, along with E. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage T5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other Gram-negative microorganisms (Pectobacterium carotovorum, Pseudomonas putida, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis). This endolysin is the first example of an L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting Gram-negative bacteria. There are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage T5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of endolytic L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. The article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.
TI  - Tensile strength of absorbable suture materials: in vitro analysis of the effects of pH and bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the tensile strength and suture degradation of 5 commonly  used absorbable suture materials in different pH and bacteria inoculated media. DESIGN: In vitro study of the tensile strength as well as the effect of pH and bacteria on suture degradation for 5 common absorbable suture materials. SETTING: Surgical and Orthopaedics Research Laboratories in Prince of Wales Hospital, New South Wales (Tertiary Hospital/University of New South Wales, Australia). PARTICIPANTS: Chromic catgut, Vicryl, Caprosyn, Bio-Syn, and Maxon were immersed in sterile urine (control), Escherichia coli (E coli) medium, Proteus mirabilis medium (basic medium with pH of 7.8), and acidic medium with pH 5.6. The tensile strength and suture stability were analyzed after immersion in these media after 1, 7, 14, and 28 days. Three runs of test were performed using the universal tensile strength analyzer Mini Bionix (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, Minnesota), and statistical tests were performed on these results. RESULTS: A decrease in suture tensile strength was noted in all 5 sutures with the Maxon suture showing the least deterioration followed by the Vicryl suture. A 1-way analysis of variance test revealed a statistically significant decrease in suture tensile strength over the days of testing, and a post hoc Tukey test confirmed a significant decrease up to day 7 (p < 0.01). The presence of E coli and higher urine pH lead to greater suture degradation, but these were not statistically significant. Linear regression model univariate analysis showed that time contributed to the most significant decrease in tensile strength followed by the types of suture materials tested. The types of media tested were not a significant predictor of tensile strength by itself. CONCLUSIONS: The Maxon suture showed greater suture tensile strength when compared with other sutures. The presence of pH and bacteria caused variable rates of suture degradation, but the result was not significant.
TI  - Comparison of 3 phenotypic-detection methods for identifying plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PABLs) have been detected in the strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. PABLs may be difficult to detect and might interfere in the therapeutic and infection-control processes. Although several PABL-detection methods based on phenotypes have been reported, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute currently does not recommend a routine detection method for PABLs. The aim of this study is to compare the performances of 3 phenotypic PABL detection methods. METHODS: Total 276 non-duplicated clinical isolates of E. coli (N=97), K. pneumoniae (N=136), and P. mirabilis (N=43) were collected from 14 hospitals in Korea between April and June 2007 in a non-consecutive and non-random manner. Multiplex PCR was performed to detect the PABL genes. Further, 3 phenotypic detection methods-cephamycin-Hodge test, Tris-EDTA (TE) disk test, and combination-disk test with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (BA)-were performed using cefoxitin and cefotetan disks. RESULTS: PABL genes were detected by multiplex PCR in 122/276 isolates, including 14/97 E. coli, 105/136 K. pneumoniae, and 3/43 P. mirabilis isolates. The combination-disk test with BA showed higher sensitivity (98.4%), specificity (92.2%), and efficiency (96.3%) than the cephamycin-Hodge (76.2%, 96.1%, and 88.6%, respectively) and the TE-disk (80.3%, 91.6%, and 87.9%, respectively) tests. CONCLUSIONS: The combination-disk test with BA is a simple, efficient, and interpretable test that can be applicable in clinical laboratories involved in the detection of PABLs in clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Justification for the use of Ocimum gratissimum L in herbal medicine and its interaction with disc antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ethanolic extract of the leaves of Ocimium gratisimum L. (Lamiaceae), used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments such as urinary tract, wound, skin and gastrointestinal infections, was evaluated for its antibacterial properties against four clinical bacteria isolates namely: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the antifungal properties using a clinical isolate of Candida albicans. A typed bacterium of Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and another typed fungal strain of Candida albicans (ATCC 90028) were also included. The study also intended to verify if the concomitant administration of conventional antibiotics with Ocimium gratisimum which is normally taken as food (spice) will negatively affect its activity. METHODS: The agar diffusion method was used to test the in vitro activity of the plant extract. The interaction of the plant extract with some disc antibiotics namely: ciprofloxacin, septrin, streptomycin, ampicillin, nystatin and ketoconazole was tested using the agar overlay inoculum susceptibility disc method. Phytochemical analysis of the extract was performed following established methods. RESULTS: The extract showed good but varying in vitro activities against all the isolates tested. While ampicillin showed synergistic interaction with the plant extract against clinical isolates of E. coli and P. mirabilis, septrin was synergistic against the clinical isolate of E. coli only. Similarly, the activity of the extract against C. albicans isolate was synergistic with ketoconazole and nystatin. CONCLUSION: The study has validated the folkloric use of O. gratissimum in traditional medicinal practice and goes further to show that the use of this plant material as food spice may not really threaten the efficacy of some conventional antibiotics that may have been taken concomitantly with it as is the popular belief in the practice of herbal medicine in local/rural communities of many countries in the world.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - Invasive bacteria isolates from children with severe infections in a Nigerian hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available about the aetiology and epidemiology  of serious bacterial infections in Nigeria. This study determined bacterial isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children presenting in the emergency room of a teaching hospital in Nigeria. METHOD: From October 2005 to December 2006, children aged two to 60 months presenting with signs of acute systemic infections were recruited. Blood culture and CSF specimens were collected and processed using standard microbiological protocols. Data were analysed using SPSS version 11 software. RESULTS: Two hundred and two blood and 69 CSF samples were cultured. Fifty-five (27%) of the blood cultures yielded Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci in almost equal proportions. The most common isolates from the blood cultures were Staphylococcus aureus, 26 (12.9%) and atypical coliforms, 13 (6.5%). Others are Klebsiella spp, 3 (1.5%); Klebsiella pneumonia, 2 (1.0%); Escherichia coli, 3 (1.5%); Enterobacter agglomerans, 2 (1.1%); Proteus mirabilis, 2(1%); Pseudomonas spp, 2 (1.0%); Haemophilus influenza, 1 (1.0%); and Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 1 (1.0%). Fourteen out of 67 (20.9%) of the CSF samples yielded bacterial isolates: Streptococcus pneumonia, 3 (4.5%); Haemophilus influenza, 8 (11.9%); Hemophilus spp, 1 (1.5%); E. Coli, 1 (1.5%); and atypical coliform, 1 (1.5%). Gram-negative coliform isolates were predominantly resistant to penicillin based antibiotics and co-trimoxazole but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. A high percentage of S. aureus isolates were multi-drug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections contribute to the significant morbidity among children in our environment. S. aureus was more frequently isolated in sepsis while H. influenzae appears to play a major role in meningitis. Appropriate use of antibiotics is needed to manage affected children effectively. We also recommend improved vaccine coverage of children under the age of five years.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - [A very extensive necrotizing fasciitis].
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe skin infection. Fluidized bed may be indicated  to improve healing. We report a 36-year-old woman case, who developed an important skin emphysema on a fluidized bed that may have worsen the situation.
TI  - Significance of cytomorphological and microbiological examination of bile collected by endoscopic cannulation of the papilla of vater.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bile analysis yields important information such as "biliary microlithiasis" and biliary tract colonization by microorganisms like Salmonella typhi or paratyphi, Escherichia coli, etc., which may progresses to cholelithiasis and have been found to have a role in the development of gallbladder cancer in India. AIM: To perform microscopic, cytomorphological and microbiological examination of bile collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with benign and malignant lesions of the gallbladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bile was collected from 48 patients by a catheter inserted through the cystic duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Direct microscopy and grading of crystals was performed. Smears prepared from centrifuged deposits were stained with Giemsa, Papanicolaou stain and Gram's stain for cytological and microbiological examination. Special staining for Helicobacter pylori was performed using Loeffler's Methylene blue and Warthin Starry stain. The rest of the sample was used for culture and complete microbiological examination. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had inflammatory lesions while 12 had malignant lesions. Crystals were observed in 93% of the cases, 13 (28.8%) had only cholesterol crystals, three (6.6%) had bilirubinate and 29 (64.4%) had both cholesterol and bilirubinate crystals. Smears from the centrifuged deposit mainly showed coccoid or cocobacillary bacteria on Gram's staining (81.3%). Five of 12 (41.6%) malignant cases showed epithelial atypia while none of the benign or inflammatory lesions showed such a change in hematoxylin and eosin and Pap-stained smears. Microbiologic analysis showed Staphylococcus aureus (14%), S. saprophyticus (5.5%), Peptococcus (5.5%), Peptostreptococcus (5.5%), Proteus mirabilis (5.5%), E. coli (17%), Enteorbacter cloacae (5.5%) and H. pylori (2.8%). CONCLUSION: Complete microscopic and microbiological examination of bile directly obtained from the common bile duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography yielded good results as fresh samples could be analyzed. It may help in diagnosis of many gallbladder lesions in early stages, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Research of urinary tract infections in family medicine physicians' offices--empiric antimicrobial therapy of urinary tract infections--Croatian experience.
AB  - In the period between October 1st and November 30th, 2006, we investigated a total of 3188 episodes of UTI (802 among males; 2386 among females) recorded in 108 family medicine offices in 20 cities in Croatia. The most common UTIs in women were acute uncomplicated cystitis (62%), complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (14%), urethritis (9%), acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (6%), recurrent cystitis (5%), asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%) and recurrent pyelonephritis. The most common UTIs in men were complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (48%), urethritis (25%), prostatitis (24%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%). Etiological diagnosis was made in 999 (31%) UTI episodes before antimicrobial therapy was given. The most frequently isolated causative pathogens were Escherichia coli (77%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), Klebsiella spp (3%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3%) and Enterobacter (1%). Antimicrobial drug was administered in 2939 (92.19%) UTI episodes, in 1940 (66.01%) as empirical therapy, and in 999 (34%) as targeted antimicrobial therapy. The most commonly administered drug in empirical therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent cystitis and urethritis in women was cephalexin, for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs in women co-amoxiclav, and for UTIs in males ciprofloxacin. The results of this research of 3188 UTI episodes in family medicine physicians' offices provide a confirmatory answer to question whether empirical antimicrobial therapy of UTI prescribed by Croatian family practitioners is in accordance with the national guidelines.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of new metronidazole and imidazole derivatives.
AB  - New imidazole ring derivatives comprising 1,3-oxazoline, Schiff's bases, thiadiazole, oxadiazole and 1,2,4-triazole moieties are reported. 3-Aminobiimidazol-4-one compounds 7a-c were synthesized by the reaction of compounds 6a-c with hydrazine hydrate. Biimidazole esters 9a-c were converted into biimidazole hydrazide esters 10a-c. Compounds 7a-c and 10a-c were converted into a variety of derivatives.
TI  - A multinational survey of risk factors for infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in nonhospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are increasing in frequency and are associated with high mortality rates. Circulation of CTX-M-type ESBLs in the community is of particular concern, because it may confound standard infection-control measures. METHODS: We analyzed the results of epidemiologic studies of infection caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in nonhospitalized patients from 6 centers in Europe, Asia, and North America. Risk factors for infection with an ESBL-producing organism were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 983 patient-specific isolates were reviewed (890 [90.5%] of which were Escherichia coli, 68 [6.9%] of which were Klebsiella species, and 25 [2.5%] of which were Proteus mirabilis); 339 [34.5%] of the isolates produced ESBLs. CTX-M types were the most frequent ESBLs (accounting for 65%). Rates of co-resistance to ciprofloxacin among ESBL-producing isolates were high (>70%), but significant variation was seen among centers with respect to rates of resistance to gentamicin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Similar risk factors for infection with an ESBL-producing organism were found in the different participating centers. Significant risk factors, identified by multivariate analysis, were recent antibiotic use, residence in a long-term care facility, recent hospitalization, age 65 years, and male sex (area under the receiver-operator characteristic [ROC] curve, 0.80). However, 34% of ESBL-producing isolates (115 of 336 isolates) were obtained from patients with no recent health care contact; the area under the ROC curve for the multivariate model for this group of patients was only 0.70, which indicated poorer predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are now prevalent worldwide, necessitating international collaboration. Novel approaches are required to adequately address issues such as empirical treatment for severe community-acquired infection and infection control.
TI  - Prevalence of CTX-M beta-lactamases in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
AB  - CTX-M beta-lactamases were thought to be rare in the United States, but a recent  study in Texas showed that up to 70% of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-containing members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were CTX-M positive (J. S. Lewis, M. Herrera, B. Wickes, J. E. Patterson, and J. H. Jorgensen, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 51:4015-4021, 2007). We used PCR to detect CTX-M in all 291 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria isolated in our laboratory during 2007. Thirty (48%) Escherichia coli isolates, 6 (3%) Klebsiella sp. isolates, and 7 (100%) Proteus mirabilis isolates tested were CTX-M positive, with 15% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested being positive. The E. coli CTX-M groups were I (57%), IV (37%), II (3%), and not groupable (3%); three of the group IV isolates were positive for CTX-M-18, and three of the group I isolates were positive for CTX-M-15. One of seven positive P. mirabilis isolates was in group II, with the remainder being positive for a CTX-M-25-like beta-lactamase; and 33% of the Klebsiella sp. isolates were in group I or IV, with the remainder not being in groups I to IV. CTX-M-producing bacteria were isolated from urine (n = 13), blood (n = 13), wounds (n = 12), and the respiratory tract (n = 4). All 31 CTX-M-positive isolates tested for the presence of ESBL were confirmed to produce ESBLs by the use of tests recommended by the CLSI. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of the CTX-M-positive isolates showed that six P. mirabilis isolates were clonal and that there were seven different E. coli clusters. Five of seven P. mirabilis isolates were from blood cultures. The CLSI tests for the confirmation of ESBL production reliably detect these isolates if both cefotaxime and ceftazidime are tested, but only about half would be classified as a possible CTX-M producers on the basis of the antibiogram alone. A new panprimer set increases the ability to detect CTX-M-producing strains. CTX-M-positive bacteria are common in our geographic region, are often invasive, and, with the exception of P. mirabilis, are multiclonal.
TI  - Epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative organisms recovered  from patients in a multistate network of long-term care facilities.
AB  - We identified 1,805 gram-negative organisms in cultures of urine samples obtained over a 10-month period from residents of 63 long-term care facilities. The prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli was 51% (446 of 874 isolates), whereas the prevalences of ceftazidime and imipenem resistance in Klebsiella species were 26% and 6% (84 and 19 of 323 isolates), respectively. The prevalence of resistance varied significantly by facility type, size, and geographic location.
TI  - High prevalence of bla(CTX-M-1)-group extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Emilia-Romagna, Italy.

TI  - Are sinus-track cultures reliable for identifying the causative agent in chronic  osteomyelitis?
AB  - PURPOSE: The infection of bone that contains bone marrow called osteomyelitis, and is caused by different microorganisms. In this study, we aimed to determine the diagnostic value and accuracy of cultures of material from a sinus track compared with those of cultures of bone specimens that have been controversial. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Prospective study was conducted at Hospital University of Dicle, a 1,090-bed university-based hospital located in Diyarbakir, Turkey. Between May 2005 and September 2006, sinus-track cultures were compared with those of bone cultures from 43 patients with chronic osteomyelitis. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 30.6 +/- 3.6 years, and 29 (67%) male and 14 (33%) female. Organisms isolated from bone cultures were Staphylococcus 69% (29/42), Escherichia coli 9.5% (4/42), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9.5% (4/42), Proteus mirabilis 7% (3/42), respectively. Cultures of sinus track and bone specimens gave identical results in 38% of patients. CONCLUSION: The value of bone culture in the therapy of osteomyelitis must be emphasized; it is the only reliable means of determining the responsible agent, up on which the antibiotic therapy is based. The correlation between sinus track and bone cultures was 38%, i.e., failure in the treatment for 6 patients out of 10.
TI  - The ARESC study: an international survey on the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens involved in uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The ARESC (Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiological Survey on Cystitis) study is  an international survey to investigate the prevalence and susceptibility of pathogens causing cystitis. Female patients (n=4264) aged 18-65 years with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled in nine European countries as well as Brazil during 2003-2006. Pathogens were identified and their susceptibility to nine antimicrobials was determined. Escherichia coli accounted for 76.7% of isolates. Among E. coli, 10.3% of the isolates were resistant to at last three different classes of antimicrobial agents. Resistance was most common to ampicillin (48.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29.4%) and nalidixic acid (18.6%). Fosfomycin, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin were the most active drugs (98.1%, 95.8% and 95.2% susceptible strains, respectively) followed by ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefuroxime (91.7%, 82.5% and 82.4%, respectively). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was >10% in Brazil, Spain, Italy and Russia. Overall, Proteus mirabilis were more susceptible to beta-lactams and less susceptible to non-beta-lactams than E. coli, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which are intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, were less susceptible to mecillinam (88.8%), fosfomycin (87.9%), cefuroxime (78.6%) and nitrofurantoin (17.7%). Resistance was rare in Staphylococcus saprophyticus, with the exception of ampicillin (36.4%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (10.2%). In Italy, Spain, Brazil and Russia, the countries most affected by antimicrobial resistance, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes (mainly CTX-M type) were detected in 48 strains (39 E. coli, 6 K. pneumoniae and 3 P. mirabilis). Despite wide intercountry variability in bacterial susceptibility rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin and mecillinam have preserved their in vitro activity in all countries investigated against the most common uropathogens.
TI  - Dependence of swarming in Escherichia coli K-12 on spermidine and the spermidine  importer.
AB  - In a previous work, it was observed that the swarming of polyamine-deficient Proteus mirabilis (speB::sm) was severely inhibited on Luria-Bertani (LB) swarming plates (LBSw) (LB, 0.5% glucose, 0.5% agar), and it was clarified that extracellular putrescine was important as a signaling molecule for the induction of swarming in P. mirabilis. However, a polyamine-deficient strain (delta-speAB delta-speC) of Escherichia coli swarmed as well as the parental strain on LBSw plates. We report that the swarming phenotype of a polyamine-deficient E. coli strain is dependent on spermidine and PotABCD, a spermidine importer.
TI  - An appraisal of current management of childhood urinary tract infections among private medical practitioners.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Private medical practitioners manage substantial number of children with urinary tract infection in Nigeria. It is important to evaluate the management of urinary tract infection (UTI), because of complications that may arise form improper treatment. METHODS: This study was conducted during the 10th Annual General and Scientific Conference of Guild of Medical Directors in Kano. Study populations were private medical practitioners. The research tools were self administered questionnaires containing questions to illicit knowledge, attitude and treatment regarding childhood UTI. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty respondents returned their questionnaire. There were 98 (81.7%) males and 22 (18.2%) females. Twenty one (17.5%) had postgraduate qualification. Majority (87.5%) respondents preferred early morning and mid-stream urine for patients. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were the commonest listed isolates. The knowledge of predisposing factors and complications following UTI was fair. Twenty-six percent would give chemoprophylaxis for repeat infections in females while only 7% would refer such patients to specialist. Reasons that warranted referral varied from inability to pay fees to the occurrence of complications in the course of therapy. Twenty-nine percent would use multiple therapy (antibiotics) because of the need to ensure adequate antimicrobial coverage, effective therapy and prevention of resistance and cost effectiveness. Ampicillin, Cotrimazole and Tetracycline featured as first line antibiotics among the respondents. CONCLUSION: Some practices are clearly at variance with recommendations. Continue medical education is recommended for bridging the gap between current practices, this will enhance patient's care.
TI  - Design and quality control of a pharmaceutical formulation containing natural products with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to determine the antibacterial and antifungal  activity as well as mutagenicity of Sechium edule fluid extract and to obtain a pharmaceutical formulation with them. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. isolated from clinical samples from two hospitals of Tucuman, Argentina. Non-toxicity and mutagenicity on both Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA 100 strains until 100 microg/plate were observed. A hydrogel with carbopol acrylic acid polymer containing S. edule fluid extract as antibacterial, antimycotic and antioxidant agent was obtained. Microbiological, physical and functional stability of pharmaceutical formulation conserved at room temperature for 1 year were determined. Addition of antioxidant preservatives to store the pharmaceutical formulation was not necessary. The semisolid system showed antimicrobial activity against all gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi assayed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 20 to 800 microg/mL. Its activity was compared with a pharmaceutical formulation containing commercial antibiotic and antifungal. A pseudoplastic behavior and positive thixotropy were observed. Our current finding shows an antimicrobial activity of hydrogel containing S. edule extract on a large range of gram negative and gram positive multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. This topical formulation may be used as antimycotic and as antibacterial in cutaneous infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Detection of AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp. and Proteus mirabilis in a regional clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - There are currently no standardized diagnostic tests available for the reliable detection of AmpC beta-lactamases in Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. A study was designed to evaluate a confirmation disk test using cefotetan (CTT) and cefoxitin (FOX) with phenylboronic acid (PBA). It also investigated the most suitable screening concentrations of FOX, ceftriaxone (CRO) and ceftazidime (CAZ) for the detection of AmpC beta-lactamases. A total of 126 control (consisting of 11 laboratory and 115 well-characterized clinical strains) and 29,840 non-repeat clinical isolates were included. FOX with PBA used in a confirmation test and CRO and CAZ as screening agents were found to be unreliable. FOX at >or= 32 mg/L was the best screening agent and CTT with PBA was the best confirmation test. Of the clinical isolates 635 (2%) were found to be resistant to cefoxitin (MIC >or= 32 ug/mL) and 332 (52%) were AmpC positive. E. coli was the most common organism with AmpC beta-lactamases and was mostly present in urines from community patients. It is recommended that laboratories use FOX at 32 mg/L as a screening agent and perform a disk test with CTT and PBA to confirm the presence of an AmpC cephalosporinase in isolates of Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Salmonella spp. and P. mirabilis. This approach is convenient, practical and easy to incorporate into the workflow of a clinical laboratory. False-positive AmpC detection may occur with KPC-producing bacteria when inhibitor-based methods are used.
TI  - Correlation between antibiotic consumption and bacterial resistance as quality indicator of proper use of these drugs in inpatients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Antibiotics are the most frequently used medications in Serbian hospitalized patients. Information about antibiotic utilization and sensitivity among inpatients in Serbia is scanty, and there are no available publications on the topic. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in the Clinical Center Nis, one of the biggest hospitals in Serbia. METHODS: The data on antibiotics use in inpatients were obtained from the database of the Department of Pharmacotherapy and expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days (DBD), during 2003-2007. Bacterial resistances were given as percentages of resistant isolates. RESULTS: During the investigation period, the overall consumption of antibiotics had a significant decrease in 2007, by 22.99% (62.23 : 47.92 DBD; p < 0.05). The most frequently used antibiotics were cephalosporins, followed by penicillins, aminoglycosides and quinolones. Hospital aminoglycosides consumption was reduced in 2007 to 59.9% (13.4 : 5.53 DBD) while the resistance to amikacin was reduced from 40.88% to 32.1%. However, utilization of ciprofloxacin had a significant increase in 2007 (120.7%). There was an alarming increase in the level of resistance to ciprofloxacin in our hospital (from 13.5% to 28.3% in Escherichia coli and from 11.1 to 30.09% in Proteus mirabilis). Reduction of E. coli resistant to amoxicillin+clavulanic acid correlated significantly with their utilization, while the resistance for all isolates decreased from 52.16% to 24.40%. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm an association between the use of antibiotics and the prevalence of resistance. This methodology could provide good quality indicators of rational drug use and serve for local monitoring of antibiotics use and resistance, as well as for external comparison.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - [Etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial susceptibility: a study conducted on a population of children hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics at Warsaw Bielany Hospital; 2004-2006].
AB  - BACKGROUND: the basis of urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis in children is based on positive results of microbiological tests. The selection of an antimicrobial drug for empirical treatment and prophylaxis of UTI is determined by the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from urine cultures. AIM: Determination of the etiology of urinary tract infections and drug sensitivity of the pathogen in hospitalized children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we performed quantitative analyses of 2522 urine cultures from children admitted to the Department of Paediatrics at Warsaw Bielany Hospital, from January 2004 to December 2006. We obtained 456 positive urinary cultures, which accounted for 18.1% of urinary samples (14.7%; 17.9%; 21.2% in successive years). RESULTS: in 392 (86%) cases the urinary infection was caused by one of the isolated pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. or Proteus mirabilis. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen (70-74%). We noted that the frequency of isolating of Klebsiella spp. grew from 6 to 10%, whereas that of Proteus mirabilis fell from 10 to 2% in the same years. Likewise, in the period from 2004-2006 we observed the same level of the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to nitrofurantoin (84-88%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (90-91%), whereas we observed a non-statistically significant lowering of susceptibility to aminopenicillins, and aminopenicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors (from 92 to 74%; p=0.2). There was a statistically significant decrease in drug susceptibility to nitrofurantoin (from 86 to 60%; p<0.05). However, because the groups of children treated with nitrofurantoin were small (6-8-11 in successive years) further studies are needed. CONCLUSION: studies into the etiology of UTI and drug susceptibility of the pathogens in hospitalized children could facilitate correct management of patients receiving empirical treatment and prophylaxis of UTI. Of concern is the noted decrease in the sensitivity of the most frequent pathogen, Escherichia coli, to aminopenicillins and aminopenicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors.
TI  - Integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices of orbifloxacin in beagle dogs after a single intravenous and intramuscular administration.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orbifloxacin were studied  in beagle dogs after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight. An absolute bioavailability of 100.1% +/- 4.76%, a terminal half-life of 4.23 +/- 0.2 h and 3.95 +/- 0.15 h after i.v. and i.m. administration, a steady-state volume of distribution of 1.61 +/- 0.13 liters/kg, and clearance of 0.31 +/- 0.03 liters/h/kg were observed. Orbifloxacin showed rapid, concentration-dependent killing against the Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, and Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates. Computations based on PK-PD analysis indicated that the recommended dose is unlikely to be clinically effective against some strains like S. intermedius. Therefore, a higher dose of orbifloxacin would be worthy of consideration for treatment of certain bacterial infections in dogs.
TI  - In vitro biological activity screening of Lycopodium complanatum L. ssp. chamaecyparissus (A. Br.) Doll.
AB  - This article reports the results of selected biological activities, including anticholinesterase, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, of the petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts as well as the alkaloid fraction of Lycopodium complanatum L. ssp. chamaecyparissus (A. Br.) Doll (LCC, Lycopodiaceae) growing in Turkey. Anticholinesterase effect of the extracts was tested against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay based on Ellman method. Antioxidant activity of the LCC extracts was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging method at 0.2 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of LCC exracts using Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney and Vero cell lines. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were screened against the bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the fungi: Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis. Only the petroleum ether extract of LCC possessed remarkable activity against both AChE and BChE at 1 mg mL(-1) (76.5 and 69.6%, respectively), whereas LCC extracts showed low free radical-scavenging activity. All of the extracts were found to be more effective against the ATCC strains than isolated ones, particularly S. aureus, while the extracts had moderate antifungal activity. On the other hand, we found that only the petroleum ether extract was active against HSV. In addition, we also analysed the content of the alkaloid fraction of the plant by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and identified lycopodine as the major alkaloid (60.8%).
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa Las quorum sensing autoinducer suppresses growth and biofilm production in Legionella species.
AB  - Bacteria commonly communicate with each other by a cell-to-cell signalling mechanism known as quorum sensing (QS). Recent studies have shown that the Las QS autoinducer N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa performs a variety of functions not only in intraspecies communication, but also in interspecies and interkingdom interactions. In this study, we report the effects of Pseudomonas 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL on the growth and suppression of virulence factors in other bacterial species that frequently co-exist with Ps. aeruginosa in nature. It was found that 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL, but not its analogues, suppressed the growth of Legionella pneumophila in a dose-dependent manner. However, 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL did not exhibit a growth-suppressive effect on Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes faecalis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. A concentration of 50 microM 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL completely inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila. Additionally, a significant suppression of biofilm formation was demonstrated in L. pneumophila exposed to 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL. Our results suggest that the Pseudomonas QS autoinducer 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL exerts both bacteriostatic and virulence factor-suppressive activities on L. pneumophila alone.
TI  - Lysozyme catalyzes the formation of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Hen egg white lysozyme acted as the sole reducing agent and catalyzed the formation of silver nanoparticles in the presence of light. Stable silver colloids formed after mixing lysozyme and silver acetate in methanol and the resulting nanoparticles were concentrated and transferred to aqueous solution without any significant changes in physical properties. Activity and antimicrobial assays demonstrated lysozyme-silver nanoparticles retained the hydrolase function of the enzyme and were effective in inhibiting growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, and Candida albicans. Remarkably, lysozyme-silver nanoparticles demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect against silver-resistant Proteus mirabilis strains and a recombinant E. coli strain containing the multiple antibiotic- and silver-resistant plasmid, pMG101. Results of toxicological studies using human epidermal keratinocytes revealed that lysozyme-silver nanoparticles are nontoxic at concentrations sufficient to inhibit microbial growth. Overall, the ability of lysozyme to assemble silver nanoparticles in a one-step reaction offers a simple and environmentally friendly approach to form stable colloids of nontoxic silver nanoparticles that combine the antimicrobial properties of lysozyme and silver. The results expand the functionality of nanomaterials for biological systems and represent a novel antimicrobial composite for potential aseptics and therapeutic use in the future.
TI  - ECA-immunogenicity of Proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteria of the genus Proteus are opportunistic pathogens and cause mainly urinary tract infections. They also play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (RA). Patients suffering from Yersinia-triggered RA often carry high titers of antibodies specific to enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). The immunogenicity of ECA has not received much attention thus far and studies have focused mainly on the ECA of Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica. In this paper the ECA-immunogenicity of Proteus mirabilis is elucidated using two wild-type strains (S1959 and O28) as well as their rough (R) derivative strains R110/1959, which expresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a full core, and R4/O28, which expresses LPS with only an inner core. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rabbit polyclonal antisera were produced by immunization with boiled suspensions of the four P. mirabilis strains. The antisera were tested for the presence of antibodies specific to ECA by Western blotting using glycerophospholipid- linked ECA (ECA(PG)) of Salmonella montevideo as antigen. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was isolated from the four strains by the hot phenol/water procedure in which ECA(PG) is co-extracted with LPS and by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction that results in the isolation of LPS and/or LPS-linked ECA (ECA(LPS)) free of ECA(PG). The LPS preparations were tested for the presence of ECA by Western blotting using ECA-specific antibodies. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that all four P. mirabilis strains were ECA immunogenic. The rabbit antisera immunized by the four strains all contained ECA-specific antibodies. Analysis of the LPS preparations demonstrated that the P. mirabilis wild-type strains O28 and S1959 and the Ra mutant strain R110/1959 expressed ECA(LPS), suggesting that it induced the anti-ECA antibody responses. Only the presence of ECA(PG) could be demonstrated in the Rc mutant strain R4/O28. CONCLUSIONS: These results therefore suggest that, similar to E. coli, LPS with a full core is also required as the acceptor of ECA for P. mirabilis strains to produce ECA(LPS). Since ECA(PG) is not immunogenic unless combined with some proteins, it is likely that ECA(PG)-protein complexes formed during the intravenous immunization with the Rc mutant strain R4/O28.
TI  - Surveillance of intrahospital infections at the clinic for gynaecology and obstetrics.
AB  - Intrahospital infections (IHI) and antibiotics resistance are the problems which  exist in virtually all hospitals in the world. The main aim of the present research is establishing of epidemiological surveillance over occurrence of IHI at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Clinical Center Tuzla and thus identifies: types of bacteria which cause IHI, types of infection according to anatomical localization and research resistance organisms causing of IHI on antimicrobial drugs. A study was implemented on all patients admitted to Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the period of one year and who subsequently developed infection. Determination of intrahospital infections was done according to criteria defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from the United States. The results of our work have shown that both urinary tract infections and surgical site infections are the most frequent. As IHI causers the most found are gram-negative organisms (73,7%), such as Escherichia coli (29,8%), right after that Klebsiella pneumoniae (24,6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,3%) (p<0,05). Gram-positive organisms as causers of IHI are registered in 26,3% cases. Out of that Streptococcus species are isolated in 10,5% cases, Staphylococcus aureus (8,8%) and coagulasa negative staphylococci (7%) (p>0,05). High percent resistance of bacteria was evident to beta-lactams, aminoglycosids and cephalosporin's of third generation. Gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to vancomycin, while gram-negative organisms manifested the high percent of sensibility to imipenem and cefepime.
TI  - Catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, Centre for paraplegia of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo, were included. The patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: Group A (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; Group B (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; Group C (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. From a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. The overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. Infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. The vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. Providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by Proteus mirabilis (16,3%), Escherichia coli (11,8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), Morganella morgani (5,4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), Providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were Gram-positive with Enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among Acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), Providencia rettgeri (86,7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85,4%), Providencia stuarti (84,3%) and Morganella morgani (81,0%). Lower rates of resistance were found in Group C, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. Eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. Significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. The analysis of Group C showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two Groups of patients. The objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. In addition, possible correlations between UTI and the type of bladder management were examined.
TI  - Growth inhibition of pathogenic bacteria and some yeasts by selected essential oils and survival of L. monocytogenes and C. albicans in apple-carrot juice.
AB  - Food safety is a fundamental concern of both consumers and the food industry. The increasing incidence of foodborne diseases increases the demand of using antimicrobials in foods. Spices and plants are rich in essential oils and show inhibition activity against microorganisms, which are composed of many compounds. In this research, effects of garlic, bay, black pepper, origanum, orange, thyme, tea tree, mint, clove, and cumin essential oils on Listeria monocytogenes AUFE 39237, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Proteus mirabilis AUFE 43566, Bacillus cereus AUFE 81154, Saccharomyces uvarum UUFE 16732, Kloeckera apiculata UUFE 10628, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida oleophila UUPP 94365, and Metschnikowia fructicola UUPP 23067 and effects of thyme oil at a concentration of 0.5% on L. monocytogenes and C. albicans in apple-carrot juice during +4 degrees C storage (first to fifth day) were investigated. Strong antibacterial and antifungal activities of some essential oils were found. Thyme, origanum, clove, and orange essential oils were the most inhibitory against bacteria and yeasts. Cumin, tea tree, and mint oils inhibited the yeasts actively. It is concluded that some essential oils could be used as potential biopreservatives capable of controlling foodborne pathogens and food spoilage yeasts.
TI  - Piscidin 4, a novel member of the piscidin family of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - Piscidins are linear, amphipathic, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with broad, potent, activity spectrum. Piscidins and other members of the piscidin family appear to comprise the most common group of AMPs in teleost fish. All piscidins and related members of the piscidin family described to date are 18-26 amino acids long.We report here the isolation of a novel 5329.25 Da, 44-residue (FFRHLFRGAKAIFRGARQGXRAHKVVSRYRNRDVPETDNNQEEP) antimicrobial peptide from hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops female x M. saxatilis male).We have named this peptide "piscidin 4" since it has considerable (to >65%) N-terminal sequence homology to piscidins 1-3 and this distinctive, 10 to 11-residue, N-terminus is characteristic of piscidins. The native peptide has a modified amino acid at position 20 that, based upon mass spectrometry data, is probably a hydroxylated tryptophan. Synthetic piscidin 4 (with an unmodified tryptophan at position 20) has similar antibacterial activity to that of the native peptide. Piscidin 4 demonstrates potent, broad-spectrum, antibacterial activity against a number of fish and human pathogens, including multi-drug resistant bacteria. Its potent antimicrobial activity suggests that piscidin 4 plays a significant role in the innate defense system of hybrid striped bass.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of crude extract of Aloe barbadensis to clinically isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Aloe barbadensis was tested on clinically isolated  bacterial pathogens i.e. Enterococcus bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing infection in human being. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts were used for the antibacterial effect, which was measured by the appearance of zone of inhibition. Relatively higher MIC concentrations were obtained for gram negative bacteria E. coli and K. pneumoniae, with ethanol extract; however, no inhibitory effect was noted for aqueous extract. Ethanolic extract possesses great inhibitory activity for gram positive bacteria, E. bovis followed by S. aureus. Among gram negative bacteria, highest inhibitory effect was observed with P. aeruginosa, followed by M. morganii, P. mirabilis, and P. vulgaris, which was significant (p < 0.01) than E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity tests of crude extract of A. barbadensis were carried out to validate the use of traditional medicinal herbal and results of this study tend to give credence to the common use of A. barbadensis gel and leaf.
TI  - [Evaluation of the MicroScan NegCombo panel Type 44 for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is important in guiding proper antimicrobial therapy for infected patients. We evaluated the performance of MicroScan NegCombo Type 44 panel (Dade Behring, USA), which was developed to confirm ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae using ceftazidime/clavulanate and cefotaxime/clavulanate. METHODS: From August 30 to September 20, 2007, 206 non-duplicate clinical isolates, including 106 Escherichia coli, 81 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 Klebsiella oxytoca, and 8 Proteus mirabilis were subcultured and tested with Type 32 and Type 44 panels. The results were compared with those of the CLSI phenotypic confirmatory test (CLSI-PCT) and disk approximation test (DAT). Isolates not susceptible to cefotetan or flagged as "Possible ESBL, unable to interpret confirm test (Possible ESBL)" on Type 44 panel were tested with boronic acid disks to confirm AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpC) production. RESULTS: Of the 206 isolates tested, 44 (21.4%) produced ESBL by CLSI-PCT or DAT, including 27 E. coli, 14 K. pneumoniae, 2 K. oxytoca, and 1 P. mirabilis. Thirty-eight isolates flagged as "Confirmed ESBL" on Type 44 panel were all confirmed as ESBL-producers. Of 14 K. pneumoniae flagged as "Possible ESBL", 6 were confirmed as ESBL and AmpC co-producers and 8 as AmpC-producers. CONCLUSIONS: Type 44 panel showed an excellent performance in detecting ESBL-producing E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and P. mirabilis. When flagged as "Confirmed ESBL", no other confirmatory test was necessary to report as ESBL; however, "Possible ESBL" required a differential test for AmpC production.
TI  - New plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrC, found in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Since the discovery of qnrA in 1998, two additional qnr genes, qnrB and qnrS, have been described. These three plasmid-mediated genes contribute to quinolone resistance in gram-negative pathogens worldwide. A clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis was isolated from an outpatient with a urinary tract infection and was susceptible to most antimicrobials but resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Plasmid pHS10, harbored by this strain, was transferred to azide-resistant Escherichia coli J53 by conjugation. A transconjugant with pHS10 had low-level quinolone resistance but was negative by PCR for the known qnr genes, aac(6')-Ib-cr and qepA. The ciprofloxacin MIC for the clinical strain and a J53/pHS10 transconjugant was 0.25 microg/ml, representing an increase of 32-fold relative to that for the recipient, J53. The plasmid was digested with HindIII, and a 4.4-kb DNA fragment containing the new gene was cloned into pUC18 and transformed into E. coli TOP10. Sequencing showed that the responsible 666-bp gene, designated qnrC, encoded a 221-amino-acid protein, QnrC, which shared 64%, 42%, 59%, and 43% amino acid identity with QnrA1, QnrB1, QnrS1, and QnrD, respectively. Upstream of qnrC there existed a new IS3 family insertion sequence, ISPmi1, which encoded a frameshifted transposase. qnrC could not be detected by PCR, however, in 2,020 strains of Enterobacteriaceae. A new quinolone resistance gene, qnrC, was thus characterized from plasmid pHS10 carried by a clinical isolate of P. mirabilis.

TI  - Doripenem activity tested against a global collection of Enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  - The emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates among Enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne AmpC producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. This scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. In this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL- and AmpC-producing strains, were evaluated. A total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria, except for doripenem (product package insert). Overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. ESBL rates were higher among Klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by Escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and Proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). Derepressed AmpC production-mediated resistance rates were highest among Enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. Doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the ESBL phenotype and derepressed AmpC isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem MIC(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). The observed increase in AmpC- and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on carbapenem empiric therapy. Doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary Enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of fruit and leaf crude extracts of Momordica charantia: a Tanzania medicinal plant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Momordica charantia extracts on reference strains and microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. METHOD: Petroleum ether and methanolic crude extracts of fruits and leaves of the plant were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the disk diffusion method on four reference microorganisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus; and four clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi and Cryptococcus neoformans. RESULT: Antimicrobial activity was observed against all the tested microorganisms with exception to P. mirabilis and C. neoformans. Methanolic crude extracts exhibited relatively broader antimicrobial spectrum of activity than petroleum ether extracts with the as lower concentration as 0.075mg/microl. Methanolic fruit crude extract displayed the broadest antimicrobial spectrum by inhibiting majority (75%) of the tested microorganisms. Neither was there synergistic nor addition effect upon mixing leaf and fruit extracts of equal concentrations derived from the same solvent. CONCLUSION: Extracts of M.charantia demonstrated antimicrobial activity on tested microorganisms except on Proteus mirabilis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Fruit extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity than leaf extract. Further studies are recommended that will involve various parts of the plant, select different fractions of extracts and purify the active antimicrobial components.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Comparison of PCR-based molecular markers for the characterization of Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is one of the most important pathogens associated with complicated urinary tract infections (acute pyelonephritis, bladder infections, kidney stones) and bacteremia, affecting patients with anatomical abnormalities, immunodeficiency, and long-term urinary catheterization. For epidemiological purposes, various molecular typing methods, such as pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or ribotyping, have been developed for this pathogen. However, these methods are labor intensive and time-consuming. We evaluated the discriminatory power of several PCR-based fingerprinting methods (RAPD, ISSR, ERIC-PCR, BOX-PCR and rep-PCR) for P. mirabilis clinical isolates. Typing patterns and clustering analysis indicated that RAPD, BOX-PCR and ERIC-PCR differentiated P. mirabilis strains from Escherichia coli, Hafnia alvei, and Morganella morganii. With the exception of rep-PCR, the methods gave medium to high discriminatory efficiency in P. mirabilis. In general, the results obtained with RAPD, BOX-PCR and ERIC-PCR were in good agreement. We concluded that a combination of ERIC-PCR and BOX-PCR results is a rapid and reliable alternative for discrimination among P. mirabilis clinical isolates, contributing to epidemiological studies.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance analysis of bacteria in different wound infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug resistance of bacteria in different wound infections and provide evidence for wound infection control in subtropical regions. METHODS: This study involved 265 patients from 4 different departments of our hospital who experienced wound infections between July, 2007 and July, 2008. The bacterial strain distribution in the wounds and drug resistance of the bacteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumanii (39% of the total strain identified) was the most frequent bacterial strain causing infection of the burn wounds, followed by Proteus mirabilis (20%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). E. coli infection was prevalent in the departments of general surgery (37%) and urinary surgery (64%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pneumonia infections were detected at the rate of 30% and 43% in the urinary surgery department, respectively. Different bacterial strains were found at similar rates around 10% in the wounds of patients undergoing traumatic surgery. CONCLUSION: Despite that the commonly seen pathogenic bacteria in burn patients including Staphylococcus aureus have been effectively controlled by early application of antibiotics, the opportunistic pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Proteus mirabilis often survive these antibiotics, and some strains evolve to be drug-resistant and even multi-drug-resistant. E. coli infection is prevalent in general surgery and urinary surgery departments, where Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can also be found frequently. All kinds of bacteria infection are present in trauma surgery department, each found at the rate around 10%.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
TI  - Significance of the cyclic structure and of arginine residues for the antibacterial activity of arenicin-1 and its interaction with phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide model membranes.
AB  - Arenicin-1 (Ar-1) is a beta-sheeted antimicrobial peptide from the marine lugworm Arenicola marina. To elucidate the significance of its unique 18-residue cyclic structure and of six cationic arginines for its biological activity and its interaction with biomembranes, we synthesized one linear peptide in which the two cysteines were exchanged for serines (C/S-Ar-1) and a cyclic peptide in which all arginines were replaced by lysines (R/K-Ar-1). We addressed antibacterial and hemolytic activities, the impact of the peptides on bacterial morphology, and their binding to, intercalation into, and permeabilization of model membranes composed of phospholipids or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In accordance with high salt concentration in sea water, the antibacterial activity of Ar-1 was almost insensitive to high NaCl concentrations. In contrast, the linear derivative lost activity under these conditions against polymyxin B-resistant Proteus mirabilis. Ar-1 intercalated into phospholipid and LPS membranes and formed heterogeneous and short-lived lesions. However, when the peptide was present in both membrane leaflets, it formed defined pores. This characteristic was not observed for the linear derivative C/S-Ar-1. Apparently, the disulfide bond provides conforma-tional stability, which has an impact on salt tolerance, prevents fast degradation by trypsin, and is a prerequisite for the formation of structurally defined pores.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - SUMMARY: AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).
TI  - Discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - A number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-Trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. Eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two Gram-positive strains of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with LC(50) of 5.8 muM and 5.6 muM respectively. However, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-negative strains, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-Gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens responsible for community-acquired urinary tract infections in an Italian community.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the pattern of the antimicrobial resistance among the leading uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs in an area of the region of Apulia, Southern Italy. Twenty-one thousand and two hundred outpatients, 6,893 males and 14,307 females, were enrolled. Urinary isolates were identified by conventional methods and the susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials determined. Recognized uropathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were isolated from 3175 positive samples, E. coli accounting for 68.04% of positive cultures. Most overall resistance was to ampicillin, while the resistance rate to cephalothin was higher than that of third generation cephalosporins. Although to a different degree, all the bacteria had an overall good susceptibility rate to quinolones as well as to fosfomycin but increased resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Our results confirm that E. coli is the leading uropathogen and provide information about the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the main pathogens causing community-acquired UTIs. These findings should be taken into account to help maintain the safety and efficacy of treatment for community-acquired UTIs.
TI  - Laboratory detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase by an automated system.
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative  predictive value (NPV) of Vitek2 in detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes when compared to a manual confirmatory test as gold standard. A sample of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Proteus mirabilis isolates were collected by 5 laboratories in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy). Vitek2 appears to be an accurate tool to detect ESBL phenotypes of E. coli isolates; some concern remains about its performance with the other bacterial species, especially P. mirabilis.
TI  - Large scale multiplex PCR improves pathogen detection by DNA microarrays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium density DNA microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. However, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen DNA. RESULTS: To increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex PCR (LSplex PCR) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. This protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. The LSplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. Application of LSplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen DNA by microarray hybridization by using LSplex PCR.
TI  - Comparison of solid-phase cytometry and the plate count method for the evaluation of the survival of bacteria in pharmaceutical oils.
AB  - AIM: To compare the survival of four bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in pharmaceutical oils, including jojoba oil/tea tree oil, carbol oil, jojoba oil and sesame oil. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oils were spiked with the test bacteria in a concentration of 10(4) CFU ml(-1). Bacteria were extracted from oils with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. Aliquots of the pooled water layers were analysed by solid-phase cytometry and plate counting. Plate counts dropped to zero for all test strains exposed for 24 h to three of the four oils. In contrast, significant numbers of viable cells were still detected by SPC, except in the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture and partly in sesame oil. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of bacteria for 24 h to the two oils containing an antimicrobial led to a loss of their culturability but not necessarily of their viability. The antibacterial activity of the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture supersedes that of carbol oil. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These in vitro data suggest that the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture more than carbol oil inhibits bacterial proliferation when used for intermittent self-catherization.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - [Susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae rods to selected tetracyclines].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluated the susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae rods to tigecycline, tetracycline and doxycycline. We analysed 121 strains belonged to species as follows: Escherichia coli (40 strains), Proteus mirabilis (22), Enterobacter cloacae (19), Klebsiellapneumoniae (18), Morganella morgannii (13), Serratia marcescens (4), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) i Proteus vulgaris (2). All strains of E. coli, K. oxytoca, S. marcescens and P. vulgaris were susceptible to tigecycline. Twenty five of analysed strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Among of ESBL-positive strains 22 (88.0%) were susceptible to tigecycline and 13 (52.0%) to tetracycline and doxycycline.
TI  - Oxygen-limiting conditions enrich for fimbriate cells of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - MR/P fimbriae of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis undergo invertible element-mediated phase variation whereby an individual bacterium switches between expressing fimbriae (phase ON) and not expressing fimbriae (phase OFF). Under different conditions, the percentage of fimbriate bacteria within a population varies and could be dictated by either selection (growth advantage of one phase) or signaling (preferentially converting one phase to the other in response to external signals). Expression of MR/P fimbriae increases in a cell-density dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. However, rather than the increased cell density itself, this increase in fimbrial expression is due to an enrichment of fimbriate bacteria under oxygen limitation resulting from increased cell density. Our data also indicate that the persistence of MR/P fimbriate bacteria under oxygen-limiting conditions is a result of both selection (of MR/P fimbrial phase variants) and signaling (via modulation of expression of the MrpI recombinase). Furthermore, the mrpJ transcriptional regulator encoded within the mrp operon contributes to phase switching. Type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, which are likewise subject to phase variation via an invertible element, also increase in expression during reduced oxygenation. These findings provide evidence to support a mechanism for persistence of fimbriate bacteria under oxygen limitation, which is relevant to disease progression within the oxygen-restricted urinary tract.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of pomegranate rind extracts: enhancement by addition of metal salts and vitamin C.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Punica granatum L. or pomegranates, have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against a range of Gram positive and negative bacteria. Pomegranate formulations containing ferrous salts have enhanced although short-term, antibacteriophage activities which are rapidly diminished owing to instability of the ferrous combination. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activities of combinations of pomegranate rind extracts (PRE) with a range of metals salts with the added stabiliser vitamin C. METHODS: PRE solutions, prepared by blending rind sections with distilled water prior to sterilisation by autoclaving or filtration, were screened with a disc diffusion assay using penicillin G as a control. Suspension assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of PRE alone and in combination with salts of the following metals; Fe (II), Cu (II), Mn (II) or Zn (II), and vitamin C, against a panel of microbes following exposure for 30 mins. The test organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The screening assay demonstrated that PRE exhibited activity against the Gram positive organisms at 24 h with no observable effect on any of the Gram negative bacteria. However, after 12 h, zones of inhibition were only observed for Ps. aeruginosa. In contrast, using the suspension assay, addition of Cu (II) salts to PRE solutions extended the activities resulting in no detectable growth being observed for the PRE/Cu (II) combination against E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Minimal antimicrobial activity was observed following incubation with Fe (II), Mn (II) or Zn (II) salts alone or in combination with PRE against any of the organisms in the test panel. The addition of vitamin C markedly enhanced the activities of both PRE/Fe (II) and PRE/Cu (II) combinations against S. aureus. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of PRE/metal salt combinations in the presence of the stabilising agent vitamin C, to which all isolates were sensitive with the exception of B. subtilis. This study has validated the exploration of PRE along with additives such as metal salts and vitamin C as novel antimicrobial combinations.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance in Taiwan of the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigecycline In-vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST), initiated in 2006, is a nationwide surveillance programme designed to monitor longitudinally the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered resistant bacteria. This study compared the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of resistant Gram-negative bacteria determined by the broth microdilution and Etest methods. A total of 622 isolates were collected from patients treated at 20 teaching hospitals. Tigecycline had excellent in-vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (N = 275) with MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL and a 99.6% susceptibility rate, and also against ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 324) with MIC(90) 2 microg/mL and a 98.5% susceptibility rate. For ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis (N = 15) the MIC(90) was 4 microg/mL with a 73.3% susceptibility rate. For ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca (N = 8) the MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.5 and 1 microg/mL, respectively, with a 100% susceptibility rate. Limited agreement (<80%) was found between the broth microdilution and the Etest methods when determining the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against ESBL- producing K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca.
TI  - Changing trend in antimicrobial resistance of pediatric uropathogens in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing concern regarding antimicrobial resistance worldwide, particularly of Escherichia coli, and the first choice of an antimicrobial agent for empiric treatment of pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) is not well established. METHODS: The medical records from January 1991 to December 2005 for all children under 18 years of age admitted to Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei for their first UTI were reviewed. Two study periods, early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005), were chosen during the 15 year period for evaluating the trend of antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: Of the 368 isolates, E. coli was the most common pathogen (81.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.0%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). Of the 368 isolates, 77.4% were resistant to ampicillin, 44.6% to co-trimoxazole, 27.2% to cephalothin, 15.0% to gentamicin, and 8.4% to nitrofurantoin. In the early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005) study periods, 199 isolates (54.1%) and 169 isolates (45.9%), respectively, were compared. The resistance to antimicrobial agents for overall pathogens in the early and late study periods, respectively, was as follows: 68.8% and 88.0% to ampicillin, 48.9% and 46.6% to co-trimoxazole, 26.8% and 28.9% to cephalothin, 16.2% and 19.8% to gentamicin, and 8.7% and 9.0% to nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSION: Among commonly used antimicrobial agents for the treatment of pediatric UTI, there is a trend towards increasing resistance to ampicillin and a persistently low resistance rate to gentamicin, cephalosporin, and nitrofurantoin. Parenteral first-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, and oral nitrofurantoin should be considered for first-line agents, given the resistance patterns of this study.
TI  - [Fluoroquinolones and Gram-negative bacteria: antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of resistance].
AB  - Fluoroquinolones acts by interacting with type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and  topoisomerases IV). Related to this mechanism of action, bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms consisting in some target mutations (GyrA/GyrB for DNA gyrase and ParC/ParE for topoisomerase IV) or in a reduced access to the target itself, by either decreased permeability or augmented expression of efflux pumps, such as AcrAB and MexAB. Along with these classical mechanisms of chromosomal resistance, the presence of fluoroquinolones resistant proteins (Qnr) has been recently evidenced, codified by transmissible genes by means of plasmids, especially in Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas Proteus mirabilis and non fermenter Gram-negative, like Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are not involved in such a kind of resistance. Qnr proteins determine a slight increase in MIC values, which often remains below the susceptibility breakpoint. More relevant is their impact on MPC values. Additionally, new specific resistance mechanisms have been described. AAC(6')-Ib-cr represents the first enzyme able to inactivate, by acetylation, antimicrobials of two different classes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. However, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but not levofloxacin, are susceptible to this enzyme action. Finally, the presence of another resistance mechanism has been reported, an efflux-pump plasmid-mediated, codified by the QepA gene, which acts by a selective mechanism. Only hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not all the other ones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc, are affected by this mechanism. In the light of these new information, it is clear that, in terms of bacterial resistance, it is not any more possible to assimilate one fluoroquinolones to another, since different molecules can be diversely active, due to the specific resistance mechanism.
TI  - Emphysematous cystitis.
AB  
TI  - Characterization and sequence analysis of extended-spectrum-{beta}-lactamase-encoding genes from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected during tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials.
AB  - In concert with the development of novel beta-lactams and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, bacterially encoded beta-lactamases have evolved to accommodate the new agents. This study was designed to identify, at the sequence level, the genes responsible for the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected during the global tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials. PCR assays were developed to identify and clone the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), and bla(CTX) genes from clinical strains. Isolates were also screened for AmpC genes of the bla(CMY), bla(ACT), bla(FOX), and bla(DHA) families as well as the bla(KPC) genes encoding class A carbapenemases. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates with ceftazidime MICs of > or =2 microg/ml were designated possible ESBL-producing pathogens and were then subjected to a confirmatory test for ESBLs by use of Etest. Of 272 unique patient isolates, 239 were confirmed by PCR and sequencing to carry the genes for at least one ESBL, with 44% of the positive isolates harboring the genes for multiple ESBLs. In agreement with current trends for ESBL distribution, bla(CTX-M)-type beta-lactamase genes were found in 83% and 71% of the ESBL-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively, whereas bla(SHV) genes were found in 41% and 28% of the ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were tigecycline susceptible (MIC(90) = 2 microg/ml), warranting further studies to define the therapeutic utility of tigecycline against strains producing ESBLs in a clinical setting.
TI  - Utility of reflexive semen cultures for detecting bacterial infections in patients with infertility and leukocytospermia.
AB  - This study evaluated the benefit of reflexive semen cultures in peroxidase-positive samples drawn from 17,142 consecutive samples analyzed, in which 4.7% (807/17,142) had leukocytospermia and 12.7% of those (103/807) grew significant bacterial colonies on culture. Considering the potential ramifications of the use of samples with bacteriospermia, we conclude that reflexive culture results are cost-effective and prudent.
TI  - A rapid method for determining Mycobacterium tuberculosis based on a bulk acoustic wave impedance biosensor.
AB  - The bulk acoustic wave impedance biosensor was set up and used to monitor the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB). This sensor is rapid, simple, sensitive (lower limit is 2 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) and cheap (easy to generalize). The typical response curve was different from other bacteria's, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis. The frequency detection time was used to quantitatively determine M.TB. It was proportional to logarithm of the initial concentration of M.TB in the range of 2 x 10(3)-3 x 10(7) cells ml(-1). The set up sensor was applied to the direct diagnosis of M.TB samples. The interference of other bacteria was eliminated by pretreatment. Our results confirmed that the use of the set up biosensor was reliable, sensitive. It gives out the potential use for determining M.TB.
TI  - Evaluation of screening methods to detect plasmid-mediated AmpC in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - There are currently no standardized phenotypic methods for the screening and detection of AmpC enzymes. This study aimed to evaluate different methods to detect AmpC enzymes in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp., comparing the results from two disk-based methods and an agar dilution method. AmpC activity was determined for 255 clinical isolates by use of a three-dimensional enzyme assay combined with a multiplex PCR assay for plasmid-borne ampC genes. These results were compared against a disk-based inhibitor assay using various combinations of cefpodoxime and cefoxitin as antibiotic substrates and boronic acid or cloxacillin as an AmpC inhibitor. The presence of enzyme induction by disk approximation was evaluated using imipenem, cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate as inducing agents against ceftazidime. Finally, an agar dilution assay was performed, using cefoxitin with and without added cloxacillin. AmpC activity was present in 49.8% of test isolates, 93.7% of which were positive for plasmid-borne ampC genes. CIT-like enzymes were predominant in E. coli, and DHA-like enzymes were predominant in Klebsiella spp. The disk-based inhibitor tests performed better than the agar dilution assay, while detection of AmpC by disk induction had a poor sensitivity. The cefoxitin-cloxacillin disk combination provided the best overall performance, with a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. This study confirmed the accuracy of disk-based inhibitor screening for AmpC enzymes, which proved reliable at detecting CIT- and DHA-like plasmid-borne ampC genes. The methods are simple enough for introduction into clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - [Recent evolution and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria in the CHU of Nice (2005-2007)].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: ESBL producing enterobacteria (E-ESBL+) are always a public health concern, mainly due to increase of CTX-M beta-lactamase. So, 542 new strains were isolated in the CHU de Nice during the 2005-2007 period. The aim of this work was to characterize the ESBL and to type isolates suspected to be implicated in outbreaks. METHODS: Every first E-ESBL+ was studied, the antibiotype was defined by the agar diffusion technique. Type of ESBL was determined by PCR, followed by sequencing for CTX-M and SHV enzymes. Typing was performed when several strains of one species had same antibiotype and beta-lactamase. RESULTS: CTX-M type ESBL are predominant (45% of all E-ESBL+), mainly in Escherichia coli (34.5%). The TEM24 ESBL was the second predominant type (34.5%), mainly in Enterobacter aerogenes (18.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.4%). SHV5/12 ESBL was found mainly in Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%). Several epidemic situations were identified, with CTX-M15 in Escherichia coli (2005/2006: 27 patients), SHV5/12 in Enterobacter cloacae (2006: 10 patients) and TEM in Proteus mirabilis (2007: nine patients). Enterobacter aerogenes is still endemic (101 patients) while an epidemic clone of TEM24 producing K. pneumoniae persists especially in an intensive care unit (26 patients during the three years). CONCLUSION: Caracterization of E-ESBL+ is essential to better understand their mode of dissemination, monitor the emergence of new enzymes and adapt the efforts against BMR cross transmission.
TI  - Uropathogens and host characteristics.
AB  - Uropathogens other than Escherichia coli occur with greater frequency in patients with risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI). However, little is known about associations between uropathogen species and host characteristics. Three hundred nineteen urine specimens containing a balanced distribution of uropathogen species were selected from inpatients and outpatients at a university hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. Information on host characteristics was retrospectively collected by chart review. Differences in the frequencies of host characteristics in UTI groups, as defined by the causative uropathogen, were compared by chi-square/Fisher analysis. Multivariate classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify host characteristic subsets that distinguish among uropathogen groups. In this exploratory study, several uropathogen species were found to be strongly linked to host characteristics relevant to UTI. Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa UTIs were more likely to have undergone urinary tract procedures (43% versus 15% overall), to have a neurogenic bladder (29% versus 12% overall), to have received recent antibiotic therapy (52% versus 24% overall), and to be male (76% versus 28% overall). Patients with Proteus mirabilis UTIs were more likely to have a foreign body in the lower urinary tract (48% versus 30% overall). The classification tree identified males over the age of 27 years who had undergone a prior urinary tract procedure as belonging to a host characteristic profile associated with P. aeruginosa UTI: 38% of patients with P. aeruginosa UTIs fit this profile. These data may be useful for planning future targeted prophylaxis studies.
TI  - Non-susceptibility trends among Enterobacteriaceae from bacteraemias in the UK and Ireland, 2001-06.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacteriaceae are common agents of bacteraemia, with Escherichia coli accounting for 20% of the cases. Reflecting this importance, members of the family constitute 4 of the 12 collection groups in the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) Bacteraemia Surveillance Programme. METHODS: MICs from the BSAC surveillance programme were reviewed, along with bacteraemia reports received by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) via its CoSurv/LabBase system. Isolates with unusual resistances were subjected to molecular analysis. RESULTS: The BSAC and HPA systems both revealed dramatically increasing resistance to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin among E. coli and Klebsiella spp., with cephalosporin resistance largely contingent on the spread of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs); fluoroquinolone resistance also increased among Proteus mirabilis and ESBL-negative E. coli. Carbapenem resistance remained extremely rare, but two Enterobacter spp., from the same patient in different years, had KPC carbapenemases, while a few isolates had carbapenem resistance contingent upon combinations of beta-lactamase and impermeability, and ertapenem MICs for AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter spp. rose over time. Three new agents-ceftobiprole, doripenem and tigecycline-were tested. Ceftobiprole was broadly active, except against ESBL producers and Klebsiella oxytoca hyperproducing K1 enzyme, and was variable against AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter spp. and against Proteus vulgaris. Doripenem was more potent than imipenem. Tigecycline was almost universally active against E. coli, but low-level non-susceptibility (MIC 2 mg/L) was frequent among Klebsiella spp. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli and Klebsiella spp. showed dramatic shifts, with sharply rising non-susceptibility to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The rise in cephalosporin resistance reflected dissemination of CTX-M ESBLs. Carbapenems remain broadly active and new agents offer potential.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fruits of Iranian Torilis leptophylla against some  clinical pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract of Torilis leptophylla was tested on eleven bacteria (Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Brucella melitensis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Bordetella bronshiseptica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Tested extract was effective against all bacteria but not B. subtilis. Consequently, the ethanolic extract had antibacterial activity on some pathogens thus confirming their use in folk medicine.
TI  - A prospective study of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much controversy exists as to whether cephalosporin treatment is appropriate for infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms because no randomized controlled studies have been performed. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors performed a prospective study in female patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, or P. mirabilis in four hospitals in Thailand from 2004 to 2006. The clinical and microbiological outcomes were evaluated at 72 hours after empirical ceftriaxone treatment. RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients with the mean age of 65.29 years participated in this study. There were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory data between the ESBL-producing and ESBL-nonproducing groups except the higher rates of previous antibiotic use and urinary tract infection; and the lower frequency of costovertebral angle tenderness in the ESBL-producing group. Both clinical (65% and 93%) and microbiological (67.5% and 100%) responses at 72 hours after ceftriaxone treatment were poorer in the ESBL-producing group than in the ESBL-nonproducing group (p < 0.0002). CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate the outcomes of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The present study confirms that acute pyelonephritis in the female patients caused by ESBL-producing strains could not be treated with ceftriaxone.
TI  - [Lower urinary tract infections: bacterial epidemiology and recommendations].
AB  - Lower urinary tract infection remains frequent particularly in women, despite improvement in therapeutic means. It seems likely to revisit bacterial epidemiology and therapeutic available strategies. To analyze elements in presence i.e. infecting bacteria and antibiotics still active or identification of acquired resistance mechanisms should permit to establish the evolution during the last 10 years. The study shows that bacterial epidemiology in urinary tract infection has not changed significantly, despite antibiotic selective pressure expected from overused antibiotics. However few enterobacteriaceae more resistant than Escherichia coli have emerged, but the latter remains predominant. Development of resistance has concerned Negram, amoxicillin and Augmentin, but several active molecules such as ciprofloxacin, Monuril remain available. Duration of treatments are still discussed but there is a tend toward short durations and even mono-doses. The control of lower urinary tract infections remains relatively easy provided that a good therapeutic choice is based on well documented bacteriologic data (infecting species susceptible to the available antibiotics).
TI  - Prevalence and mechanisms of broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: a children's hospital experience.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the trends and patterns of resistance in beta-lactamase-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in a children's hospital over a 9-year period (1999 to 2007). Clinically significant isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae were screened for patterns of broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams. The strains likely to be resistant were subsequently confirmed by an inhibitor-based disc test. The plasmid-mediated resistance determinants in these isolates were identified by PCR and by in vitro transformation, which successfully reproduced the AmpC phenotype unrestricted by the species of the host organisms. Among 8,048 Enterobacteriaceae isolates belonging to the four chromosomal ampC-negative or -nonfunctional genera, 86 (1.07%) isolates (56 Escherichia coli isolates, 22 Klebsiella species isolates, 1 Proteus mirabilis isolate, and 7 Salmonella species isolates) exhibited broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance patterns. These organisms collectively produced three classes of beta-lactamases, including class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (n = 47), class C or AmpC beta-lactamases (n = 36, including 4 isolates that produced both class A and class C enzymes), and class A or B carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases (n = 3). The proportion increased from 0.46% during the first 3 years to 1.84% during the last 3 years (relative risk [RR], 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.28 to 7.42; P < 0.001). The increase was mainly due to the emergence of a plasmid-mediated bla(CMY-2) beta-lactamase, the incidence of which increased from 0.11% during the first 3 years to 0.96% during the last 3 years (RR, 9.11; 95% CI, 2.76 to 30.1; P = 0.001). Class A-type resistance increased slightly during the study period, from 0.35% during the first 3 years to 0.85% during the last 3 years (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.15 to 5.07; P = 0.02). A Proteus mirabilis strain was documented to possess a novel bla(DHA) determinant. Of special concern, three carbapenemase-producing isolates were identified between 2003 and 2006. The infections caused by resistant isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae mainly affected hospitalized patients with underlying conditions; however, 19 (22%) episodes were of community onset in otherwise well children. The rate of resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams among isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae is increasing in children in both hospital- and community-acquired settings, and the resistance is driven largely by plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. These data have important implications for empirical antimicrobial strategies targeting serious pediatric infections. Further study of this problem is warranted.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens among outpatients, 2000-2004].
AB  - A retrospective study based on the electronic database of a university hospital was carried out to investigate the prevalence of etiological agents and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, among adult outpatients (> 18 years old) with urinary tract infections. Nine hundred and fifty-seven positive urine cultures were identified between January 2000 and December 2004. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella sp were the three principal bacterial etiological agents. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole presented the highest prevalence of bacterial resistance (46.9%), followed by cefalotin (46.7%), nalidixic acid (27.6%) and nitrofurantoin (22.3%). Over the study period, nalidixic acid presented annual increases of 5.9% in the rate of bacterial resistance (p = 0.02). Ciprofloxacin also showed an increasing trend, of 3.3% per year (p = 0.07). This study demonstrated that the antibiotics that are widely recommended for empirical treatment of urinary tract infection in adults presented high rates of bacterial resistance among the population studied.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - The crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust Foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization. Models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. The catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. The effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the pH of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. The extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. In models inoculated with communities containing Proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary pH that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. The biocide had no effect on populations of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. In models inoculated with a mixed community containing Providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. Although K. pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of Providencia rettgeri. The results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units in Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwanese intensive care units (ICUs), a national surveillance of antibiotic resistance among important Enterobacteriaceae was conducted from September 2005 through November 2005 at the ICUs of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 574 Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from various clinical samples of our ICU patients were submitted for in vitro test. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these isolates to 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. The prevalences of Enterobacteriaceae isolates with phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were 26% in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 16% in Serratia marcescens, 14% in Escherichia coli, and 13% in Proteus mirabilis, in which a significantly rising prevalence of ESBL production among K. pneumoniae was noted (p = 0.002) when compared with a previous Taiwanese survey in 2000. Heterogeneous resistance to various fluoroquinolones was found among our Enterobacteriaceae isolates, except for Enterobacter cloacae. Emergence of ertapenem-resistant isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and S. marcescens was noted. Gradually increasing rates of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were noted in Taiwanese ICUs. Periodic surveillance of the evolutionary trend of antimicrobial resistance among ICU isolates is crucial for starting appropriately empirical antimicrobial therapy in the future.
TI  - PapX, a P fimbrial operon-encoded inhibitor of motility in uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Motility and adherence are two integral aspects of bacterial pathogenesis. Adherence, often mediated by fimbriae, permits bacteria to attach to host cells and establish infection, whereas flagellum-driven motility allows bacteria to disseminate to sites more advantageous for colonization. Both fimbriae and flagella have been proven important for virulence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Reciprocal regulation is one mechanism by which bacteria may reconcile the contradictory actions of adherence and motility. PapX, a P fimbrial gene product of UPEC strain CFT073, is a functional homolog of MrpJ of Proteus mirabilis; ectopic expression of papX in P. mirabilis reduces motility. To define the connection between P fimbria expression and motility in UPEC, the role of papX in the regulation of motility of strain CFT073 was examined. Overexpression of papX decreased motility of CFT073, which correlated with both a significant reduction in flagellin protein synthesized and flagella assembled on the cell surface. Conversely, an increase in motility and flagellin production was seen in an isogenic papX deletion mutant of CFT073. Microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that repression of motility of CFT073 by PapX appears to occur at the transcriptional level; expression of many motility-associated genes, including flhDC, the master regulator of motility, is decreased when papX is overexpressed. Transcription of motility genes is increased in the papX mutant compared to wild type. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift analysis revealed that PapX binds to the flhD promoter. We conclude that synthesis of P fimbriae regulates flagellum synthesis to repress motility via PapX.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of fish mucus from Channa punctatus and Cirrhinus mrigala.
AB  - Extracts and preparations made from the animal origin were used extensively in folk and modern medicine for treating many human diseases. In the present study efforts have been made to find the antimicrobial effect of the mucus of two bottom dwelling fresh water fishes namely, Channa punctatus and Cirrhinus mrigala. Fish mucus were tested against ten pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholera. The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition in mm. The mucus collected from Cirrhinus mrigala shows a strong inhibiting activity than the mucus of Channa punctatus.
TI  - Antibacterial iridoid glucosides from Eremostachys laciniata.
AB  - Eremostachys laciniata (L) Bunge (family: Lamiaceae alt. Labiatae; subfamily: Lamioideae) is one of the 15 endemic Iranian herbs of the genus Eremostachys. A decoction of the roots and flowers of E. laciniata has traditionally been taken orally for the treatment of allergies, headache and liver diseases. Three antibacterial iridoid glucosides, phloyoside I (1), phlomiol (2) and pulchelloside I (3) have been isolated from the rhizomes of this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unequivocally by a series of 1D and 2D NMR analyses. The antibacterial activity and brine shrimp toxicity of these compounds were assessed using the resazurin microtitre assay and the brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. All three iridoid glycosides 1-3 exhibited from low to moderate levels (MIC = 0.05-0.50 mg/mL) of antibacterial activity. Of these compounds, compound 3 was the most active, and displayed antibacterial activity against 9 of 12 different strains tested. The most noteworthy activity of 3 was against Bacillus cereus, penicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 0.05 mg/mL.
TI  - DNA fragmentation in microorganisms assessed in situ.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA fragmentation may be a direct or indirect outcome of cell death.  Unlike DNA fragmentation in higher eukaryotic cells, DNA fragmentation in microorganisms is rarely studied. We report an adaptation of a diffusion-based assay, developed as a kit, which allows for simple and rapid discrimination of bacteria with fragmented DNA. Intact cells were embedded in an agarose microgel on a slide, incubated in a lysis buffer to partially remove the cell walls, membranes, and proteins, and then stained with a DNA fluorochrome, SYBR Gold. Identifying cells with fragmented DNA uses peripheral diffusion of DNA fragments. Cells without DNA fragmentation show only limited spreading of DNA fiber loops. These results have been seen in several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as in yeasts. Detection of DNA fragmentation was confirmed by fluoroquinolone treatment and by DNA breakage detection-fluorescence in situ hybridization. Proteus mirabilis with spontaneously fragmented DNA during exponential and stationary growth or Escherichia coli with DNA damaged after exposure to hydrogen peroxide or antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or ampicillin, was clearly detected. Similarly, fragmented DNA was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae after amphotericin B treatment. Our assay may be useful for the simple and rapid evaluation of DNA damage and repair as well as cell death, either spontaneous or induced by exogenous stimuli, including antimicrobial agents or environmental conditions.
TI  - Detection of KPC-2 in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis and first reported  description of carbapenemase resistance caused by a KPC beta-lactamase in P. mirabilis.
AB  - An isolate of Proteus mirabilis recovered from blood cultures of a diabetic patient was shown to be resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem by disk diffusion susceptibility testing. Amplification of whole-cell and/or plasmid DNA recovered from the isolate with primers specific for the bla(KPC) carbapenemase gene produced an amplicon of the expected size which was confirmed to be bla(KPC-2) by sequence analysis. Transformation of a susceptible Escherichia coli host with plasmid preparations from the isolate generated a transformant for which the MICs of all of the carbapenems tested were increased three- to fourfold. We believe this to be the first report of carbapenem resistance in P. mirabilis caused by the acquisition of bla(KPC).
TI  - Serotyping of clinical isolates belonging to Proteus mirabilis serogroup O36 and  structural elucidation of the O36-antigen polysaccharide.
AB  - The O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of Proteus mirabilis O36 was found to have a pentasaccharide repeating unit of the following structure: -->2)-beta-D-Ribf-(1-->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc6Ac-(1-->4)-beta-D-G alp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->. The structure is unique among Proteus OPS, which is in agreement with the classification of this strain into a separate Proteus O-serogroup. Remarkably, the P. mirabilis O36-polysaccharide has the same structure as the OPS of Escherichia coli O153, except that the latter is devoid of O-acetyl groups. The cross-reaction of anti-O36 antibodies with the O-part of E. coli O153 lipopolysaccharide is observed. In the present study, two steps of serotyping Proteus strains are proposed: screening of dry mass with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot with the crude lipopolysaccharides. This method allowed serotyping of 99 P. mirabilis strains infecting the human urinary tract. Three strains were classified into serogroup O36. The migration pattern of these lipopolysaccharides fraction with long O-specific PSs was similar to the standard laboratory P. mirabilis O36 (Prk 62/57) lipopolysaccharide. The relatively low number of clinical strains belonging to serogroup O36 did not correspond to the presence of anti-P. mirabilis O36 antibodies in the blood donors' sera. Twenty-five percent of tested sera contained a statistically significant elevated level of antibodies reacting with thermostable surface antigens of P. mirabilis O36. The presence and amount of antibodies correlated with Thr399Ile TLR4 polymorphism types (P=0.044).
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in the elderly: high prevalence and high turnover of strains.
AB  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) was followed in repeated prevalence surveys in a cohort of non-institutionalized residents (n=330), aged>or=80 y. Urine samples were collected at baseline, and at 6, and at 18 months. Phenotyping (PhenePlate) was performed on isolates of Escherichia coli to evaluate strain relatedness. ASB occurred in 19.0, 19.4, and 19.9% in women, and in 9.4, 9.6 and 7.9% in men, at baseline and at the 6- and 18-months follow-up, respectively, and ASB was found at least once in 37% of women and in 20% of men. Of those with ASB at baseline, 60% also had ASB in the 2 subsequent surveys. Among those with persisting E. coli bacteriuria, 76% and 40%, respectively, carried the same strain at the 6- and 18-months follow-ups. In women, we found that the risk of developing a symptomatic urinary tract infection within 24 months was higher among those with ASB at baseline than in those without bacteriuria (p=0.019). ASB is common and often persistent, but we found a high turnover of strains, indicating a high rate of recolonization.
TI  - Surface acoustic wave biosensor as a tool to study the interaction of antimicrobial peptides with phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide model membranes.
AB  - Surface acoustic wave biosensors are a powerful tool for the study of biomolecular interactions. The modulation of a surface-confined acoustic wave is utilized here for the analysis of surface binding. Phase and amplitude of the wave correspond roughly to mass loading and viscoelastic properties of the surface, respectively. We established a procedure to reconstitute phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide bilayers on the surface of a modified gold sensor chip to study the mode of action of membrane-active peptides. The procedure included the formation of a self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanol, covalent coupling of carboxymethyl-dextran, and subsequent coating with a poly- l-lysine layer. The lipid coverage of the surface is highly reproducible and homogeneous as demonstrated in atomic force micrographs. Ethanol/triton treatment removed the lipids completely, which provided the basis for continuous sequences of independent experiments. The setup was applied to investigate the binding of human cathelicidin-derived peptide LL32, as an example for antimicrobial peptides, to immobilized phosphatidylserine membranes. The peptide-membrane interaction results in a positive phase shift and an increase in amplitude, indicating a mass increase along with a loss in viscosity. This suggests that the bilayer becomes more rigid upon interaction with LL32.
TI  - [Etiology of acute and chronic pyelonephritis in children in Khabarovsk region].
AB  - Microflora of urinary tract was studied in 419 children aged 1 - 17 years and hospitalized due to acute or chronic pyelonephritis. Etiology of inflammatory process was established in 57.8% of cases. According to our study, etiologic structure of causative agents of pyelonephritis did not differ from all-Russian data. The leading positions belonged to Gram-negative microorganisms from Enterobacteriaceae family: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. Results of the study point to high susceptibility of main causative agents of pyelonephritis to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. High resistance to aminopenicillines was noted. In several isolates from Enterobacteriaceae family significant resistance to nalidixic acid and furazidin was observed.
TI  - [Evaluation of the Phoenix automated microbiology system for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the BD Phoenix (Beckton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, USA) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) test with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) ESBL phenotypic confirmatory test by disk diffusion (CLSI ESBL test) in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: We tested 224 clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca and P. mirabilis during May 2006 to March 2007. These isolates were examined by the Phoenix and the CLSI ESBL tests simultaneously. For the isolates showing discordant results between the two tests, boronic acid disk test was performed to differentiate AmpC beta-lactamase and ESBL. RESULTS: Among the 224 clinical isolates, 75 and 79 isolates were positive for ESBL by CLSI ESBL test and Phoenix test, respectively. Having detected 4 more isolates as ESBL-producers, Phoenix test showed a 98.2% agreement with a 100% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity compared with CLSI ESBL test. Among the four false positive isolates, three were AmpC-positive but ESBL-negative. CONCLUSIONS: The BD Phoenix ESBL test was sensitive and specific, and can be used as a rapid and reliable method to detect ESBL production in E. coli, Klebsiella species, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Optimal probe length and target location for electrochemical detection of selected uropathogens at ambient temperature.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated the clinical validity of the rapid detection of uropathogens by use of a DNA biosensor. This assay involves the hybridization of capture and detector probe pairs with bacterial 16S rRNA target molecules to form a DNA-RNA sandwich on the sensor surface. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody binds to the detector probe to enzymatically amplify the hybridization signal. These previous studies involved the hybridization of bacterial 16S rRNA target sequences with 35-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs at 65 degrees C. Achievement of point-of-care technology will be greatly facilitated by ambient-temperature detection. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of probe length and target location on signal intensity using hybridization temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees C. Signal intensity was found to vary dramatically with hybridization location in the species-specific bulge region of 16S rRNA helix 18. Probe pairs of as short as 10 nucleotides in length were able to produce a significant electrochemical signal, and signal intensity was correlated with probe length for probes of 10 to 20 nucleotides in length. The sensitivity of the Escherichia coli-specific 15-mer probe pairs was approximately 330 cells. These shorter probes allowed differentiation of Klebsiella pneumoniae from Proteus mirabilis 16S rRNA target sequences differing by a single nucleotide. A panel of oligonucleotide probe pairs ranging from 11 to 23 nucleotides in length was able to distinguish among seven groups of urinary tract pathogens. In conclusion, we have developed short oligonucleotide probe pairs for the species-specific identification of uropathogens at ambient temperature by use of an electrochemical sensor.
TI  - Afebrile emphysematous pyelonephritis.
AB  
TI  - Contemporary management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) are common in adult women across the entire age spectrum, with mean annual incidences of approximately 15% and 10% in those aged 15-39 and 40-79 years, respectively. By definition, UTIs in males or pregnant females and those associated with risk factors known to increase the risk of infection or treatment failure (e.g. acquisition in a hospital setting, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, urinary tract instrumentation/interventions, diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression) are not considered herein. The majority of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (70-95%), with Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounting for 1-2%, 1-2% and 5-10% of infections, respectively. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with uUTI are present (e.g. dysuria, frequency, back pain or costovertebral angle tenderness) and there is no vaginal discharge or irritation present, the likelihood of uUTI is >90-95%. Laboratory testing (i.e. urinary nitrites, leukocyte esterase, culture) is not necessary in this circumstance and empirical treatment can be initiated. The ever-increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance of the common uropathogens in uUTI has been and is a continuing focus of intensive study. Resistance to cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) has made the empirical use of this drug problematic in many geographical areas. If local uropathogen resistance rates to cotrimoxazole exceed 10-25%, empirical cotrimoxazole therapy should not be utilized (fluoroquinolones become the new first-line agents). In a few countries, uropathogen resistance rates to the fluoroquinolones now exceed 10-25%, rendering empirical use of fluoroquinolones problematic. With the exception of fosfomycin (a second-line therapy), single-dose therapy is not recommended because of suboptimal cure rates and high relapse rates. Cotrimoxazole and the fluoroquinolones can be administered in 3-day regimens. Nitrofurantoin, a second-line therapy, should be given for 7 days. beta-Lactams are not recommended because of suboptimal clinical and bacteriological results compared with those of non-beta-lactams. If a beta-lactam is chosen, it should be given for 7 days. Management of uUTIs can frequently be triaged to non-physician healthcare personnel without adverse clinical consequences, resulting in substantial cost savings. It can be anticipated that the optimal approach to the management of uUTIs will change substantially in the future as a consequence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Detection of a lysozyme inhibitor in Proteus mirabilis by a new reverse zymogram  method.
AB  - A reverse zymogram method for the detection of bacterial lysozyme inhibitors was  developed. This method was validated by using a periplasmic protein extract of Escherichia coli containing a known inhibitor and subsequently led to the detection of a new proteinaceous hen egg white lysozyme inhibitor in Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Surveillance study in Europe and Brazil on clinical aspects and Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology in Females with Cystitis (ARESC): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. INTERVENTION: Patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. MEASUREMENTS: This survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine European countries and in Brazil. Female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinical data of 4264 eligible patients were analysed. A positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. Within the 3018 pathogens, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (45.1%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). In all countries a susceptibility rate to E. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. The susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. They may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.
TI  - Dissemination of the CTX-M-25 family beta-lactamases among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and identification of the novel enzyme CTX-M-41 in Proteus mirabilis in Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The CTX-M-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. We aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among Enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. METHODS: Fifty-four CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(CTX-M-25) genes by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was analysed by PFGE. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by VITEK-2. Plasmids encoding bla(CTX-M-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by Southern blot using a bla(CTX-M-25) probe. Chromosomal location of bla(CTX-M-25)-type was studied by I-CeuI restriction analysis. The bla(CTX-M-25) genetic environment was characterized by PCR mapping and partial sequencing. RESULTS: Ten out of 54 CTX-M-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(CTX-M-25) genes, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Isolates were genetically unrelated. Four beta-lactamases were found: CTX-M-25, CTX-M-26, CTX-M-39 and CTX-M-41, a new member of the family (accession no. DQ023162) that differed from CTX-M-25 in three amino acids, Ala80Val, Val106Ile and Ile126Ser. bla(CTX-M-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but P. mirabilis, organized in a class I integron and located downstream of an ISEcp1 element. The genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. Several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. CONCLUSIONS: bla(CTX-M-25) exists in Israel in different enteric species. Spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. CTX-M-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of P. mirabilis.
TI  - First prize: Novel uropathogen-resistant coatings inspired by marine mussels.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Success in the prevention of urinary device infections has been elusive, largely due to multiple bacterial attachment strategies and the development of urinary conditioning films. We investigated a novel anti-fouling coating consisting of mussel adhesive protein mimics conjugated to polyethylene glycol (mPEG-DOPA(3)) for its potential to resist conditioning film formation and uropathogen attachment in human urine. METHODS: Model TiO(2) -coated silicon disks ( approximately 75 mm(2)) were either coated with mPEG-DOPA(3) or left uncoated and sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. For bacterial attachment experiments, coated and uncoated surfaces were separately challenged with bacterial strains comprising six major uropathogenic species for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in human pooled urine. Starting inoculum for each strain was 10(5) CFU/mL and 0.5 mL was used per disk. Following incubation, the disks were thoroughly rinsed in phosphate buffered saline to remove non-adherent and weakly-adherent organisms and cell scrapers were employed to dislodge those that were firmly attached. Adherent bacteria were quantitated using dilution plating. Representative disks were also examined using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and live/dead viability staining. RESULTS: The mPEG-DOPA(3) coating significantly resisted the attachment of all uropathogens tested, with a maximum >231-fold reduction in adherence for Escherichia coli GR-12, Enterococcus faecalis 23241, and Proteus mirabilis 296 compared to uncoated TiO(2) disks. Scanning electron microscopy and viability staining analyses also reflected these results and demonstrated the ability of the coating to resist urinary constituent adherence as well. CONCLUSION: Model surfaces coated with mPEG-DOPA(3) strongly resisted both urinary film formation and bacterial attachment in vitro. Future in vitro and in vivo studies will be conducted to assess whether similar findings can be demonstrated when these polymer coatings are applied to urologic devices.
TI  - Incisional surgical infection in heart transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Incisional surgical site infections (ISSIs) are common bacterial infections in heart transplantation (HT). The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, timing, and risk factors for ISSIs. METHODS: A prospective study was performed, which included all heart transplants carried out in the participating hospitals (pertaining to the Spanish National Hospital Network RESITRA) between August 2003 and February 2005. A population of 292 consecutive patients was included (84.9% males). The definition of ISSI used in the study was based on the Centers for Disease Control criteria. RESULTS: Seventeen episodes of ISSIs were recorded in 14 patients (4.8%; confidence interval [CI] 95% 2.7-7.7%). The median time from transplant to ISSI was 14 days (range 3-75). Two patients (14%) died; fatality was related to ISSI (mediastinitis) in 1 patient (7%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (7 cases), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Proteus mirabilis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata, 1 case each, were the isolated pathogens. The duration of extracorporeal circulation was longer in patients with ISSI, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin alone (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% CI, 1.2-216.9) was independently associated with the development of ISSI. CONCLUSIONS: ISSIs in HT are frequently caused by resistant bacteria and Candida, but are associated with good prognosis.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton Agar on Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - Effects of rifaximin on bacterial virulence mechanisms at supra- and sub-inhibitory concentrations.
AB  - Rifaximin, a poorly absorbed rifamycin derivative, exhibited time-dependent bactericidal activity and at concentrations as low as 1/32 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) caused morphological alterations in both susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. Spontaneous rifaximin-resistant clones appeared with an incidence of 2.6 x 10(-7). The percentage of Escherichia coli cells cured of various plasmids ranged from: 4.5-70% (Flac), 0-18% (pBP507), 7.7-43.8% (plasmid carrying ESBL genes) and 22.4-41.6% (plasmid encoding toxin from ETEC mex264). 8.4-18.2 and <0.1-18% of Staphylococcus aureus cells were cured (plasmid-mediated penicillinase), 9.5-58.6% of Morganella morganii (ESBL), 10.6-47.1% Citrobacter freundii (ESBL), 2.3-38.7% of Proteus mirabilis (ESBL) and 14.3-66.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL). Rifaximin reduced plasmid transfer from donor to recipient strains by >99%. The MIC of ceftazidime was reduced (2-4 dilutions) in the presence of rifaximin (0.5 x MIC) in ESBL producing strains. Rifaximin lowered the viability and virulence of the bacteria even though they developed resistance to the compound. In conclusion, the present findings add new features to the microbiological characteristics of rifaximin and suggest that if in vivo pathogens are exposed to sub-MICs of the drug, not only are their physiological functions compromised, but gene virulence and antibiotic resistance are not fully expressed.
TI  - Molecular survey of beta-lactamases conferring resistance to newer beta-lactams in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Polish hospitals.
AB  - The first national survey of resistance to newer beta-lactams in nosocomial populations of Enterobacteriaceae in Poland was performed. The study covered all nonrepetitive enterobacterial isolates cultured from specimens from inpatients in 13 regional secondary-care hospitals from November 2003 to January 2004. Among 2,388 isolates, the predominant species was Escherichia coli (59.6%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.5%) and Klebsiella spp. (8.5%). The frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was very high, with ESBLs present in 11.1% of all isolates and 40.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the latter value greatly exceeding that for E. coli (2.5%). The contribution of outbreak isolates was significant, resulting, for example, in a particularly high rate of ESBL producers among Serratia marcescens isolates (70.8%). The pool of ESBL types was overwhelmingly dominated (81.7%) by CTX-M-like beta-lactamases CTX-M-3 (80.6%) and CTX-M-15, with SHV types (17.5%; SHV-2, SHV-5, and SHV-12) and sporadic TEM-like enzymes (0.7%; TEM-19 and TEM-48) being the next most frequent. Acquired AmpC-type cephalosporinases were observed exclusively in P. mirabilis, in 20.5% of the isolates of this species (compared with the frequency of ESBL producers of 11.5% of P. mirabilis isolates). All these cephalosporinases (CMY-12, CMY-15, and a novel variant, CMY-38) originated from Citrobacter freundii. Four isolates of E. coli (two isolates), K. pneumoniae (one isolate), and P. mirabilis (one isolate) produced class A inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases (TEM-30, TEM-32, TEM-37, and SHV-49), being the first of such producers identified in Poland. The survey documented both specific and more global characteristics of the epidemiology of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in enterobacteria from Polish hospitals and demonstrated that the ESBL frequency has reached an alarming level.

TI  - Secondary chromosomal attachment site and tandem integration of the mobilizable Salmonella genomic island 1.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Salmonella genomic island 1 is an integrative mobilizable element (IME) originally identified in epidemic multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) DT104. SGI1 contains a complex integron, which confers various multidrug resistance phenotypes due to its genetic plasticity. Previous studies have shown that SGI1 integrates site-specifically into the S. enterica, Escherichia coli, or Proteus mirabilis chromosome at the 3' end of thdF gene (attB site). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the transfer of SGI1 to a Delta thdF mutant of S. Typhimurium LT2. In the absence of thdF, the frequency of transconjugant formation was reduced by around thirty times of magnitude. Through DNA sequencing SGI1 was shown to integrate specifically into a secondary attachment site (2(nd)attB), which is located in the intergenic region between the chromosomal sodB and purR genes. At this 2(nd)attB site, we found that a significant fraction of SGI1 transconjugants (43% of wild type and 100% of Delta thdF mutant) contained tandem SGI1 arrays. Moreover, in wild type S. Typhimurium LT2 transconjugants, SGI1 integrated into both attachment sites, i.e., thdF and sodB-purR. The formation of SGI1 tandem arrays occurred in both specific attB sites. There was heterogeneity in the size of the SGI1 tandem arrays detected in single transconjugant colonies. Some arrays consisted as far as six SGI1s arranged in tandem. These tandem arrays were shown to persist during serial passages with or without antibiotic selection pressure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The ability of integration into two distinct chromosomal sites and tandem array formation of SGI1 could contribute to its spread and persistence. The existence of a secondary attachment site in the Salmonella chromosome has potential implications for the mobility of SGI1, which may integrate in other attachment sites of other bacterial pathogens that do not possess the 1(st) or 2(nd) specific SGI1 attB sites of Salmonella.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Limited functional conservation of a global regulator among related bacterial genera: Lrp in Escherichia, Proteus and Vibrio.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial genome sequences are being determined rapidly, but few species are physiologically well characterized. Predicting regulation from genome sequences usually involves extrapolation from better-studied bacteria, using the hypothesis that a conserved regulator, conserved target gene, and predicted regulator-binding site in the target promoter imply conserved regulation between the two species. However many compared organisms are ecologically and physiologically diverse, and the limits of extrapolation have not been well tested. In E. coli K-12 the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) affects expression of approximately 400 genes. Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae have highly-conserved lrp orthologs (98% and 92% identity to E. coli lrp). The functional equivalence of Lrp from these related species was assessed. RESULTS: Heterologous Lrp regulated gltB, livK and lrp transcriptional fusions in an E. coli background in the same general way as the native Lrp, though with significant differences in extent. Microarray analysis of these strains revealed that the heterologous Lrp proteins significantly influence only about half of the genes affected by native Lrp. In P. mirabilis, heterologous Lrp restored swarming, though with some pattern differences. P. mirabilis produced substantially more Lrp than E. coli or V. cholerae under some conditions. Lrp regulation of target gene orthologs differed among the three native hosts. Strikingly, while Lrp negatively regulates its own gene in E. coli, and was shown to do so even more strongly in P. mirabilis, Lrp appears to activate its own gene in V. cholerae. CONCLUSION: The overall similarity of regulatory effects of the Lrp orthologs supports the use of extrapolation between related strains for general purposes. However this study also revealed intrinsic differences even between orthologous regulators sharing >90% overall identity, and 100% identity for the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif, as well as differences in the amounts of those regulators. These results suggest that predicting regulation of specific target genes based on genome sequence comparisons alone should be done on a conservative basis.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and electrochemistry of 4'-functionalized 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine ruthenium(II) complexes and their biological activity.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of Ru(II) terpyridine complexes derived from 4'-functionalized 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine ligands by a multi step procedure have been described. The complexes are redox-active, showing both metal-centred (oxidation) and ligand-centred (reduction) processes. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the synthesized ruthenium(II) complexes [Ru(attpy)2](PF6)2 (attpy = 4'-(4-acryloyloxymethylphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine); [Ru(mttpy)2](PF6)2 (mttpy = 4'-(4-methacryloyloxymethylphenyl)-2,2':6',2''- terpyridine); [Ru(mttpy)(MeOPhttpy)](PF6)2 (MeOPhttpy = 4'-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine); and [Ru(mttpy)(ttpy)](PF6)2 (ttpy = 4'-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine) were tested against four human pathogens (Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and five plant pathogens (Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium udum, Macrophomina phaseolina and Rhizoctonia solani) by the well diffusion method and MIC values of the complexes are reported. A biological study of the complexes indicated that the complexes [Ru(mttpy)2](PF6)2 and [Ru(mttpy)(MeOPhttpy)](PF6)2 exhibit very good activity against most of the test pathogens and their activity is better than those of some of the commercially available antibiotics like tetracycline and the fungicide carbendazim.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria identified in urine].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to evaluate the frequency of isolation and the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria responsible for urinary infections among in and out-patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Mohammed-V Military Instruction Hospital in Rabat, on bacteria isolated from 896 positive cytobacteriologic examinations of urine, from January 1 to December 31, 2005. RESULTS: Among the 7472 urinary samples, 896 answered the criteria of urinary infection (12%). Urinary infections were more frequent in in-patients (57.8%; sex-ratio F/M=1:16). Enterobacteria were the most frequent (85%) and especially Escherichia coli (44.7%). Gram positive bacteria (11.6%) were more frequently Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.1%). E. coli was highly resistant to amoxicillin, and sulfamethoxazole, whereas quinolones and aminosides maintained a good activity and third generation cephalosporines remain active (97% of susceptibility). Among the enterobacteria present, 3.2% were resistant to third generation cephalosporines with extended spectrum betalactamase.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic performance of tigecycline versus common intravenous antibiotics  for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical trials tigecycline was similar to vancomycin/aztreonam for complicated skin and skin structure infections, but data comparing it with other widely used antibiotics are lacking. We predicted the pharmacodynamic cumulative fraction of response (CFR) of tigecycline against bacteria implicated in complicated skin and skin structure infections and compared it with the CFRs for piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and imipenem/cilastatin. METHODS: A 5,000-patient Monte Carlo simulation using a two-compartment intravenous infusion model was used to simulate steady-state concentrations for common dosages of these antibiotics. Population pharmacokinetics data from infected patients were employed. The CFR was calculated against Staphylococcus aureus (42% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from worldwide surveillance (TEST and SENTRY) and weighted by prevalence of involvement in complicated skin and skin structure infections. RESULTS: Excluding MRSA, the weighted CFR was greatest for imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam regimens (93.9%-95.9%). With 42% MRSA added to the model, only tigecycline monotherapy achieved a high CFR (88.2%). The addition of vancomycin raised the CFR to 91.0%, 89.5%, 88.3%, 82.9%, and 78% for imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q6h, imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q8h, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone regimens, respectively. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline monotherapy had a likelihood of achieving its requisite pharmacodynamic exposure similar to that of combinations of piperacillin/tazobactam or imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in Taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  - A horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (RCWs) in Taiwan. Some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), were identified. Pulsotypes of ESBL-producing P. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The prevalences of MRSA, ESBL-producing E. coli (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) P. aeruginosa, MDR-PA, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and MDR-AB were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0% and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. Among the 44 respiratory isolates of P. mirabilis with an ESBL phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. Among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). High prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in RCWs.
TI  - [Etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary pathogens].
AB  - With the objective of knowing the common etiological agents in urinary infection  and comparing its antimicrobial susceptibility in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we analyse all the urine bacteriological exams from the Servico de Patologia Clinica do Centro Hospitalar do Nordeste, EPE - Unidade Hospitalar de Braganca, during a two years period (April 2004 to March 2006). During this period, 4018 urine bacteriological exams were made. The cultural exam was positive in 572 samples (144 from nosocomial infections and 428 from community-acquired urinary infections). The Escherichia coli was the more isolated strain (68,4 %), followed by Klebsiella spp (7,9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6,1%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,2%). Concerning to antimicrobial susceptibility, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp showed a high resistance to the antimicrobials Amoxicillin, Piperacillin, Cephalothin, Ceftazidim and Quinolones. For Enterobacteriaceae Imipenem, Amikacin and Netilmicin were the antimicrobials with more level of susceptibility. Imipenem and Amikacin were the more efficient antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Concerning to the susceptibility for the same etiological agent, in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we founded statistical significant differences in the antimicrobials Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and Collistin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in the group of antimicrobials from Quinolones for the Proteus mirabilis. In the other identified agents there were no statistical significant differences for antimicrobials. This study it allows making use of data necessary for the knowledge of etiologic urinary infection agents in Braganca and provides the information about the antimicrobials resistance, which were necessary to initiate an adequate empirical treatment and to elaborate treatment guides.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem in US medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of MYSTIC program surveillance.
AB  - Since 1997, the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the United States, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 Enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, and 829 Gram-positive cocci. All isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. Meropenem (MIC(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/mL) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against Enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). KPC carbapenemases, usually found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. Meropenem remained active against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; MIC(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/mL). These US MYSTIC Program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against Enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.
TI  - Identification of an inhibitor of the MurC enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  - The pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the Mur enzymes. In the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the Escherichia coli MurC (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid:L-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. Inhibition of ATP consumed during the MurC reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. After nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, C-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. The inhibition of MurC by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. C-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the E. coli MurC reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. Experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the MurC enzyme. Further work with MurC enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting MurC from genera (Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to E. coli, MurC enzymes from more distant Gram-negative species such as Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baylyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
TI  - Viper metalloproteinase (Agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. A 23.1 kDa protein was isolated from Agkistrodon halys (pallas, Chinese viper) snake venom. The toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an N-terminal sequence (MIQVLLVTICLAVFPYQGSSIILES) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the Viperidae family. The antibacterial effect of Agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (AHM) on Burkholderia pseudomallei (strains TES and KHW), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microM. Interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against S. aureus, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant B. pseudomallei (strain KHW) bacteria. AHM variants with high bacteriostatic activity (MIC 1.875-60 microM) also tended to be less cytotoxic against U-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mM concentrations. These results suggest that this metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.
TI  - Surveillance for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae within the Calgary Health Region, Canada: the emergence of aac(6')-Ib-cr.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A study was designed to determine the prevalence of plasmid-mediated  quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the Calgary Health Region (CHR). METHODS: During January and February 2004 and January and February 2007, 564 non-repeat isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or tobramycin were screened for PMQR determinants using a multiplex PCR for qnrA, qnrS and qnrB and aac(6')-Ib genes; aac(6')-Ib-cr was further identified by digestion with BstF5I. RESULTS: In 2004, 6/139 (4%) of the resistant E. coli were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr. In 2007, 53/398 (13%) were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr, 3/398 (0.8%) were positive for qnrS, and one isolate was positive for both. All the isolates were present in urines and the majority [40/63 (63%)] were submitted from community collection sites; 8 (13%) isolates co-produced AmpC beta-lactamases and 34 (54%) co-produced CTX-M-15. aac(6')-Ib-cr was present in one Klebsiella pneumoniae and one P. mirabilis, whereas one isolate of K. pneumoniae was positive for both aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that isolates with aac(6')-Ib-cr, often associated with CTX-M-15, are emerging among fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in the CHR. Our study suggests that surveillance for PMQR determinants should be undertaken on a regular basis.
TI  - Performance of chromID ESBL, a chromogenic medium for detection of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - The chromogenic agar medium chromID ESBL (bioMerieux) was compared with BLSE agar medium (AES) for selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. A total of 765 samples (468 rectal swabs, 255 urine samples and 42 pulmonary aspirations) obtained from 547 patients was processed. All bacterial strains isolated on either medium were further characterized using biochemical tests, and ESBL producers were confirmed by synergy testing. Genetic characterization of ESBL genes was determined by PCR. A total of 33 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains [Escherichia coli (n=16), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=8), Enterobacter spp. (n=3), Citrobacter spp. (n=5) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1)] was recovered. The sensitivity after 24 h incubation was 88 % for chromID ESBL and 85 % for BLSE agar. At 48 h, the sensitivity of chromID ESBL increased to 94 % and was higher than that obtained with BLSE agar. The positive predictive value at 24 h for chromID ESBL was 38.7 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 28.3 -50.2 %)], which was significantly higher than that for BLSE agar [15.4 %, 95 % CI 10.1 -21.5 %]. On both media, false-positive results were mostly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to Enterobacteriaceae overproducing chromosomal cephalosporinase (Enterobacter spp.) or a chromosomal penicillinase (Klebsiella oxytoca). This study showed that chromID ESBL, a ready-to-use chromogenic selective medium, is sensitive and specific for rapid, presumptive identification of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Its chromogenic properties and its selectivity are particularly useful in specimens containing resident associated flora.
TI  - Efficacy of ertapenem for consolidation therapy of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative infections: a case series report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are becoming increasingly common and present significant challenges in terms of treatment. Carbapenems is the antibiotic class of choice for treatment of these types of infections. Ertapenem is the newest carbapenem, capable of being dosed once daily, and has some in vitro but little in vivo evidence supporting its use for the treatment of these resistant infections. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and microbiologic outcomes associated with ertapenem therapy of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series that examined the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of 22 patients who received ertapenem for treatment of an ESBL infection at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL, during 2003-2005. RESULTS: The majority (16/22) of patients received ertapenem for consolidation rather than initial therapy. Different antibiotics most commonly used were other carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and aminoglycosides. The most common infections treated were lower urinary tract infections and osteomyelitis. Clinical efficacy was determined in all 22 patients, with 20 (91%) patients having a positive outcome, defined as either clinical improvement or clinical cure. The best clinical cure rate was seen with wound infections, where all 3 patients examined were found to be clinically cured. Microbiologic efficacy was determined in 7 patients, with 6 (85.7%) defined as microbiologic cure. One patient was found to be both a clinical and microbiologic failure and was also found to have developed an ertapenem-resistant strain of E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate potential microbiologic and clinical efficacy of ertapenem for treatment of ESBL-producing infections and the need for a prospective, randomized study examining its efficacy versus that of other carbapenems.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum  essential oils and methanol extracts.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) and methanol extracts obtained from aerial parts of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum seeds were evaluated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against nine Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The essential oils and methanol extracts revealed promising antibacterial activities against most pathogens using broth microdilution method. Maximum activity of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum essential oils and methanol extracts (MIC 15.6 and 62.5mug/ml) were observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris. Combinations of essential oils and methanol extracts showed an additive action against most tested pathogens especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (91), Escherichia coli (49), Enterobacter spp. (27), Proteus mirabilis (17), Citrobacter freundii (2), Providencia stuartii (3) and Serratia spp. (5), with various MICs of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect MBLs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. METHODS: A total of 194 (95 MBL-positive and 99 MBL-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem MICs < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/L were examined. All isolates were evaluated by the double-disc synergy test (DDST), the combination disc test (CDT), the MBL Etest and the modified Hodge test. The presence of bla(VIM) and bla(IMP) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by PCR. RESULTS: In 30 bla(VIM)-positive isolates that exhibited MICs of imipenem < or = 4 mg/L, MBL Etest could not be evaluated. CDT with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of EDTA, and DDST after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of EDTA, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. CDT with imipenem and 1900 microg of EDTA exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). CONCLUSIONS: The CDT with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 M EDTA or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 M EDTA and the DDST with imipenem 10 mm apart from EDTA are the most effective methods for the detection of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - Complicated catheter-associated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli  and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) represent the most common type of nosocomial infection and are a major health concern due to the complications and frequent recurrence. These infections are often caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Gram-negative bacterial species that cause CAUTIs express a number of virulence factors associated with adhesion, motility, biofilm formation, immunoavoidance, and nutrient acquisition as well as factors that cause damage to the host. These infections can be reduced by limiting catheter usage and ensuring that health care professionals correctly use closed-system Foley catheters. A number of novel approaches such as condom and suprapubic catheters, intermittent catheterization, new surfaces, catheters with antimicrobial agents, and probiotics have thus far met with limited success. While the diagnosis of symptomatic versus asymptomatic CAUTIs may be a contentious issue, it is generally agreed that once a catheterized patient is believed to have a symptomatic urinary tract infection, the catheter is removed if possible due to the high rate of relapse. Research focusing on the pathogenesis of CAUTIs will lead to a better understanding of the disease process and will subsequently lead to the development of new diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options.
TI  - [Prevalence and bacterial susceptibility of community acquired urinary tract infection in University Hospital of Brasilia, 2001 to 2005].
AB  - Urinary tract infection is among the most common infectious diseases in clinical  medicine, and knowledge of its epidemiology and the sensitivity profile of the etiological agents is mandatory. The aim of this study was to identify the most frequent etiological agents and the profile of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents of the bacteria isolated from urine cultures from outpatients at the University Hospital of Brasilia between 2001 and 2005. From analyses at the hospitals microbiology laboratory, there were 2,433 positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacteria (62.4%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%) and Proteus mirabilis (4.7%). Escherichia coli showed the highest sensitivity to amikacin (98.6%), gentamicin (96.2%), nitrofurantoin (96.3%) and the quinolones ciprofloxacin (90.9%) and norfloxacin (89.8%), with low sensitivity to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (50.6%). The others bacteria presented similar sensitivity profiles. In conclusion, Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacteria, and it was highly sensitive to aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin and quinolones.
TI  - The high-affinity phosphate transporter Pst is a virulence factor for Proteus mirabilis during complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a ubiquitous bacterium associated with complicated urinary tract infection (UTI). Mutagenesis studies of the wild-type strain HI4320 in the CBA mouse model of ascending UTIs have identified attenuated mutants with transposon insertions in genes encoding the high-affinity phosphate transporter Pst (pstS, pstA). The transcription of the pst operon (pstSCAB-phoU) and other members of the phosphate regulon of Escherichia coli, including alkaline phosphatase (AP), are regulated by the two-component regulatory system PhoBR and are repressed until times of phosphate starvation. This normal suppression was relieved in pstS::Tn5 and pstA::Tn5 mutants, which constitutively produced AP regardless of growth conditions. No significant growth defects were observed in vitro for the pst mutants during the independent culture or coculture studies in rich broth, phosphate-limiting minimal salts medium, or human urine. Mutants complemented with the complete pst operon repressed AP synthesis in vitro and colonized the mouse bladder in numbers comparable to the wild-type strain HI4320. Therefore, the Pst transport system imparts a significant in vivo advantage to wild-type P. mirabilis that is not required for in vitro growth. Thus, the Pst transporter has satisfied molecular Koch's postulates as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection caused by P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Aegle marmelos against leaf, bark and fruit extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts from  the leaves, bark and fruit of A. marmelos was studied using disc diffusion method against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram Positive), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella paratyphi B (Gram Negative). Results suggest that the methanolic extract has significant antibacterial activity against tested bacteria. The present study justifies the claimed uses of A. marmelos in the traditional system of medicine to treat various infectious diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Ocimum gratissimum L. From different  populations of Kenya.
AB  - Hydro-distilled volatile oils from the leaves of Ocimum gratissimum L. (Lamiaceae) of 13 populations of different silvicultural zones were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (Staphylococcus aereus, Bacillus spp.) and gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Samonella typhi, Klebisiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria and a pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans. All the essential oils are active to the tested microbiles with different strength. The highest antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosae and Proteus mirabilis) was observed from the eastern Kenya (Meru) oil. Meru oil was the best and its effectiveness was consistent on nearly all the microbes tested. The oil from the plant growing in the coastal region of Kenya (Mombasa) showed the best effect only on gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Both oils (Meru and Mombasa) were dominated by monoterpenes accounting for 92.48% and 81.37% respectively. The monoterpene fraction was characterized by a high percentage of eugenol (68.8%) for Meru oil and 74.10% for Mombasa oil. The other major monoterpene was methyl eugenol (13.21%). Camphor (0.95%) was observed only in the Meru oil. (Cis)-Ocimene, (trans)-ocimene and beta-pinene were present in both Meru and Mombasa oils. The sesquiterpenes present in fairly good amounts in both oils were germacrene D and (trans)-caryophyllene. The minor sesquiterpenes were alpha-farnesene (0.85%) and beta-bisabolene (0.74%) which were present in the Meru oil only.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial intrahospital infections in newborns].
AB  - Nosocomial infections are important problem for the modern medicine. Especially sensitive category, susceptible to nosocomial infections, are the infants. The aim of the research was to establish an active monitoring over the breaking out of the nosocomial infections in the Neonatology Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of the University Clinical Center Tuzla (UKC) and to determine the kind of bacteria that causes the nosocomial infections as well as the type of infection according to anatomical localization. The research encompassed 8000 of newborn infants at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in the years 2005 and 2006. The determining of the nosocomial infections was done by using the standard CDC criteria. The results show that in two researching years the leading nosocomial infections were bacteriemia, followed by other infections, respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The mostly identified carrier of the nosocomial infections in 2005 were gram-positive bacteria (65,5%): coagulase-negative staphylococci was isolated in 54,6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5,5% and Streptococcus species in 5,5% of cases (p<0,001). The isolated gram-negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2005 were Klebisiella pneumoniae (21,8%), Escherichia coli (5,5%), Pseudomanas aeruginosa (3,6%) and Morganella morganii (3,6%) (p<0,05). In 2006 the mostly identified and isolated carriers of nosocomial infections were gram positive bacteria (64,2%): coagulase-negative Staphylococci (43,3%), Streptococcus species (13,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7,5%) (p<0,001). Gram negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2006 were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19,4%), Escherichia coli (10,5%), Acinetobacter species (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,5%) and Proteus mirabilis (1,5%) (p<0,05). The bacteriemia was mostly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Infections of the urinary tract were caused by gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Other infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Infections of the respiratory tract were caused by Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most frequent carriers of the nosocomial infections at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in 2005 and 2006 was gram-positive bacteria-coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
TI  - Occurrence of Proteus mirabilis associated with two species of venezuelan oysters.
AB  - The fecal contamination of raw seafood by indicators and opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms represents a public health concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of enteric bacteria colonizing oysters collected from a Venezuelan touristic area. Oyster samples were collected at the northwestern coast of Venezuela and local salinity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen of seawater were recorded. Total and fecal coliforms were measured for the assessment of the microbiological quality of water and oysters, using the Multiple Tube Fermentation technique. Analyses were made using cultures and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diverse enrichment and selective culture methods were used to isolate enteric bacteria. We obtained pure cultures of Gram-negative straight rods with fimbriae from Isognomon alatus and Crassostrea rhizophorae. Our results show that P. mirabilis was predominant under our culture conditions. We confirmed the identity of the cultures by biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and data analysis. Other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also isolated from seawater and oysters. The presence of pathogenic bacteria in oysters could have serious epidemiological implications and a potential human health risk associated with consumption of raw seafood.
TI  - Fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. The  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. In this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with Fournier's gangrene. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with Fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. RESULTS: The 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. The mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. Overall mortality was 22.7%. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. Liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). The etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. The most common isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp., and Proteus mirabilis. There were a total of 74 debridements. Other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). Major complications of Fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock, hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. Liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. Reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. Patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and six comparator drugs against 423 aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates from infected diabetic foot wounds.
AB  - Against 182 anaerobe and 241 aerobe strains obtained from diabetic foot infections, doripenem was the most active carbapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis, and ertapenem was more active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were < or =0.125 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and all streptococci and 0.25/1 for Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Activities of the frog skin peptide, ascaphin-8 and its lysine-substituted analogs against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and their antibiotic resistance necessitates novel therapeutic intervention. Ascaphin-8 is a cationic alpha-helical peptide that shows broad-spectrum antibacterial activity but is also toxic to human erythrocytes (LC(50)= 55 microM). This study assesses the activity of ascaphin-8, and a series of l-lysine-substituted analogs, against a range of clinical isolates of ESBL-producing bacteria. All ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (MIC=1.5-6 microM) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC=12.5-25 microM) strains tested were susceptible to ascaphin-8, as well as a group of miscellaneous ESBL-producing strains (Citrobacter, Salmonella, Serratia, Shigella spp.) (MIC< or = 25 microM). The Lys4- and Lys8-substituted analogs were generally the most potent against bacteria but showed the highest hemolytic activity. However, the Lys10, Lys14, and Lys18 analogs also displayed potent antibacterial activity while showing very low hemolytic activity (LC50> 500 microM). An unexpected finding was the susceptibility of ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis strains to ascaphin-8 (MIC=12.5-25 microM) and its Lys4-substituted analog (MIC= 6 microM), although non-ESBL isolates of this organism were resistant to these peptides (MIC> 100 microM).
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC production  in selected clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis, and compared the results of boronic acid disc screening with conventional susceptibility testing for the detection of AmpC-positive isolates. METHODS: E coli, Klebsiella species and P mirabilis with reduced susceptibility to amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and cephalexin, but without phenotypic evidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were screened for AmpC activity using enzyme-extraction methods. The presence of plasmid-mediated ampC was determined by multiplex PCR. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using both disc and dilution-based methods. A disc-based screening method for detection of AmpC-producing strains was evaluated using boronic acid as an inhibitor of AmpC, and cefoxitin as the antibiotic substrate. RESULTS: Plasmid-mediated ampC was present in 26% of study isolates, with CMY-like enzymes detected predominantly in E coli and DHA-like enzymes predominantly in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Current susceptibility methods failed to detect a significant proportion of plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing isolates, with 33% of such strains interpreted as susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins using current Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. The boronic acid disc method showed sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 98% respectively in detecting AmpC-positive isolates. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampC was high in the study population, and may be missed by conventional susceptibility testing methods. Inhibitor-based screening methods would improve detection of this emerging resistance phenotype.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  - The aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (CBM) and nosocomial meningitis (NM) within 17 years nationwide survey. All cases of gram-negative bacillary CBM within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were CBM. Those 24 cases were compared with all CBM (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. Among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, A. baumannii in 23 cases, Ps. aeruginosa in 15 cases and Enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. Among CBM, in 13 cases Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli 6, Klebsiella pneumoniae 3, Proteus mirabilis 2, Enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases Ps. aeruginosa and in 6 cases Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The only significant risk factor for CBM due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. However, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.
TI  - The clinical development and launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment  of a range of community-acquired infections.
AB  - By the 1960s and 1970s, problems in the antibacterial treatment of infections had begun to emerge. Previously active antibacterials were being compromised by the development of resistance. Beta-lactamase production was identified in isolates of staphylococci, and, amongst others, in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The discovery of the potent beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, and its protective effect on amoxicillin, a semi-synthetic penicillin with good oral absorption and potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, was thus of great importance in the treatment of bacterial disease. Following preliminary clinical studies in bronchitis and urinary tract infections, amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was investigated in a wide range of infections and proved to demonstrate a high level of clinical efficacy. These results supported the launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) in 1981 for use in upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and obstetric, gynaecological and intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - [Integrons and their relationship with resistance phenotype in Gram negative bacilli isolated in the Hospital Torres Galdames, Iquique, Chile].
AB  - The antimicrobial resistance is coded in genetic elements which generate a horizontal flow of information, particularly in conditions that are under strong selective pressure like the nosocomial environment. In that sense, in the last decades, gram negative bacilli have become important agents of nosocomial infection. In order to investigate the presence of integrons among clinical isolates of gram negative bacilli and their relationship with their resistance profile, we studied 88 strains isolated from clinical specimens of different wards of the Hospital Torres Galdames, during the June-December period, 2004. They were identified according to biochemical tests. The antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by agar diffusion method. The integron presence was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A cluster analysis was carried out to study the relationship between the presence of integrons and the resistance profile. The genotyping of the isolates was carried out by ERIC-PCR technique. RESULTS: Of the isolated strains, 18% corresponded to Proteus mirabilis, 17% to Escherichia coli, and 32% to Non Fermentative Gram Negative bacilli. Most isolates presented high resistance to the antibiotics studied: 83% to ampicillin, 85% to cephalotin, 82% to ceftriaxone, 82% to ciprofloxacin, 81% to gentamycin and 82% to cotrimoxazole. Seventy-five % of the 88 strains presented integrons. Class 2 integrons were found to be the most common. The results of the cluster analysis did not show a clear relationship among the presence of the integrons and the resistance profile. With the available information it is not possible to relate the integron presence with a certain resistance pattern. The patterns of bands obtained with the technique ERIC-PCR revealed a great genetic variety among the analyzed isolations, defining diverse genotypes, distributed in the different services of the hospital where they were isolated.
TI  - Species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  - Previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of Proteus mirabilis. In the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, P. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. Little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which P. mirabilis encrusts catheters. In the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as Providencia stuartii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with P. mirabilis, when Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii or Enterobacter cloacae were present, P. mirabilis was rarely or never found. The hypothesis that the absence of P. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. Experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of P. mirabilis with M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli had no effect on the ability of P. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. Co-infection with Ent. cloacae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly increased the time that catheters took to block (P <0.05). The growth of Ent. cloacae, M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with P. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. In the case of Ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (P < or =0.01). In all cases, however, P. mirabilis was able to generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. The results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between P. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with P. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.
TI  - Use of in vitro susceptibility and pathogen prevalence data to model the expected clinical success rates of tigecycline and other commonly used antimicrobials for empirical treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - The overall expected coverage for tigecycline and selected antimicrobial regimens based upon prevailing susceptibility rates was evaluated for the empirical therapy of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs). Consecutive, non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from 2000-2005 from patients with documented cSSSI in 57 medical centres located in the USA (38 centres), France (6 centres), Germany (7 centres), Italy (3 centres) and Spain (3 centres) were used to evaluate the frequency of pathogen occurrence and susceptibility rates of select parenteral antimicrobials (SENTRY Program). By applying pathogen-specific susceptibility rates to the frequency of pathogen occurrence in each country, the overall expected coverage for each treatment regimen was measured. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (33.3-49.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3-17.2%), Escherichia coli (6.6-13.9%) and enterococci (4.1-8.8%). Tigecycline was highly active against the most common pathogens, except for P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The highest overall expected empirical coverage was obtained with combination therapy regimens, including vancomycin plus either imipenem (94.4-99.3%) or piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5-98.2%). Among the monotherapy regimens evaluated, tigecycline provided the highest overall expected coverage in the USA (90.6%), France (89.9%) and Italy (83.3%), whilst piperacillin/tazobactam showed the highest expected coverage in Germany (93.1%) and imipenem in Spain (87.7%). Our results suggest that tigecycline represents a viable additional option for the empirical treatment of cSSSI in these countries.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (Actichelated propolis).
AB  - AIMS: This study compared in vitro activities of Actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater potency of Actichelated propolis (MIC range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (MIC range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). Concentrations of Actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. Preincubation of Strep. pyogenes and H. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of Actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x MIC) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Anti-amebic antibody activity in patients, determined with antigens prepared from virulent parasites (indirect hemagglutination assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serology of amebiasis is affected by low sensitivity and specificity. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the advantage of the indirect hemagglutination assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the diagnosis of amebiasis, using Entamoeba histolytica soluble antigen (macerated amebic antigens) prepared from four different virulent isolates, continuously cultivated in the presence of the original enteric bacteria. METHODS: Using IHA and ELISA with MAA antigen we examined 147 sera samples from patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, and 11 sera from amebiasis cases (confirmed by microscopy and copro-antigen ELISA). RESULTS: Of 104 of the 147 (70.7%) symptomatic cases that were amebiasis positive by IHA, 81 (55.1%) were positive by MAA-ELISA. In addition, of 11 amebiasis cases confirmed by microscopy and copro-antigen ELISA, 7 (64%) were amebiasis positive by both tests. Four species of bacteria were isolated from the ameba cultures: Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus lactis. Elimination of the bacteria from the cultures by an antibiotics cocktail containing gentamicin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was the preferred method. Absorption of patients' sera to bacterial antigen prior to serological analysis had only a marginal effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a correlation of 61% between the ELISA developed in this study and the IHA tests in the diagnosis of amebiasis.
TI  - Bacterial defluorination of 4-fluoroglutamic acid.
AB  - Fluorinated amino acids are used as enzyme inhibitors, mechanistic probes and in  the production of pharmacologically active peptides. Because enantiomerically pure 4-fluoroglutamate is difficult to prepare, the selective degradation of the L-isomer is a potentially convenient method of obtaining D-4-fluoroglutamate from the racemate. In this paper, we describe our investigations on the degradation of 4-fluoroglutamate by bacteria. Fluoride ion was detected in resting-cell cultures of a number of bacteria that were incubated with racemic 4-fluoroglutamate. Analysis of the culture supernatants by chiral gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that only the L-isomer was degraded. The degradation of 4-fluoroglutamate was also examined in cell-free extracts of Streptomyces cattleya and Proteus mirabilis, and it was observed that equimolar concentrations of fluoride ion and ammonia were generated. The activity was located in the soluble fraction of cell extracts, thus is not related to the L-2-amino-4-chloro-4-pentenoic acid dehydrochlorinase previously identified in membrane fractions of P. mirabilis.
TI  - First report of the emergence of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) as the predominant ESBL isolated in a U.S. health care system.
AB  - CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have become increasingly common worldwide, with the notable exception of the United States, where TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs have appeared to predominate. We have noted the emergence of ESBLs in our health care system (the University Health System in San Antonio, TX), especially in Escherichia coli isolates, that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime rather than ceftazidime, suggesting the possibility of CTX-M-type enzymes. Microbiology laboratory records were reviewed to identify ESBL-producing isolates and to compare the diameters of ceftazidime disk diffusion zones of inhibition to cefotaxime zone diameters. All isolates had been initially detected and confirmed using the procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. A total of 94 stored ESBL-producing isolates recovered between January 2000 and June 2006 (predominately from blood and normally sterile fluids) were retrieved for further study and screened using PCR primers specific for the presence of CTX-M, TEM, and SHV ESBLs. Only small numbers of retained ESBL-producing isolates were available for study in 2000 and 2002. The percentages of available ESBL-producing organisms in the following years were found to produce CTX-M enzymes: 2000, 25%; 2001, 10%; 2002, 0%; 2003, 60%; 2004, 69%; 2005, 89%; and 2006, 70%. The most common CTX-M-type ESBL was CTX-M-15, followed by CTX-M-16, CTX-M-8, and CTX-M-14. Comparing the disk diffusion zone diameters of cefotaxime and ceftazidime was helpful with the initial recognition of CTX-M-producing E. coli, which had an average cefotaxime zone diameter 7 mm smaller than the ceftazidime zone. However, comparing ceftazidime and cefotaxime zones for CTX-M-producing Klebsiella spp. was not helpful with initial recognition. CTX-M enzymes were also identified in Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of the E. coli isolates, the CTX-M-producing isolates did not represent the spread of a single clone in the institution or in the community. In conclusion, CTX-M-type ESBLs are now the most common ESBL type isolated from patients in our health care system and may also be present but unrecognized in other U.S. locales.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - Aggregative adherence of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis to cultured epithelial cells.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is an important cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with complicated urinary tracts. Thirty-five strains of P. mirabilis isolated from UTI were examined for the adherence capacity to epithelial cells. All isolates displayed the aggregative adherence (AA) to HEp-2 cells, a phenotype similarly presented in LLC-MK(2) cells. Biofilm formation on polystyrene was also observed in all strains. The mannose-resistant Proteus-like fimbriae (MR/P), Type I fimbriae and AAF/I, II and III fimbriae of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli were searched by the presence of their respective adhesin-encoding genes. Only the MR/P fimbrial subunits encoding genes mrpA and mrpH were detected in all isolates, as well as MR/P expression. A mutation in mrpA demonstrated that MR/P is involved in aggregative adherence to HEp-2 cells, as well as in biofilm formation. However, these phenotypes are multifactorial, because the mrpA mutation reduced but did not abolish both phenotypes. The present results reinforce the importance of MR/P as a virulence factor in P. mirabilis due to its association with AA and biofilm formation, which is an important step for the establishment of UTI in catheterized patients.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  - Uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from April 1997 to March 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. The various isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial UTI exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. Culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.
TI  - Investigation of essential oil extracts from four native Jamaican species of Bursera for antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection with organisms resistant to antibiotics have increased during the last few decades worldwide. Because of this increase, the authors decided to subject the essential oils from the stem, leaves and fruits of the four native Jamaica species of Bursera to microbial studies. METHODS: Steam distillate extracts from different parts of four native Jamaican spp of Bursera simaruba (Red Birch), Bursera lunanii (Black Birch), Bursera hollickii and Bursera aromatica (Siboney) were tested for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogens: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylocococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A (BHSA) using a disk diffusion assay. RESULTS: The investigation revealed that extracts from two of the four plants tested were active against all the pathogens. These were extracts from the fruits and stems of B. simaruba and those from the fruit of B. lunanii. CONCLUSION: This study gives credence to the ongoing search for locally available plants whose extracts possess significant antimicrobial activity. This may be useful in the development of naturally derived pharmaceuticals.
TI  - [Comparison of susceptibilities for fosfomycin determined by various methods in clinical isolates in 2003 -2004].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities for fosfomycin (FOM), cephalexin, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, cefditren, ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, imipenem (IPM), panipenem, meropenem (MEPM), biapenem, levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin, pazufloxacin, prulifloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were determined by an agar dilution method using Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Proteus mirabilis, which were isolated from patients in 2003-2004. Those for FOM were determined by the agar dilution methods using MHA containing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) under aerobic conditions, MHA under anaerobic conditions and nutrient agar under aerobic conditions. Those for FOM, LVFX, IPM and MEPM were also determined by an Etest method. The results by the agar dilution method showed that carbapenems had good antibacterial activities in all isolates, whereas MIC ranges for other antimicrobials were broad. Our results showed that the agar dilution method for FOM using MHA containing G6P under aerobic conditions provided reliable MICs in E. coli, which agreed with data previously reported. The results by the agar dilution method for LVFX, IPM and MEPM showed the high rate of agreement compared with those by the Etest method. In E. coli, the results for FOM by the agar dilution method using MHA containing G6P showed the high rate of agreement compared with the Etest results, although the rate was affected by bacterial species and culture conditions in various ways.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in Cameroon. OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in Yaounde Central Hospital Laboratory of Bacteriology. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in Yaounde Central Hospital Laboratory of Bacteriology between March 1995 and April 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: High rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. Resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). Susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for Escherichia coli, = 71% for Klebsiella spp., = 98% for Proteus mirabilis, = 50% for Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas Acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). Imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). Susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in Cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.
TI  - Convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - Although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the CLSI currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of MBLs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (DDTs) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and Tris-EDTA (TE) to detect MBLs. Sixteen isolates (4 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens isolate, 1 Aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 Aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 Chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing IMP-1, IMP-1-like, IMP-18, GIM-1, SPM-1, VIM-2, VIM-2-like, and chromosomal MBLs and 20 isolates (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 5 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 S. marcescens isolates, 1 Proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 A. baumannii isolates) producing non-MBL carbapenemases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. The DDT method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (TE, high-strength TE, MPA, and TE plus 20 microl of MPA [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), ertapenem (ERT), and ceftazidime (CAZ). DDTs with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 1:320 MPA detected all MBLs and yielded no false-positive results. Some, but not all, MBL producers were detected in IPM-based tests involving the single chelator TE or MPA alone or by ERT- or CAZ-based tests. IPM-based tests with MPA concentrations other than 1:320 and all MEM-based tests had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. DDT with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 MPA appears to be convenient for the detection of MBLs in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of community-acquired urinary tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents in Spain: a comparative multicenter study (2002-2004).
AB  - The susceptibility patterns of 2724 uropathogens isolated in 9 Spanish regions during 2002, and 3013 obtained in 2004 were determined. The antibiotics tested were fosfomycin trometamol, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefixime, cefuroxime-axetil, pipemidic, ceprofloxacin, trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin. Escherichia coli was the main pathogen in both studies (73% vs. 68.3%) followed by Proteus mirabilis 7.2% vs. 6.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4% vs. 5.2%). Enteroccocus spp. (4.7% vs. 6.8%), Streptoccocus agalactiae (1.7% vs. 3.1%) and Staphyloccocus saprophyticus (0.7% vs. 1.3%)were the most frequent Gram-positive pathogens. 31.3% of E. coli in 2002 and 32% in 2004 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Around 40% of E. coli were resistant to a single agent. 21.6-24.1% were resistant to two antibiotics. 35.4% of first period isolates, and 37.6% of second period ones were resistant to two or more classes of antibiotics. Fosfomycin (2.1- 2.8%) and nitrofurantoin (3.5-5.7%) had the lowest resistance rates for E. coli. Amoxicillin (58.2-58.7%), co-trimoxazole (30.8-33.8%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6-22.7%) showed the highest resistance rates, and their suitability as empiric treatments for UTI should probably be re-evaluated.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
TI  - A comparative assessment of the antimicrobial effects of garlic (Allium sativum)  and antibiotics on diarrheagenic organisms.
AB  - Antimicrobial sensitivity tests were carried out on Escherichia coli, Shigella sp, Salmonella sp, and Proteus mirabilis using standard procedures. Significant differences (p < 0.01) were seen in the effect of the antimicrobial agents (garlic, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin), and in the sensitivities of the microbial species (p < 0.01) to the antimicrobial agents were observed. The gram-negative diarrheagenic pathogens from the stool samples were highly sensitive to garlic, while ciprofloxacin (CPX) was most effective against E. coli. The differences were inferred to result from genetic differences among the organisms and differences in the modes of action of the antibiotics. No isolates were resistant to garlic, making it a promising antimicrobial agent. It appears that antibiotics that interfere with DNA and RNA syntheses, such as garlic does, could constitute an effective partner in the synergic effect of garlic currently being investigated worldwide.
TI  - [Biological hazards in air at municipal waste landfills].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the microbiological air quality at the selected municipal waste landfills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted during the summer at two municipal landfills. Air samples were collected on agar plates. The evaluation was based on the concentration levels of airborne bacteria and fungi and the identification of isolated strains. RESULTS: The total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the level of 10(3) cfu/m3. The highest concentrations of bacteria in air were observed during unloading, disposing and compacting of municipal wastes (landfill 1 - 6,1 x 10(3) cfu/ml, landfill 2 - 5,4 x 10(2) cfu/m3). The highest concentrations of fungi in air were observed at filled up parts of the landfills (landfill 1 - 4,8 x 10(2) cfu/m3, landfill 2 - 1,2 x 10(3) cfu/m3). The qualitative analysis of the air samples indicated the presence of 21 bacterial and fungi. Among of them bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans are classified as harmful biological agents. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of bacteria and fungi in air samples collected at the selected municipal waste landfills did not exceed the reference values. The concentration levels of bioaerosols are diversified according to the size of the landfill, the total number of accumulated wastes and the level of area usage. It is suggested using by municipal waste workers personal protective equipment, especially for respiratory airways and skin and also keeping the rules of individual hygiene.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Simvastatin improves the healing of infected skin wounds of rats.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study explores the potential of the simvastatin to ameliorate inflammation and infection in open infected skin wounds of rats. METHODS: Fourteen Wistar rats weighing 285 +/- 12g were used. The study was done in a group whose open infected skin wounds were treated with topical application of simvastatin microemulsion (SIM, n=7) and a second group with wounds treated with saline 0.9 % (SAL, n=7). A bacteriological exam of the wounds fluid for gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the tecidual expression of TNFa and IL-1a by immunohistochemical technique, and histological analysis by HE stain were performed. RESULTS: The expression of TNFa could be clearly demonstrated in lower degree in skin wounds treated with simvastatin (668.6 +/- 74.7 im(2)) than in saline (2120.0 +/-327.1 im(2)). In comparison, wound tissue from SIM group displayed leukocyte infiltration significantly lower than that observed in SAL group (p<0.05). Culture results of the samples taken from wound fluid on fourth post treatment day revealed wound infection in only one rat of group simvastatin (SIM), where Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp were isolated. In the rats whose wounds were treated with saline (SAL), polymicrobial infection with more than 100,000 CFU/g was detected in all the wounds. CONCLUSION: In addition to its antiinflammatory properties, the protective effects of simvastatin in infected open skin wounds is able to reduce infection and probably has antibacterial action. The potential to treat these wounds with statins to ameliorate inflammation and infection is promising.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - Increasing resistance according to patient's age and sex in Escherichia coli isolated from urine in Italy.
AB  - The prevalence of Escherichia coli among the uropathogens routinely isolated in non-hospital laboratories (Labs) and its susceptibility profiles were investigated. Thirty-three Labs were selected throughout Italy. In vitro assays were performed by means of disk diffusion according to the CLSI. Females were prevalent (79.9%) and the mean patient age was 58.6 (sd 20.4) years. Overall, the prevalence of E. coli was 55.3% (1375 strains), with Enterococcus spp 10.2 %, Proteus mirabilis 4.8%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 4.3% and Klebsiella 3.8% being the next most frequently encountered species. High compliance with quality control program was observed. Susceptibility figures in E. coli were consistently low for many antimicrobial agents such as ampicillin (51.3%) and co-trimoxazole (74.6%) and higher for others such as gentamicin (87.9%) and ceftazidime (95.1%). Resistance rates were higher among male patients and increased according to the patient's age.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftibuten at sub-inhibitory concentrations in comparison with other antibiotics against respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Some new features of the in vitro activity of ceftibuten, an oral third generation cephalosporin, have been studied in reference to respiratory and urinary tract pathogens included in its antibacterial spectrum. At 0.25XMIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and 0.5XMIC levels, ceftibuten was able to affect the biofilm production in 2/3 of both Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains, and reduced the number of strains capable of adhering to epithelial cells by about 35% in comparison to the control. Surface hydrophobicity was also influenced by ceftibuten and the other drugs at 0.25-0.5XMIC. In general, no marked variation in the virulence traits of the pathogens studied were found by exposing bacteria to sub-MICs of ceftibuten. Plasmid loss (from 1.8 to 37.2%), and Flac transfer inhibition (about 30-50% reduction in the number of recombinants) were detected under the experimental conditions used. This study confirms the excellent antibacterial properties of ceftibuten by adding new information about the effects of this antibiotic against pathogens often involved in respiratory and urinary tract infections that may be treated with this compound, supporting the appropriate use of this cephalosporin.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial profiles of selected isoquinoline alkaloids from Fumaria and Corydalis species.
AB  - In the current study, 33 isoquinoline alkaloids belonging to protopine-, benzylisoquinoline-, benzophenanthridine-, spirobenzylisoquinoline-, phthalideisoquinoline-, aporphine-, protoberberine-, cularine-, and isoquinolone-types as well as 7 derivatives of them obtained from some Fumaria and Corydalis species growing in Turkey have been evaluated for their in vitro antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madine-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines and their maximum non-toxic concentrations (MNTC) and cytopathogenic effects (CPE) were determined using acyclovir and oseltamivir as the references. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the alkaloids were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans by the microdilution method and compared to ampicilline, ofloxacine, and ketocanazole as the references. The alkaloids did not present any notable antibacterial effect, while they had significant antifungal activity at 8 microg/ml concentration. On the other hand, the alkaloids were found to have selective inhibition against the PI-3 virus ranging between 0.5 and 64 microg/ml as minimum and maximum CPE inhibitory concentrations, whereas they were completely inactive towards HSV.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two Brazilian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable AIM: The routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two Brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period METHODS: Aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures RESULTS: A contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - Predictors of mortality in patients with bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: importance of inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms markedly increase the rates of treatment failure and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to identify risk factors for mortality in adult in-patients with BSI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-BSI). Particular attention was focused on defining the impact on the mortality of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (defined as the initiation of treatment with active antimicrobial agents >72 h after collection of the first positive blood culture). A total of 186 patients with ESBL-BSI caused by Escherichia coli (n = 104), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 58), or Proteus mirabilis (n = 24) were identified by our microbiology laboratory from 1 January 1999 through 31 December 2004. The overall 21-day mortality rate was 38.2% (71 of 186). In multivariate analysis, significant predictors of mortality were inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 6.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18 to 12.42; P < 0.001) and unidentified primary infection site (OR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.38 to 5.27; P = 0.004). The inadequately treated patients (89 of 186 [47.8%]) had a threefold increase in mortality compared to the adequately treated group (59.5% versus 18.5%; OR = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.76 to 3.22; P < 0.001). The regimens most commonly classified as inadequate were based on oxyimino cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone therapy. Prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial treatment is essential in patients with ESBL-BSI, and empirical decisions must be based on a sound knowledge of the local distribution of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns.
TI  - Potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
AB  - The spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. Consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial SSTI in >70 medical centers participating in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in North America (37.4%), Europe (26.7%), Latin America (16.7%), and the Asia-Pacific region (19.2%). All isolates were tested using the reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for SSTI. Ranking pathogens producing SSTI during these years included Staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), Escherichia coli (9.0%), Enterococcus spp. (7.3%), Klebsiella spp. (4.8%), Enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and Acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). Garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against S. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (MIC(50), 0.06 mg/L) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (MIC(50), 0.25 mg/L). Furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. Garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against P. aeruginosa. In summary, garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key Gram-positive pathogens (S. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents against other species (Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.). These in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in SSTI, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.
TI  - [Evaluation of Vitek 2 performance for identifying extended spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae "other than Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp"].
AB  - Production of beta-lactamases is the main resistance mechanism of gram-negative bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have the ability to hydrolyze a broader spectrum of beta-lactam drugs. Hence rapid, accurate detection of this resistance mechanism is extremely important to guide proper patient antimicrobial therapy. These enzymes are most commonly produced by Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, but may also occur widely in other gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens and others that also produce other chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes, like AmpC beta-lactamases. The main problem is that no CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) recommendations exist for ESBL detection for Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp and for detecting plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. We carried out an evaluation of Vitek 2 Advanced Expert System (AES) performance for identifying ESBL in Enterobacteriaceae, also other than E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp, comparing results obtained with Etest and double disk data. Seventy isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were tested for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by using Vitek 2, Etest and the double disk method. The use of Etest was performed as a gold standard method by comparing interpretation results of Vitek 2 Advanced Expert System (AES). In comparison with the Etest method, AES produced 19 ESBL warnings, of which only 5 were classified as major misunderstandings, especially for Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp which produced plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. The Etest, together with the cefoxitin sensibility test, was found to be the best method to confirm ESBLs and distinguish AmpC from ESBLs.
TI  - An in vitro assessment of the antibacterial effect of garlic (Allium sativum) on  bacterial isolates from wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Garlic (Allium sativum) has come to be seen as an all rounded treatment for preventing wound infection, common cold, malaria, cough and lung tuberculosis, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, mental illness, kidney diseases, liver diseases, asthma, diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial effect of crude preparation of garlic on bacterial isolates from the wound infections. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted in Gondar University Teaching Hospital School of Medical Laboratory Technology, Microbiology Laboratory from June 2004 to April 2005 by agar dilution technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of garlic to control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATTCC 25922, as well as to clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using agar dilution method The data was collected in triplicate. RESULTS: All the tested organisms were inhibited by 33.75 mg/ml of the crude preparation of garlic except control organism and clinical isolates of S. aureus, which were inhibited by 11.25 mg/ml of crude garlic. Garlic did not reveal bactericidal effect up to a concentration of 37.5 mg/ml against all the tested organisms. CONCLUSION: Crude preparation of garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the tested organisms. Nevertheless, clinical trial on the effect of garlic is essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
TI  - Phytochemisty and spermatogenic potentials of aqueous extract of Cissus populnea  (Guill. and Per) stem bark.
AB  - In vivo clinical trials involving the administration of crude extracts of Cissus  populnea to male subjects (normospermic, oligospermic, and azoopermic) in a 72-day study revealed that continuous exposure of the subjects to the extracts over this period did not significantly (p < or = 0.05) alter sperm count, morphology, motility, or volume. Antimicrobial screening of the extract against some selected microbial isolates secondarily implicated in male infertility revealed total inactivity against the microbial isolates screened, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Klebsiella sp. Phytochemistry revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and steroids. The presence of these secondary metabolites was confirmed by thin layer chromatography. We conclude that oral administration of aqueous extracts of the stem bark of Cisssus populnea over a 72-day period to human subjects apparently had no fertility enhancement effects on sperm parameters monitored in this study.
TI  - Surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and routine use of contact isolation: experience from a three-year period.
AB  - The usefulness and applicability of isolation precautions were questioned for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae in the endemic setting. We performed a surveillance programme for ESBL-positive organisms and the infection control management of patients colonized or infected with these organisms. Between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004, a total of 147 cases of ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis from 123 patients were noted. The overall incidence of ESBL-producing-strain-positive cases was 0.12/1000 patient-days. The proportion of referred cases was 35% (N=51); 65% of cases (N=96) were acquired in our institution. Infections developed in 57 cases (38.8%), of which 36 (63.3%) were nosocomial. Contact isolation precautions were carried out for 79.6% of the cases, with a median duration of contact isolation precautions for 14 days (range: 0-144). The contact isolation precautions resulted in 2985 isolation days in total, i.e. 995 isolation days per year. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed clonal diversity in 94.2% of the isolates from patients. Seven patient-to-patient transmissions were noted. Only in 10 cases (6.8%) was colonization with ESBL-producing strains cleared. Considering the large number of immunocompromised patients treated in our institution (>1500 bone marrow or solid organ transplantations performed during 2002-2004), we will continue to isolate patients who are colonized or infected with ESBL-producing organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Emblica officinalis and Coriandrum sativum against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  - Present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of Emblica officinalis (amla) and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of Gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. Aqueous infusion and decoction of Emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (270), Klebsiella pneumoniae (51), K. ozaenae (3), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), Salmonella typhi (1), S. paratyphi A (2), S. paratyphi B (1) and Serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
TI  - [Incidence and clinical characteristics of symptomatic urinary infections in a geriatric hospital].
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND SETTINGS: The authors had for aim to study the incidence of symptomatic urinary infections (SUTI) in elderly patients, to describe their clinical and microbiologic characteristics and first-line treatment in a geriatric hospital with 902 beds: 124 in acute care (ACF), 293 in rehabilitation and intermediate-care (RICF), and 485 in long-term-care-facilities (LTCF). METHOD: During two months in 2003, all positive urine cultures detected by the laboratory were sent to the clinician with a questionnaire on clinical signs, diagnosis of SUTI and antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: SUTI was diagnosed in 85 out of 204 positive urine cultures (40%). The incidence of SUTI was 1.86 per 1,000 patient-days (with rates of 2.63, 2.49, 1.41 per 1,000 patients-days for the ACF, RICF, LTCF respectively). For 51 cases (60%) there were only general symptoms, for 24 cases (28.2%) there were only urinary symptoms, and for 10 cases (11.8%) there were both. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were the main bacterial species involved in 57 and 14% respectively. E. coli strains were 59% resistant to amoxicillin, 55% resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and 39% resistant to fluoroquinolones. The main antibiotics were fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, and amoxicillin-clavulanate, prescribed respectively in 52.5, 19, and 9% of the cases. CONCLUSION: SUTI was diagnosed in only in 40% of positive urine cultures from elderly patients hospitalized in our hospital. To improve the management of SUTI in this population, we changed our recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.
TI  - Interspecies spread of CTX-M-32 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and the role of  the insertion sequence IS1 in down-regulating bla CTX-M gene expression.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) as well as their genetic environment in different isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from a patient with repeated urinary tract infections. METHODS: Two isolates of Escherichia coli and one Proteus mirabilis, all with ESBL phenotypes, were studied. Conjugation experiments and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were performed. Cloning of the bla genes was by plasmid restriction and fragments ligation. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was by Etest. The genetic environment was analysed by direct sequencing of the DNA surrounding the bla gene. RT-PCR was performed to study the differences in the bla(CTX-M) gene expression. RESULTS: The bla gene was transferred by conjugation from the three clinical isolates, which by RFLP showed the same plasmid. The bla gene and surrounding sequences were cloned, an approximately 9 kbp AccI fragment was sequenced and the bla(CTX-M-32) gene was identified. The MICs of ceftazidime for transconjugants and transformants bearing the bla(CTX-M-32) gene were lower than those previously reported. Analysis of the DNA surrounding the ESBL gene revealed a new genetic structure with two insertion sequences, IS5 and IS1, located immediately upstream of the bla(CTX-M-32) gene; IS1 was located between the bla gene and IS5, and within the -10 and -35 promoter boxes of the bla(CTX-M-32) gene. Microbiological and biochemical studies revealed lower bla(CTX-M-32) gene expression in bacterial isolates with IS1 between the promoter boxes. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest putative in vivo horizontal bla(CTX-M-32) gene transfer between two different genera of Enterobacteriaceae. A new complex structure, IS5-IS1, was detected upstream of the bla gene and IS1 negatively modulated expression of the bla(CTX-M-32) gene because its location modified the bla promoter region.
TI  - Epidemiology and bacterial colonization of burn injuries in Blantyre.
AB  - Forty-nine patients from the Burns Unit at the QECH had swabs taken from various  sites in order to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibilities in burn wounds colonized by bacteria. The mean age was 16 years (range 1-70 years); 27 (55 %) of the study population were female and 22 (45%) were male. Twenty-four (49%) patients were epileptic. Open fire (41%) was the most common cause of burn injuries among epileptics while hot water burns (29%) were commonest among non-epileptics. Burn injury and percentage total burn surface area (% TBSA) injuries decreased with age, and the upper and lower limbs, trunk, head and neck were the most commonly affected sites. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate (23%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (22.7%), Streptococci spp (15.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and 3.4% for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Klebsiella spp. There was a significant trend of bacterial growth with increasing % TBSA (p<0.001). Bacterial growth was significantly more common in more recent burns of less than 20 days compared to burns of longer duration (OR 4.1 [95% CI 1.58-10.99]). Broad-spectrum antibiotics are required as first-line therapy for burns-related sepsis but there is need for surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility to help determine appropriate therapy.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase A2 enzymes.
AB  - AIMS: Venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified PLA(2)s and two L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). Several snake venoms (Daboia russelli russelli, Crotalus adamanteus, Naja sumatrana, Pseudechis guttata, Agkistrodon halys, Acanthophis praelongus and Daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. Daboia russelli russelli and Pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. The order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -S. aureus > Proteus mirabilis > Proteus vulgaris > Enterobacter aerogenes > Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against S. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). A stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). The MIC were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that viperidae (D. russelli russelli) and elapidae (P. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the PLA(2) enzymes. The results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The activity of LAAO and PLA(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.
TI  - Identification and quantitation of usnic acid from the lichen Usnea species of Anatolia and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Six species of lichens, such as Usnea florida, Usnea barbata, Usnea longissima, Usnea rigida, Usnea hirta and Usnea subflorida, were collected from different areas of Anatolia (district of Antalya, Karabuk, Qankiri, Giresun and Trabzon) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts in acetone extracts were determined by HPLC. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. It was shown that with increasing amount of usnic acid, the antimicrobial activity increased. Usnic acid contents of Usnea species varied between 0.22-6.49% of dry weight.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  - Three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), the VITEK 2 System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the MicroScan WalkAway-96 System (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA), using routine testing panels. One hundred fifty putative ESBL producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. Conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the CLSI double-disk synergy test, and the Etest ESBL were also evaluated. Biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. One hundred forty-seven isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii were investigated. Of these isolates, 85 were identified as ESBL producers by the reference method. The remaining isolates were identified as non-ESBL producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal AmpC, Koxy, or SHV enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. The system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of ESBLs was the Phoenix (99%), followed by the VITEK 2 (86%) and the MicroScan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (Phoenix) to 78% (VITEK 2). The performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. The sensitivities of the conventional test methods ranged from 93 to 94%. The double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.
TI  - [Community-acquired urinary tract infections in 15 to 65 years old female patients in France. Susceptibility of E. coli according to history: AFORCOPI-BIO network 2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A multicenter study was implemented in order to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of strains isolated from 15 to 65 year old female patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October to December 2003, 11 French private laboratories consecutively collected 420 clinical strains with medical data. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on E. coli were determined using the agar dilution method in a coordinating center and interpretation followed the recommendations of the Comite de l'antibiogramme de la Societe francaise de microbiologie. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (80%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (4%), Klebsiella spp (2%), other Enterobacteriaceae (4%), Enterococcus spp (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2%), and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). The susceptibility of E. coli strains was 61% for amoxicillin (AMX), 93% for nalidixic acid (NAL), 97% for norfloxacin (NOR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), 77% for cotrimoxazole (SXT), 99% for fosfomycin, gentamicin and cefotaxime. The susceptibility of E. coli was lower in case of previous treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics for AMX (84 vs 95% p=0.02) and SXT (62 vs 81% p=0.02). In the same way, previous treatment with quinolones was associated with decreased susceptibility for NAL (84 vs 95% p=0.02) and SXT (62 vs 81% p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In 2003, fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin kept a good activity on E. coli collected from community-acquired urinary tract infections in 15 to 65 years old female patients in France.
TI  - Emerging bacterial pathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates harbouring the same transferable plasmid coding for metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-1 in Greece.
AB  
TI  - The xaxAB genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. A peptide cytotoxin has been purified from X. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red blood cells of this toxin have been described (Ribeiro, C., Vignes, M., and Brehelin, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 3030-3039). We show here that this toxin, Xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (Xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. We also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxAB, encoding this toxin in X. nematophila. The expression of both genes in recombinant Escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. However, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. Furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxAB genes in X. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called C1. We also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, in Pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. This toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. It is, therefore, probably the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.
TI  - Comparison of three techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. METHODS: Twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. Three types of samples were taken from each dog. Urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. The samples were then cultured on blood agar and MacConkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). The most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were Escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). In the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. However, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. The uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. All the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.
TI  - Accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria. A modified double-disc test (MDDT) is incorporated in a Gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. The MDDT identified accurately ESBLs in all isolates subsequently confirmed as ESBL-producers by the standard Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) combined disc method. Of 1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for ESBLs by MDDT and 95 (7.8%) were positive by the CLSI method. ESBLs were detected in 48 (7.8%) E. coli, 21 (8%) K. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) Proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) Providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) Enterobacter cloacae isolates. Time required for ESBL detection by the MDDT method was one day. The protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of ESBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of Anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  - Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Syn A. chinensis (Lamk) A. Rich (Rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western Ghats for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobial potential of A. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that A. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that A. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic indices of efficacy for 5 fluoroquinolones toward pathogens of dogs and cats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are often used interchangeably in dogs and cats. HYPOTHESIS: Predicted therapeutic efficacy differs among fluoroquinolones. ANIMALS: Bacterial pathogens isolated from dogs and cats. METHODS: Using microtube-dilution procedures, percent resistance and 2 pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic indices (maximum concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration [Cmax/MIC] [target 0.10] and area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration [AUC/MIC] [target 0.125]) were compared prospectively at low and high doses (mg/kg) for ciprofloxacin (5 and 20), difloxacin (5 and 10), enrofloxacin (including enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin) (5 and 20), marbofloxacin (2.5 and 5), and orbifloxacin (2.5 and 7.5). Indices were calculated for organisms represented by < or = 15 isolates. RESULTS: Percent resistance for all Gram-negative (n = 180; 20+/-3%; 39+/-5% for Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive isolates (n = 66; 18+/-3%) did not differ among drugs or organisms. The pattern of Cmax/MIC was generally enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = orbifloxacin > or = difloxacin; and for AUIC/ MIC, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin > difloxacin > orbifloxacin. Among susceptible Gram-negative isolates studied (n = 117), targeted Cmax/MIC or AUC/MIC were achieved in 88% of E. coli, 53% of Proteus mirabilis, and 35% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and for susceptible Gram-positive isolates studied (n = 49), 53% of Streptotoccus spp. and Staphylococcus intermedius and 27% of Staphylococcus spp. At the high dose, the proportion of isolates for which a target was reached was: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin+ciprofloaxin, and marbofloxacin (77%), enrofloxacin (73%), orbifloxacin (51%), and difloxacin (40%); and at the low dose, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin (43%), ciprofloxacin (40%), marbofloxacin (39%), orbifloxacin (29%), and difloxacin (28%). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones approximated 40%. For susceptible isolates, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin more consistently reached indices associated with predicted efficacy, but only at the high dose.
TI  - Increased resistance to first-line agents among bacterial pathogens isolated from urinary tract infections in Latin America: time for local guidelines?
AB  - Emerging resistance phenotypes and antimicrobial resistance rates among pathogens recovered from community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTI) is an increasing problem in specific regions, limiting therapeutic options. As part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, a total of 611 isolates were collected in 2003 from patients with CA-UTI presenting at Latin American medical centers. Each strain was tested in a central laboratory using Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methods with appropriate controls. Escherichia coli was the leading pathogen (66%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (7%), Proteus mirabilis (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6%). Surprisingly high resistance rates were recorded for E. coli against first-line orally administered agents for CA-UTI, such as ampicillin (53.6%), TMP/SMX (40.4%), ciprofloxacin (21.6%), and gatifloxacin (17.1%). Decreased susceptibility rates to TMP/SMX and ciprofloxacin were also documented for Klebsiella spp. (79.1 and 81.4%, respectively), and P. mirabilis (71.8 and 84.6%, respectively). For Enterococcus spp., susceptibility rates to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin were 88.2, 85.3, 55.9, and 97.1%, respectively. High-level resistance to gentamicin was detected in 24% of Enterococcus spp. Bacteria isolated from patients with CA-UTI in Latin America showed limited susceptibility to orally administered antimicrobials, especially for TMP/SMX and fluoroquinolones. Our results highlight the need for developing specific CA-UTI guidelines in geographic regions where elevated resistance to new and old compounds may influence prescribing decisions.
TI  - In-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. Triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli C1214, Proteus mirabilis 296, Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Klebsiella pneumoniae 280, Staphylococcus aureus Newman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. Generic stents were utilized as controls. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. Lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated E. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein X and p-fimbriae. Triclosan stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. This drug-eluting stent provides both mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens that cause community-acquired urinary tract infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract pathogens obtained from patients in Madagascar are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics that are readily available at a low price. This poses a real problem for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: To obtain data on the pathogens responsible for community-acquired UTIs in Antananarivo and on their susceptibility patterns to the antimicrobial agents that are currently used to treat UTIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on bacteria isolated from the urine of patients at the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar between January 2004 and April 2006. RESULTS: We isolated 903 pathogens from 673 women and 213 men. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (607 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (87 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (35 strains) and Proteus mirabilis (32 strains). Seventy-seven per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 65.7% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and more than 15% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Strains were rarely resistant to more expensive antibiotics (ceftriaxone 5.9%, fosfomycin 4.6%). Most bacteria showed intermediate susceptibility to nitroxolin. Resistance rates of E. coli to ceftriaxone and gentamicin increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, due to the increase in strains harbouring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcaceae and Staphylococcus spp. were rarely resistant, but 9.5% of streptococci were resistant to penicillin A and 8% of staphylococci were resistant to oxacillin. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of amoxicillin- and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant Enterobacteriaceae implies that another antibiotic should be used for empirical treatment and that there is a need for new generic drugs in developing countries, especially in Madagascar.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - A microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  - A major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. In addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. A microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrB as the marker gene, was developed. We present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. Our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. The approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. The introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. Environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. Detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.
TI  - Are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. In this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. Every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. Cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. These rates were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. RESULTS: A total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. Only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii group, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (P < or = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. Previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.
TI  - Altered postnatal lung development in C3H/HeJ mice.
AB  - C3H/HeJ mice develop an increase in terminal air space area detectable by postnatal d 14 that persists into adulthood compared with strain-matched controls (C3H/SnJ, C3H/OuJ). Morphometric quantification revealed a 50% increase in terminal air space area by postnatal d 14 and a 2.3-fold increase by 2 mo of age in C3H/HeJ mice. Bacteriologic cultures obtained from the left lung on postnatal d 7 revealed > 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/left lung of predominantly Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) (Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis) in 13 of the 14 C3H/HeJ mice compared with 0 of 12 controls demonstrating colonization of the developing lung in C3H/HeJ mice. An approximately threefold increase in macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage, threefold increases in matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) mRNA and protein levels and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC) were also found. P. mirabilis obtained from lung cultures in C3H/HeJ mice induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells transfected with TLR5. In C3H/HeJ mice lacking TLR4 signaling, bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation and permanent changes in lung morphology.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II)] is described. The nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. In all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-O and endocyclic-N of the beta-lactam ring. The new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (a), Klebsiella pneumonae (b), Proteus mirabilis (c), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), Salmonella typhi (e), Shigella dysentriae (f), Bacillus cereus (g), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), Staphylococcus aureus (j) and Streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. All compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - There is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) presenting with symptoms of UTI have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their PBS/IC symptoms. One hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed IC were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. At the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (Bard 14Fr female) and cultured for bacteria. Eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. Once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of PBS/IC was confirmed. A pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (PUF) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. After the diagnosis of PBS/IC, all patients received multimodal treatment. Patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of UTI, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. Greater than 10(3) colonies were considered positive. Patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. Seventy-two patients (68%) had no UTI episodes or flares. The remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54 flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. A single flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). Recurrent UTI symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. Of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). Therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). Nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (n = 6), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and Citrobacter sp. (n = 1). One grew Streptococcus sp. There was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or PUF scores between groups. This study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed UTIs in a large group of PBS/IC patients followed longitudinally. These data suggest that only a small number of PBS/IC patients with UTI symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). Although the symptoms of recurrent UTI are prevalent in IC patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent UTIs is only 6.6%. Because the flares of IC are usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. These data suggest that the symptom flares of IC are not usually associated with recurrent UTI and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in IC patients who are culture-negative.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity of oral antibiotics against common urinary tract pathogens in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this investigation, the urine samples obtained in a single oral-dose pharmacokinetic study were examined for their bactericidal activity against a range of relevant urinary tract pathogens. METHODS: Six healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of ten oral antibiotics available in Croatia. Urine samples were taken every 2 h during the whole dosing interval of the particular antibiotic. The urinary bactericidal activity was tested by determination of urinary bactericidal titers. RESULTS: All antibiotics showed a significant urinary bactericidal activity against non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Fluoroquinolones displayed high and persisting levels of urinary bactericidal activity against all gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: Average urinary bactericidal activity can be predicted from in vitro susceptibility testing, but we expect that there will be patients with a low level of urinary bactericidal activity.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Mode of transposition and expression of 16S rRNA methyltransferase gene rmtC accompanied by ISEcp1.
AB  - A newly identified 16S rRNA methyltransferase gene, rmtC, was accompanied by an ISEcp1 element at its 5' end. This ISEcp1 element, which contained a transposase gene, tnpA, provided a promoter activity for expression of the adjacent rmtC; and this structure enabled the rmtC gene to be transposed onto another plasmid in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Effective prevention of microbial biofilm formation on medical devices by low-energy surface acoustic waves.
AB  - Low-energy surface acoustic waves generated from electrically activated piezo elements are shown to effectively prevent microbial biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. The development of biofilms by four different bacteria and Candida species is prevented when such elastic waves with amplitudes in the nanometer range are applied. Acoustic-wave-activated Foley catheters have all their surfaces vibrating with longitudinal and transversal dispersion vectors homogeneously surrounding the catheter surfaces. The acoustic waves at the surface are repulsive to bacteria and interfere with the docking and attachment of planktonic microorganisms to solid surfaces that constitute the initial phases of microbial biofilm development. FimH-mediated adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to guinea pig erythrocytes was prevented at power densities below thresholds that activate bacterial force sensor mechanisms. Elevated power densities dramatically enhanced red blood cell aggregation. We inserted Foley urinary catheters attached with elastic-wave-generating actuators into the urinary tracts of male rabbits. The treatment with the elastic acoustic waves maintained urine sterility for up to 9 days compared to 2 days in control catheterized animals. Scanning electron microscopy and bioburden analyses revealed diminished biofilm development on these catheters. The ability to prevent biofilm formation on indwelling devices and catheters can benefit the implanted medical device industry.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Taiwan: epidemiology, detection, treatment and infection control.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. ESBLs are most often plasmid-mediated. In Taiwan, the prevalence of ESBLs in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in Escherichia coli isolates. The most prevalent types of ESBLs are SHV-5, SHV-12, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-14 in isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli, with differences between institutions. SHV-12 and CTX-M-3 have been reported as the most common ESBLs in isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. Molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the ESBL-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. The current ESBL screen guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) are issued for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of ESBL in an isolate co-harboring an AmpC beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. Empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of ESBLs in an institution with a high prevalence of ESBL producers. Carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. To retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.
TI  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (FEBLA), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (LF) from non-lactose fermenters (NLF) in comparison with MacConkeys agar. Performance of FEBLA was at par with the latter. On FEBLA medium, the contrast between LF and NLF colonies was pronounced and Klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on MacConkeys agar (Hi Media). Unlike MacConkeys agar, a 24 h culture of K. pneumoniae cells on FEBLA were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. Escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. No change in cell morphology was evident with regard to Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter koseri and Acinetobacter baumannii. Performance of the medium was controlled using E. coli and S. flexneri. FEBLA is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. Of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. The strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC) and VCM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or = 4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, CZOP, meropenem (MEPM), and carumonam (CRMN) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. Against Serratia marcescens, imipenem (IPM) and gentamicin (GM) had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. MEPM prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/mL. Next, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZOP, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/mL except IPM and MEPM having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activities of CZOP and CAZ were considered to be relatively good on MIC50 comparison (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - New trends in prosthesis infection in cardiovascular surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult cardiovascular surgery entails, in many cases, the use of some  kind of prosthesis. Among the potential complications, prosthetic device infection is one of the most devastating in incidence, as well as in prognosis and damage to surrounding tissues. RESULTS: The most common bacterial agents in vascular and cardiac prosthetic device infections are Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis among gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The alternative modalities of treatment for prosthetic device infection encompass partial or total explantation of the prosthesis and its replacement with an infection-resistant graft (e.g., homologous tissue, autologous tissue, or synthetic prosthesis bonded with antibiotics).
TI  - [Epidemiology and etiology of urinary tract infections in the community. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the main pathogens and clinical significance of resistance].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a frequent problem in primary care. They occur mainly in women without underlying diseases and with no functional or structural anomalies of the urinary tract; consequently most cases are considered uncomplicated UTI. Etiology is influenced by factors such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, urinary catheterization, and other factors. Escherichia coli causes 80-85% of acute episodes of uncomplicated cystitis. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella spp. are responsible for most of the remaining episodes. The spectrum of bacteria that causes complicated UTI is much broader. Rates of resistance have undergone considerable variations, and consequently the empirical treatment of UTI requires constant updating of the antibiotic sensitivity of the main uropathogens of the area, country or institution. To correctly interpret the global data on sensitivity, the type of UTI (uncomplicated versus complicated), sex, age and previous antibiotic therapy in each patient must be taken into account. Resistance in uncomplicated UTI has clinical significance (although less than in systemic infections such as bacteremia), which depends on whether the infection is cystitis or pyelonephritis.
TI  - Urinary tract infection caused by fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - In 2001, fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli isolates emerged in Japan in  patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), and accounted for ca. 8% of isolates. This is a worldwide occurrence as reported by the ECO.SENS study. The number of fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with complicated UTI is increasing. Most cephem-resistant isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The rates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae differ between countries but there are ESBL producers in urinary Enterobacteriaceae isolates in most countries. More seriously, most nosocomial ESBL producers are also resistant to non-beta-lactams, such as the fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin and co-trimoxazole. This causes serious problems in the chemotherapy of cystitis.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) are treated with beta-lactams, co-trimoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin tromethamine. Due to increasing resistance of causative pathogens, antibiotics should be used by considering their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics. beta-lactams have time-dependent activity and should not be used once-daily. Co-trimoxazole should be restricted due to increasing chemoresistance. Fluoroquinolones play a primary role in the treatment of serious and complicated infections. Fosfomycin tromethamine is active against most urinary tract pathogens. In vitro time-kill kinetics of fosfomycin against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis showed primarily concentration-dependent activity, with a prolonged post-antibiotic effect (3.4 to 4.7h). Based on these results a single 3g dose of fosfomycin guarantees optimal efficacy against common uropathogens with an AUC(urine)/MIC ratio of 500.
TI  - In vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from Intensive Care Units in Taiwan: SMART 2004 programme data.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against Gram-negative bacterial isolates from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from ICUs of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. Sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam concentration of 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. Piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam had better activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/L (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/L for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/L for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). For Acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. Adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant P. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and A. baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam) isolates. Results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam are dependent on the method used. Piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteria from patients seeking medical advice in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe.
AB  - Microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advice in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe of December 2004 were analysed at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common findings from wound cultures. Common human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. More rare species of Gram-negative bacilli, e.g. Myroides odoratus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bergeyella zoohelcum were also isolated. Resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was more extensive compared to our Swedish reference material for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter spp., but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, probably reflecting that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in Asia.
TI  - A simple phenotypic method for differentiation between acquired and chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening methods for the detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are technically demanding. The purpose of this study was to assess screening methods for the detection of these enzymes in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: Isolates were selected according to a resistance phenotype consistent with production of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Detection of acquired ampC genes was done with a multiplex ampC-PCR and sequencing. The phenotypic detection methods evaluated included visual examination of antibiogram plates to identify the presence of scattered colonies located near the edge of the inhibition halo of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and a double-disc synergy test using cloxacillin (500 mg) to inhibit AmpC enzymes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven isolates were selected from among 6,209 isolates recovered. Acquired ampC genes (blaCMY-2, blaDHA-1, blaCMY-4 and blaACC-1) were found in 19 (24.7%) of these isolates, including 14 E. coli, two K. pneumoniae and three P. mirabilis isolates. The differential trait for the presence of colonies in the inhibition halo was 100% sensitive and specific. Similar results were obtained for the cloxacillin test, except for the E. coli isolates in which specificity was 10.3%. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic trait described here can be considered useful for suspecting the presence of these enzymes. The cloxacillin test was only useful in isolates lacking a natural AmpC beta-lactamase.
TI  - Effectiveness of flouroquinolone therapy for gram-negative infections within the  intensive care unit setting.
AB  
TI  - Using interrupted time series analysis to assess associations of fluoroquinolone  formulary changes with susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens and isolation rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. Changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. Interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation rate. Susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the MRSA isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. Levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. Statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P, 0.042) and Escherichia coli (P, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising MRSA isolation rate (P, 0.001) were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. Substitution of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in E. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in MRSA isolation rate. No associations were detected on susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. These findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of MRSA may vary by both drug and organism.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ZnII, CdII, and HgII complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - Performance in detection and reporting beta-lactam resistance phenotypes in Enterobacteriaceae: a nationwide proficiency study in Italian laboratories.
AB  - We evaluated the ability of 60 Italian clinical microbiology laboratories in detecting and reporting beta-lactam resistance phenotypes in Enterobacteriaceae. Laboratories received 5 well-characterized isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), 2 hyperproducers of chromosomal enzymes, and 3 quality control strains. The performances in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) were different depending on the species and type of ESBL produced. High rates of very major errors (up to 56%) were observed for ESBL producers when testing cephalosporins and aztreonam, especially in the case of CTX-M-1-producing Escherichia coli and TEM-52-producing Proteus mirabilis. Isolates hyperproducing chromosomal enzymes were erroneously reported as ESBL producers in approximately 20% of cases. Detection of ESBLs is still a problem for clinical microbiology laboratories. Overall, performances in AST appear to be better with Klebsiella spp. producing well-known enzymes (e.g., SHV type) than with strains producing emerging enzymes (e.g., CTX-M type) or organisms not well recognized as ESBL producers (e.g., P. mirabilis).
TI  - Trends in production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteria of medical interest: report of the second Italian nationwide survey.
AB  - Results of a 2003 survey carried out in Italy to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteria are presented. Eleven Italian Microbiology Laboratories investigated 9,076 consecutive nonreplicate isolates (inpatients, 6,850; outpatients, 2,226). ESBL screening was performed by MIC data analysis. Confirmation was obtained using the double-disk synergy test and the combination disk test based on CLSI methodology. ESBL determinants were investigated by colony blot hybridization and confirmed by sequencing. Results were compared to those of the 1999 Italian survey (8,015 isolates). The prevalence of ESBL producers was 7.4% among isolates from inpatients (in 1999, 6.3%) and 3.5% among outpatients (no data were available for 1999). Among hospitalized patients, the most prevalent ESBL-positive species was Escherichia coli (Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1999). Proteus mirabilis was the most prevalent ESBL-positive species among outpatients. In both groups, most ESBL-positive pathogens were obtained from urinary tract infections. TEM-type ESBLs were the most prevalent enzymes (45.4%). Non-TEM, non-SHV determinants emerged: CTX-M-type in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and PER-type in P. mirabilis, Providencia spp., and E. coli. With the exception of 3/163 P. mirabilis isolates and 1/44 Providencia stuartii isolate (all of which were intermediate for imipenem), carbapenems were active against all ESBL-positive enterobacteria. Susceptibility to other drugs was as follows: 84.7% for amikacin, 84.4% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 48.0% for gentamicin, and 32.8% for ciprofloxacin. Carbapenems appear to be the drug of choice. Amikacin and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations represent an alternative in non-life-threatening infections. The appearance of ESBL-positive enterobacteria in the community makes it mandatory that family physicians learn how to treat these pathogens.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - Lipid-specific membrane activity of human beta-defensin-3.
AB  - Defensins represent a major component of innate host defense against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses. One potent defensin found, e.g., in epithelia, is the polycationic human beta-defensin-3 (hBD3). We investigated the role of the lipid matrix composition, and in particular the presence of negatively charged lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from sensitive (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota) or resistant (Proteus mirabilis) Gram-negative bacteria or of the zwitterionic phospholipids of human cells, in determining the action of polycationic hBD3 on the different membranes, and related to their biological activity. The main focus was directed on data derived from electrical measurements on a reconstitution system of the OM as a planar asymmetric bilayer composed on one side of LPS and on the other of a phospholipid mixture. Our results demonstrate that the antimicrobial activity and the absence of cytotoxicity can be explained by the lipid-specificity of the peptide. A clear correlation between these aspects of the biological activity of hBD3 and its interaction with lipid matrices could be found. In particular, hBD3 could only induce lesions in those membranes resembling the lipid composition of the OM of sensitive bacterial strains. The permeation through the membrane is a decisive first step for the biological activity of many antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, we propose that the lipid-specificity of hBD3 as well as some other membrane-active antimicrobial peptides is important for their activity against bacteria or mammalian cells.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Determination of usnic acid in some Rhizoplaca species from Middle Anatolia and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Three species of lichens, Rhizoplaca chrysoleuca (Sm.) Zopf, Rhizoplaca melanopthalma (DC.) Leuckert & Poelt and Rhizoplaca peltata Ramonds Leuckert, were collected from middle Anatolia, Erciyes Mountain (Kayseri) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts were determined by HPLC in acetone extracts. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was shown that, as the usnic acid amount increased, the antimicrobial activities increased too. The usnic acid contents of Rhizoplaca species varied between 0.19-4.0% dry weight.
TI  - Cold adapted features of Vibrio salmonicida catalase: characterisation and comparison to the mesophilic counterpart from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The gene encoding catalase from the psychrophilic marine bacterium Vibrio salmonicida LFI1238 was identified, cloned and expressed in the catalase-deficient Escherichia coli UM2. Recombinant catalase from V. salmonicida (VSC) was purified to apparent homogeneity as a tetramer with a molecular mass of 235 kDa. VSC contained 67% heme b and 25% protoporphyrin IX. VSC was able to bind NADPH, react with cyanide and form compounds I and II as other monofunctional small subunit heme catalases. Amino acid sequence alignment of VSC and catalase from the mesophilic Proteus mirabilis (PMC) revealed 71% identity. As for cold adapted enzymes in general, VSC possessed a lower temperature optimum and higher catalytic efficiency (k (cat)/K (m)) compared to PMC. VSC have higher affinity for hydrogen peroxide (apparent K (m)) at all temperatures. For VSC the turnover rate (k (cat)) is slightly lower while the catalytic efficiency is slightly higher compared to PMC over the temperature range measured, except at 4 degrees C. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency of VSC and PMC is almost temperature independent, except at 4 degrees C where PMC has a twofold lower efficiency compared to VSC. This may indicate that VSC has evolved to maintain a high efficiency at low temperatures.

TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  - The study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the Outpatient Service of the Transplantation Institute in Warsaw. The patients enrolled into the study had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. In the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures. Cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). Eventually, urinary tract infection (UTI) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic UTI and 22 cases of asymptomatic UTI) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. In cases where urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: Escherichia coli: 22 strains, Enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, Enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of Ralstonia picketii, Streptococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Over 90% of Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. The only drug of similar efficacy, which could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Urinary tract infections in general practice patients: diagnostic tests versus bacteriological culture.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections encountered in general practice. For the optimal treatment the general practitioner (GP) should rely on the results of diagnostic tests and recent antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total 1993 female patients (11-70 years) with complaints of an acute uncomplicated UTI were included. The performance characteristics of the diagnostic tests used were determined and compared with the antibiotic prescription rate. The antibiotic therapy (agent and duration), the uropathogens and the antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli were determined for each age group. RESULTS: The positive predictive value (PPV) (96%) and the specificity (94%) of the nitrite test were high for all samples. A negative nitrite with a positive leucocyte-esterase (LE) test showed a high PPV (79%) and sensitivity (82%). When both nitrite and LE tests were negative approximately 50% of the samples were culture positive. Of the patients, 94% of those with a positive nitrite test and 71% of those with a negative nitrite and positive LE test were prescribed antibiotics, mostly nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim. Nitrofurantoin prescriptions decreased and those of fluoroquinolones increased with increasing age. Nitrofurantoin was equally prescribed for 3-7 days in all patients. Trimethoprim was mostly prescribed for 3 days in patients aged 21-50 years and for 5 days in the other patients. E. coli, the uropathogen mostly isolated, decreased in frequency with increasing age. Proteus mirabilis was found more in the oldest patients and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in the younger patients. The antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli was not age related. The lowest percentages were found for amoxicillin (67%) and trimethoprim (77%). Fluoroquinolone resistance was emerging in the older patients. CONCLUSIONS: For female patients with symptoms of an acute uncomplicated UTI a positive nitrite test or a negative nitrite test with a positive LE test confirmed UTI whereas a negative nitrite together with a negative LE test did not rule out infection. For empirical treatment GPs should take into account the changing aetiology with increasing age. Prudent use of antibiotics in general and more specifically fluoroquinolones remains recommended. As trimethoprim resistance reached 20% it might be advisable to no longer use it as therapy of first choice for acute uncomplicated UTIs in The Netherlands.
TI  - Bioactive components of the traditionally used mushroom Podaxis pistillaris.
AB  - In the course of an ethnobotanical study on fungi used in Yemeni ethnomedicine the fungus Podaxis pistillaris (Podaxales, Podaxaceae, Basidiomycetes) was found to exhibit antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus flavus, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. In the culture medium of P. pistillaris three epidithiodiketopiperazines were identified by activity-guided isolation. Based on spectral data (NMR, ESI-MS and DCI-MS) their identity was established as epicorazine A (1), epicorazine B (2) and epicorazine C (3, antibiotic F 3822), which have not been reported as constituents of P. pistillaris previously. It is assumed that the identified compounds contribute to the antibacterial activity of the extract.
TI  - Global assessment of the antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B against 54 731 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme (2001-2004).
AB  - In total, 54 731 Gram-negative bacilli isolated worldwide between 2001 and 2004 from diverse sites of infection were tested for susceptibility to polymyxin B by the broth reference microdilution method, with interpretation of results according to CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. Polymyxin B showed excellent potency and spectrum against 8705 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2621 Acinetobacter spp. isolates (MIC50, < or = 1 mg/L and MIC90, 2 mg/L for both pathogens). Polymyxin B resistance rates were slightly higher for carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (2.7%) and Acinetobacter spp. (2.8%), or multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa (3.3%) and Acinetobacter spp. (3.2%), when compared with the entire group (1.3% for P. aeruginosa and 2.1% for Acinetobacter spp.). Among P. aeruginosa, polymyxin B resistance rates varied from 2.9% in the Asia-Pacific region to only 1.1% in Europe, Latin America and North America, while polymyxin B resistance rates ranged from 2.7% in Europe to 1.7% in North America and Latin America among Acinetobacter spp. Polymyxin B also demonstrated excellent activity (MIC90, < or = 1 mg/L; > 98% susceptible) against Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., but activity was more variable against Enterobacter spp. (MIC50, < or = 1 mg/L; 83.3% susceptible) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC50, < or = 1 mg/L; 72.4% susceptible), and was very limited (MIC50, > 8 mg/L) against Burkholderia cepacia (11.8% susceptible), Serratia spp. (5.4% susceptible), indole-positive Proteus spp. (1.3% susceptible) and Proteus mirabilis (0.7% susceptible).
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of a cold-adapted catalase from Vibrio salmonicida.
AB  - Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and  molecular oxygen. Recombinant Vibrio salmonicida catalase (VSC) possesses typical cold-adapted features, with higher catalytic efficiency, lower thermal stability and a lower temperature optimum than its mesophilic counterpart from Proteus mirabilis. Crystals of VSC were produced by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using ammonium sulfate as precipitant. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 98.15, b = 217.76, c = 99.28 A, beta = 110.48 degrees. Data were collected to 1.96 A and a molecular-replacement solution was found with eight molecules in the asymmetric unit.
TI  - Crystallization of truncated hemolysin A from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Proteus species are second only to Escherichia coli as the most common causative  agent of Gram-negative bacteria-based urinary-tract infections and many harbor several virulence factors that provide inherent uropathogenicity. One virulence factor stems from a two-partner secretion pathway comprised of hemolysin A and hemolysin B; upon hemolysin B-dependent secretion, hemolysin A becomes activated. This system is distinct from the classic type I secretion pathway exemplified by the hemolysin system within Escherichia coli. In order to describe the mechanism by which hemolysin A is activated for pore formation, an amino-terminal truncated form capable of complementing the non-secreted full-length hemolysin A and thereby restoring hemolytic activity has been constructed, expressed and purified. A room-temperature data set has been collected to 2.5 A resolution. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 34.47, b = 58.40, c = 119.74 A. The asymmetric unit is expected to contain a single monomer, which equates to a Matthews coefficient of 1.72 A3 Da(-1) and a solvent content of 28.3%.
TI  - Antibiotic treatment and resistance of unselected uropathogens in the elderly.
AB  - A population-based study was conducted among women over the age of 70 years with  complaints of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). The positive predictive value of the nitrite test alone or in combination with the leukocyte esterase test ranged between 83% and 99%. The nitrofurantoin prescription rate decreased whereas fluoroquinolone and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid prescriptions increased with increasing age. The aetiology of infection was age-dependent. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated uropathogen, followed by Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. For these uropathogens, the lowest susceptibility percentages were found for amoxicillin, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. As trimethoprim susceptibility reached approximately 75%, it may be advisable not to use this as a first-choice agent in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in the elderly.
TI  - Clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli: report from the  Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Surveillance Program in the United States (2004).
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. Between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 US medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. Over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) reference methods. Analysis of the MIC results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive Proteae (-22.1%), Escherichia coli (-17.0%), Enterobacter species (-10.0%), and Proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. Antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. In 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 Escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. Other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among Enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), Providencia stuartii (5 strains), and Morganella morganii (4 strains). A significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. Continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. Possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.
TI  - Use of electrochemical DNA biosensors for rapid molecular identification of uropathogens in clinical urine specimens.
AB  - We describe the first species-specific detection of bacterial pathogens in human  clinical fluid samples using a microfabricated electrochemical sensor array. Each of the 16 sensors in the array consisted of three single-layer gold electrodes-working, reference, and auxiliary. Each of the working electrodes contained one representative from a library of capture probes, each specific for a clinically relevant bacterial urinary pathogen. The library included probes for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterocococcus spp., and the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group. A bacterial 16S rRNA target derived from single-step bacterial lysis was hybridized both to the biotin-modified capture probe on the sensor surface and to a second, fluorescein-modified detector probe. Detection of the target-probe hybrids was achieved through binding of a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody to the detector probe. Amperometric measurement of the catalyzed HRP reaction was obtained at a fixed potential of -200 mV between the working and reference electrodes. Species-specific detection of as few as 2,600 uropathogenic bacteria in culture, inoculated urine, and clinical urine samples was achieved within 45 min from the beginning of sample processing. In a feasibility study of this amperometric detection system using blinded clinical urine specimens, the sensor array had 100% sensitivity for direct detection of gram-negative bacteria without nucleic acid purification or amplification. Identification was demonstrated for 98% of gram-negative bacteria for which species-specific probes were available. When combined with a microfluidics-based sample preparation module, the integrated system could serve as a point-of-care device for rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - CMY-16, a novel acquired AmpC-type beta-lactamase of the CMY/LAT lineage in multifocal monophyletic isolates of Proteus mirabilis from northern Italy.
AB  - We report multifocal detection (four different cities in northern Italy) of Proteus mirabilis isolates resistant to both oxyimino- and 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins and producing a novel acquired AmpC-like beta-lactamase. The enzyme, named CMY-16, is a variant of the CMY/LAT lineage, which differs from the closest homologues, CMY-4 and CMY-12, by a single amino acid substitution (A171S or N363S, respectively) and from CMY-2 by two substitutions (A171S and W221R). Expression of the cloned bla(CMY-16) gene in Escherichia coli decreased susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. Tazobactam was more effective than clavulanate at antagonizing the enzyme activity. Genotyping, by random amplification of polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA digested with SfiI, showed that isolates were clonally related to each other, although not identical. The bla(CMY-16) gene was not transferable to E. coli by conjugation or transformation. In all isolates, it was chromosomally located and inserted in a conserved genetic environment. PCR mapping experiments revealed that the bla(CMY-16) was flanked by ISEcp1 and the blc gene, similar to other genes of this lineage from plasmids of Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella spp., and E. coli. Overall, these results revealed multifocal spreading of a CMY-16-producing P. mirabilis clone in northern Italy. This finding represents the first report of an acquired AmpC-like beta-lactamase in Proteus mirabilis from Italy and underscores the emergence of similar resistance determinants in the European setting.
TI  - Capillary activity of surgical sutures and suture-dependent bacterial transport:  a qualitative study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the multitude of new synthetic absorbable sutures (both monofilament and multifilament) in comparison with older materials with regard to capillarity and bacterial transport. METHODS: Sutures of United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) 4-0 thickness were arranged in a three-chamber system under sterile conditions. Either a colorant (liquid transport evaluation) or bacteria (bacterial transport evaluation) were added to the contamination chamber, and movement of colorant or bacteria was evaluated for as long as 30 days. RESULTS: None of the monofilament sutures transported colorant or bacteria. Colorant transport was found on the pseudomonofilament and multifilament sutures between the first and the fifth day. Escherichia coli were transported on the majority of the multifilament sutures, although no transport was found on silk or polyester sutures. Bacterial transport was most often evident in tests using the motile Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSIONS: All multifilament and pseudomonofilament suture designs allowed transport of colorants and bacteria to some degree. The movement of fluids and bacteria did not depend on the absorptive capacity of the sutures, coating, or the presence of an open suture end.
TI  - Rigid sigmoidoscopy: a potential hazard for cross-contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rigid sigmoidoscopy using a disposable or nondisposable sigmoidoscope is a common outpatient procedure. It has been assumed that the nondisposable bellows and light head of the sigmoidoscope remain free from enteric organisms so that the procedure is sterile if a disposable or nondisposable (metal) sigmoidoscope shaft is used. The aim of this study was to identify the presence of organisms within the bellows or light head of the sigmoidoscope. METHODS: Of 21 patients undergoing rigid sigmoidoscopy with a disposable instrument, bacterial cultures were taken from the inside of sterile Jackson-Pratt bulbs in 12 patients, with the bulbs being used to simulate the nondisposable insufflation bellows. In an additional nine patients, swabs were taken for culture from the inside of the nondisposable light head. RESULTS: Enteric gram-negative Escherichia coli and mixed anaerobic organisms were cultured from the Jackson-Pratt bulbs in two cases, and gram-positive organisms were cultured in another case. Gram-negative organisms, including Bacillus, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis, were cultured from the inside of the light head in two cases. CONCLUSION: Sigmoidoscopy using a disposable instrument is not a sterile procedure and may pose a risk of patient-to-patient cross-contamination by potentially harboring organisms in the bellows or light head.
TI  - [Rare bacteria species found in wounds of tsunami patients. Predominance of gram-negative rods, increased antibiotic resistance].
AB  - Microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advise in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe December 2004 were analysed at the Clinical microbiology laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gram-negative rods were the most common findings from wound cultures. Common human pathogens as Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. However, more rare species of gram-negative rods were also isolated, e.g. Myroides odoratus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bergeyella zoohelcum. Resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was higher compared to our Swedish reference material for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter spp, but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Possibly, this reflects that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in Asia.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel kit for the rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Since a method of rapidly detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in gram-negative isolates from patients with severe infection is urgently required, the present study of a novel commercial kit was conducted. The Cica-Beta Test I (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) is designed for the rapid detection of ESBL in gram-negative bacteria directly from isolated colonies in a 15-min protocol. In this study, a total of 304 strains of Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were tested using the novel kit and the phenotypic confirmatory disk test using cefotaxime and ceftazidime with and without clavulanate. The kit showed 95.5 and 98.1% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, as compared to the disk test, and thus proved to be an appropriate tool for the rapid detection of ESBL.
TI  - Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in general practice: clinical  and microbiological cure rates after three- versus five-day treatment with trimethoprim.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological studies indicate that acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in women can be successfully treated with short treatment regimens. However, the findings from the literature do not match experiences in daily practice. METHODS: A randomised, controlled trial evaluating the microbiological and clinical (self-reported) cure rates of a three-day vs. five-day treatment regimen with trimethoprim for UTI in women. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in bacteriological cure rate was found between the three-day and five-day regimen. One day after the shorter regimen 44% of women considered themselves as 'not-recovered' due to persistence of the symptoms compared with 35% after the five-day treatment (p > 0.05). Three days after therapy these percentages were 30 and 25% respectively. CONCLUSION: The relatively high percentage of persistent symptoms one day after the three-day regimen might be responsible for general practitioners believing that short regimens are not successful. It is therefore advisable that if urine samples are controlled to wait at least three days after finishing treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Novel plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylase, RmtC, found in a proteus mirabilis isolate demonstrating extraordinary high-level resistance against various aminoglycosides.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis ARS68, which demonstrated a very high level of resistance to various aminoglycosides, was isolated in 2003 from an inpatient in Japan. The aminoglycoside resistance of this strain could not be transferred to recipient strains Escherichia coli CSH-2 and E. coli HB101 by a general conjugation experiment, but E. coli DH5alpha was successfully transformed by electroporation with the plasmid of the parent strain, ARS68, and acquired an unusually high degree of resistance against aminoglycosides. Cloning and sequencing analyses revealed that the presence of a novel 16S rRNA methylase gene, designated rmtC, was responsible for resistance in strain ARS68 and its transformant. The G+C content of rmtC was 41.1%, and the deduced amino acid sequences of the newly identified 16S rRNA methylase, RmtC, shared a relatively low level of identity (< or = 29%) to other plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylases, RmtA, RmtB, and ArmA, which have also been identified in pathogenic gram-negative bacilli. Also, RmtC shared a low level of identity (< or = 28%) with the other 16S rRNA methylases found in aminoglycoside-producing actinomycetes. The purified histidine-tagged RmtC clearly showed methyltransferase activity against E. coli 16S rRNA in vitro. rmtC was located downstream of an ISEcp1-like element containing tnpA. Several plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylases have been identified in pathogenic gram-negative bacilli belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, and some of them are dispersing worldwide. The acceleration of aminoglycoside resistance among gram-negative bacilli by producing plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylases, such as RmtC, RmtB, and RmtA, may indeed become an actual clinical hazard in the near future.
TI  - Assessment of antibacterial activity of some topical otological solutions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Otological solutions have long been used in the treatment of the bacterial and fungal infections of the ear. We investigated antibacterial activity of some otic solutions against the most common bacteria isolated from discharging ears. STUDY DESIGN: Three solutions were used (Castellani's, Burrow's, and 2% salicyl alcohol) for 20 fresh isolates of each of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter spp.. The activity of each solution was determined by the size of the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth. RESULTS: The Castellani's solution showed significantly larger average inhibition zones than the other solutions did (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Castellani's solution may be considered a good option against bacterial or mixed infections (bacterial and fungal) of the ear.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. Several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. Patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. This question led us to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were used for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. Six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin HCl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. Drops were placed on Whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. After overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees C, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. There was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. The inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. Acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. Therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.
TI  - Case analysis of purple urine-bag syndrome at a long-term care service in a community hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Purple urine-bag syndrome (PUBS) is a rare phenomenon in which the contents of urine bags turn purple or blue following patient catheterization. The condition often causes care givers tremendous distress. We investigated the prevalence and possible causes of PUBS for a group of elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 157 patients featuring urine catheterization, 13 of whom exhibiting PUBS were analyzed with regards to age, functional status, duration of catheterization, number of daily medications, living location, feeding route, bowel habits, and the pattern of use of a urinary catheter. Urine samples were cultured from all the PUBS patients participating. RESULTS: Two men who underwent cystostomy and 11 women who underwent urethral catheterization who exhibited PUBS were observed for this study. The age, duration of catheterization, number of daily medications feeding pattern and functional status between the group exhibiting PUBS and the group of patients without PUBS demonstrated no significant differences. A total of 69.2% of the PUBS-affected patients, as compared to 43.1% of the non-PUBS patients, lived in nursing homes, and 84.6% of the PUBS-affected patients were constipated, as were 66% of the non-PUBD subjects. In total, 72.7% of PUBS patients were reported to be using a laxative suppository, compared with 41% of the non-PUBS group, whereas 92.3% of PUBS patients were catheterized using a plastic (PVC) foley, as compared to 70.8% of the non-PUBS patients. The pH for 12 out of 13 PUBS patients' urine was > or = 7. Escherichia coli, Provendicia var. spp., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae were the common pathogens isolated from the urine samples provided by our PUBS patients. CONCLUSION: We found that PUBS was more likely associated with the female gender, alkaline urine, constipation, institutionalization, the use of a plastic (PVC) urinary catheter, and certain bacteria such as Provendicia var. spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - DNA sequence analysis of the genetic environment of various blaCTX-M genes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Over a 3 year period (2000-2003) 21 Escherichia coli, 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Serratia marcescens and 1 Proteus mirabilis producing CTX-M-type beta-lactamase were collected from five different hospitals in Paris, France. This study was conducted to analyse the genetic environment of these 28 bla(CTX-M) genes. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion method and MICs of various beta-lactams were determined by an agar dilution method. PCR was used to detect and sequence alleles encoding CTX-M, TEM, SHV and CMY enzymes. The genetic environment was analysed by amplification and direct sequencing using various set of PCR primers or cloning in pBK-CMV. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed that these isolates contained seven different bla(CTX-M) genes: bla(CTX-M-1) (4 strains), bla(CTX-M-2) (2 strains), bla(CTX-M-3) (4 strains), bla(CTX-M-9) (1 strain), bla(CTX-M-14) (5 strains), bla(CTX-M-15) (11 strains), bla(CTX-M-24) (1 strain). TEM-1 was associated with CTX-M-type enzymes in 15 isolates. Two strains produced both CTX-M-15 and SHV-2 or CTX-M-14 and CMY-2. In 25 strains the insertion sequence ISEcp1 was located upstream of the 5' end of the bla(CTX-M) gene. Among these strains, in five isolates, ISEcp1 was disrupted by insertion sequences such as IS26 (in three of them) or IS1 or IS10. Insertion sequence IS903 was found downstream of bla(CTX-M-14) or bla(CTX-M-24). Examination of the other three bla(CTX-M) genes (two bla(CTX-M-2) and one bla(CTX-M-9)) by cloning, sequencing and PCR analysis revealed the presence of complex Class 1 integrons, In35, an integron similar to In60 and a novel integron. CONCLUSIONS: This work further confirmed the predominant role of ISEcp1 in the mobilization of bla(CTX-M) genes of the CTX-M-1 cluster and the presence of In35, of an integron similar to In60 and a novel complex Class 1 integron.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  - The physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. This prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. Semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and/or U. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) CCU ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. In standard aerobic cultures, Gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and Streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). Ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered, high (> or =10(4) CCU ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) CCU ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. Of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. This study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of U. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for U. urealyticum should be raised to > or =10(4) CFU ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before any treatment.
TI  - Surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples and faecal carriers in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to characterize and compare the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms isolated from clinical samples and faecal carriers in 2001 and 2002. METHODS: A total of 5251 Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical samples and 1321 stool samples were evaluated for the presence of ESBLs. The stool samples were spread onto plates of MacConkey agar containing 2 mg/L cefotaxime for selection of ESBL-producing strains. These strains were defined as those showing synergism between amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and third-generation cephalosporins. The beta-lactamases involved were characterized by isoelectric focusing, PCR assays and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains among clinical Enterobacteriaceae was 1.7%. Of these, 87.6% produced CTX-M, 25.8% produced SHV and 2.2% were TEM-type-producing strains. All clinical ESBL-producing strains were Escherichia coli, with the exception of four Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Citrobacter freundii. The prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing organisms was 3.3%. Of these, 75% produced CTX-M-type enzymes followed by 22.7% SHV-producing strains. All faecal ESBL-producing strains were E. coli except for one Enterobacter cloacae and one Proteus mirabilis. This latter strain produced the PER-1 enzyme reported for the first time in Spain. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains in stool samples was higher than that observed in clinical samples from the same period. The different types of ESBLs found were similar in both contexts. The most prevalent ESBLs were the CTX-M-related enzymes, with nine different types, followed by SHV-12.
TI  - [Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum secondary to a surgical treatment of Bartholin's gland abscess].
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum is a rare but of fast evolution, and potentially fatal infectious disease process. It is characterized by progressive inflammation and extensive necrosis of subcutaneous tissue involving the fascia and other adjacent tissues. This infection may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or pelvic surgery. Its mortality rate is 20%. We report a case of necrotzing fasciitis of the perineum in a 34-year-old woman following incision and drainage of Bartholin's gland abscess. Streptococcus A, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans were isolated. Intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was promptly instituted. Concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was required. Post debridement therapy required a long period of dressing changes until cicatrisation. Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis and prompt aggressive debridement are the keys to successful management.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - N,N-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  - The biogenous antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine (NCT) converts by disproportionation to N,N-dichlorotaurine (NDCT) at a rate proportional to acidity. This occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. To understand the consequences of NDCT formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. Differently from NCT, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. While the free acid, Cl(2)HNCH(2)CH(2)SO(3)H, was not available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees C (potassium) and 162-164 degrees C (sodium). The sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). The aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than NCT. With regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation), NDCT was, surprisingly, less efficacious than NCT, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at pH < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. Compared on a molar scale, NDCT was more bactericidal than NCT against the gram-negative bacteria E. coli, P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The increase of bactericidal activity at acidic pH was the same as observed with NCT and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. Taken together, NDCT seems not to be suited to substitute NCT as a preparation fit for medical practice.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - The ability of Proteus mirabilis to sense surfaces and regulate virulence gene expression involves FliL, a flagellar basal body protein.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a urinary tract pathogen that differentiates from a short swimmer cell to an elongated, highly flagellated swarmer cell. Swarmer cell differentiation parallels an increased expression of several virulence factors, suggesting that both processes are controlled by the same signal. The molecular nature of this signal is not known but is hypothesized to involve the inhibition of flagellar rotation. In this study, data are presented supporting the idea that conditions inhibiting flagellar rotation induce swarmer cell differentiation and implicating a rotating flagellar filament as critical to the sensing mechanism. Mutations in three genes, fliL, fliF, and fliG, encoding components of the flagellar basal body, result in the inappropriate development of swarmer cells in noninducing liquid media or hyperelongated swarmer cells on agar media. The fliL mutation was studied in detail. FliL- mutants are nonmotile and fail to synthesize flagellin, while complementation of fliL restores wild-type cell elongation but not motility. Overexpression of fliL+ in wild-type cells prevents swarmer cell differentiation and motility, a result also observed when P. mirabilis fliL+ was expressed in Escherichia coli. These results suggest that FliL plays a role in swarmer cell differentiation and implicate FliL as critical to transduction of the signal inducing swarmer cell differentiation and virulence gene expression. In concert with this idea, defects in fliL up-regulate the expression of two virulence genes, zapA and hpmB. These results support the hypothesis that P. mirabilis ascertains its location in the environment or host by assessing the status of its flagellar motors, which in turn control swarmer cell gene expression.
TI  - Regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the Asia-Pacific region (SENTRY 1998-2002).
AB  - We examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter koseri, and Salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of the SENTRY Asia-Pacific Surveillance Program between 1998 and 2002. During the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for ESBL production and hyperproduction of K. oxytoca chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase enzyme. High rates of confirmed ESBL-producing isolates were found in K. pneumoniae strains from Singapore (35.6%), followed by those from mainland China (30.7%), South Africa (28.1%), and the Philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in Japan and Australia. ESBL-producing E. coli strains were also prominent in mainland China (24.5%), Hong Kong (14.3%), and Singapore (11.3%). ESBL-producing K. oxytoca were common in the Philippines (38.5%), Singapore (33.3%), and China (30.0%). Hyperproduction of K. oxytoca chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in Australia and Japan. P. mirabilis strains from Singapore produced ESBL (17.9%) despite the low prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. Few ESBL-producing C. koseri and Salmonella spp. strains were found in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Africa. Although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive ESBL phenotype in K. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in E. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for the confirmation of ESBL production. ESBL-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Imipenem retained activity against all ESBL-producing strains. Organisms expressing ESBLs are widely distributed in the Asia-Pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at Dermatology Department, Poznan University Hospital.
AB  - Effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. Antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. Various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. The aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. Wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. Bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. The analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. The study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.
TI  - Bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to Department of Dermatology,  Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
AB  - Venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. The percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the European population is about 1%-2%. The aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. Bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. In 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included Staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), Enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), Proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and Escherichia coli (12.57%). There was a significant increase in the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. The rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly Candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance: from the results of ONERBA's networks to good antibiotic  use].
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata Cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. Inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. Zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/mL. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding MIC values. Contact bioautography, indicated that Zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Activity-guided fractionation of 1he ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with MIC values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/mL for Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/mL). Zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobials of bacterial strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients hospitalised in intensive care units].
AB  - The aim of the study was estimation of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of gram-negative rods isolated from clinical specimens obtained from patients requiring intensive care, with emphasis on profile of the unit. The analysis comprised strains of gram-negative rods isolated from patients of two intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital (1200 beds). Identification of cultured isolates was done using automated VITEK and API systems (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested by a disk-diffusion method according to the NCCLS recommendations. In total the analysis comprised 722 strains of gram-negative rods. In blood cultures predominated strains of Enterobacter spp. (42.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (37.5%). In cultures of clinical specimens other than blood 41.6% comprised strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14.8% Escherichia coli and 14.4% Proteus mirabilis. Frequency of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae was much higher among blood isolates in comparison to strains cultured from other clinical specimens. There was a relatively high percentage of strains of Enterobacteriaceae susceptible to piperacillin and tazobactam (69.0%) and ceftazidime (54.6%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. All strains were susceptible to carbapenems. 2. There was a relatively high percentage of strains of gram-negative rods susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. 3. Bacteria isolated from blood cultures were characterised by a much higher percentage of resistant strains in comparison to other specimens. 4. Longer stay in ICU promoted selection of strains resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Potency and spectrum of tigecycline tested against an international collection of bacterial pathogens associated with skin and soft tissue infections (2000-2004).
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 5289 bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with skin and soft tissue infections during 2000-2004. Strains were submitted from >70 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe, and were tested centrally using reference broth microdilution methods. The top 10 ranking pathogens (95% of total) recovered included Staphylococcus aureus (55.2%), Enterococcus spp. (9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%), Escherichia coli (5.6%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (5.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.9%), Enterobacter spp. (2.8%), Klebsiella spp. (2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (1.7%), and indole-positive Proteae (1.2%). All staphylococci (S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci), enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and E. coli were inhibited by < or =2 microg/mL of tigecycline; in addition, 97% of Klebsiella spp., 95% of Enterobacter spp., and 97% of Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited at this concentration. Only P. aeruginosa and all Proteae (MIC90, 16 microg/mL) displayed elevated MIC values to tigecycline. The broad spectrum of activity exhibited by this glycylcycline included tetracycline-resistant organism subsets, as well as oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enteric bacilli strains. Tigecycline represents a new choice among broad-spectrum parenteral agents for the common Gram-positive and -negative pathogens producing serious infections of skin and soft tissues.
TI  - Elevated levels of IgM and IgA antibodies to Proteus mirabilis and IgM antibodies to Escherichia coli are associated with early rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibodies to Proteus mirabilis were previously detected in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the prevalence of antibodies to P. mirabilis and their associations with RA in early synovitis patients. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-six patients with inflammatory arthritis for less than 1 yr were prospectively evaluated for 1 yr. Of these patients, 30% had rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive RA, 16% RF-negative RA, 17% a spondyloarthropathy and 37% undifferentiated arthritis. Serum antibodies to P. mirabilis, Escherichia coli and other potentially arthritogenic organisms (Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia and parvovirus B19) and for antibodies specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G damaged with advanced glycation end-products (anti-IgG-AGE) were measured. RESULTS: IgM and IgA anti-Proteus antibodies were significantly higher in patients with RF-positive RA compared with all other patient groups (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.005). Anti-P. mirabilis IgG, and IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to other potentially arthritogenic pathogens did not differ in the patient groups. IgM antibodies to E. coli were elevated in RF-positive RA patients. Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA results were not explained by false-positive reactions, because after absorption of RF there was no decrease in antibodies to Proteus in 10 of 12 patients. Proteus and E. coli antibodies were highest in patients positive for both RF and anti-IgG-AGE antibodies (P<0.001). Patients with erosions tended to have higher IgA anti-Proteus titres, but no association with the shared HLA epitope or treatment was detected. CONCLUSION: Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA and anti-E. coli IgM antibody elevations are associated with early seropositive RA and the presence of anti-IgG-AGE antibodies. The role that P. mirabilis or E. coli plays in early RF-positive RA requires further investigation.
TI  - Inhibitor-based methods for detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Non-beta-lactam inhibitor-based methods were evaluated for detecting plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. Using CLSI methodology and disks containing cefotetan alone and in combination with 400 mug of boronic acid, 9 of 10 positive control strains and 54 of 55 AmpC-PCR-positive clinical isolates were detected. Importantly 71% and 40% of these clinical isolates were susceptible by routine testing to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, respectively. Boronic acid disks also enhanced detection of expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases in AmpC producers.
TI  - Effects of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria on the level of thiols in blood platelets.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS) activates blood platelets and stimulates generation of free radicals in these cells. The mechanism of platelet activation induced by LPS is not known. The aim of the present study was to examine how glutathione (GSH) and other thiol-containing compounds are involved in the oxidative stress in blood platelets caused by LPS. The HPLC technique has been used on the analysis of non-protein thiols from human blood platelets treated with lipopolysaccharides of different gram-negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Our results show that LPSs caused an increase (about 10%) of the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and other nonprotein thiols such as cysteine (CSH) and cysteinylglycine (CGSH), whereas the total pool of these compounds was almost unchanged. LPS may react directly with thiols, since after incubation of LPSs with glutathione alone (in reduced form) we observed a distinct decrease of the level of platelet GSH.
TI  - Fatal herpes simplex virus infection in Darier disease under corticotherapy.
AB  - A 67-year-old man is presented with longstanding and severe Darier disease treated by topical antiseptics and potent corticosteroids, in combination with oral glucocorticoids and etretinate. After cardiac bypass surgery in 1997, the patient experienced herpes simplex virus (HSV type-1) infection of the skin that was treated by intravenous aciclovir. In 2003, he presented a widespread atypical exacerbation of his Darier disease, involving the face, trunk, buttocks, intertriginous areas and arms. Initial clinical signs and bacteriological findings suggested a bacterial involvement by multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Despite antibiotherapy, the clinical presentation progressively worsened. A skin biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical examination identified a type-2 HSV infection. Although intravenous aciclovir was administered, the widespread cutaneous HSV infection was followed by systemic dissemination. A severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed, leading to a fatal issue. At autopsy, a severe interstitial type-2 HSV pneumonitis with extensive necrotic areas was found, in association with gastro-intestinal involvement. This case represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of Darier disease presenting a fatal type-2 HSV infection. It underlines the importance of rapidly recognizing HSV infection in Darier disease and stresses the risk of lethal outcome. The different risk factors for HSV infection in this patient are reviewed.
TI  - Antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ethanol extract from Paullinia cupana Mart.
AB  - The antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract from Paullinia  cupana var. sorbilis Mart. (Sapindaceae) seeds, commonly called guarana, was assessed towards selected bacteria as well as in different antioxidant models. The extract, at a concentration between 16 and 128 microg/ml, showed a significant antibacterial effect expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=16 microg/ml), Proteus mirabilis (MIC=32 microg/ml), Proteus vulgaris (MIC=32 microg/ml) and Escherichia coli (MIC=32 microg/ml) were the most inhibited. The antioxidant activity was determined by the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) test, measuring the MDA concentration in 3T3-L1 cells after induced cellular damage using ferric ammonium citrate (FAC). The reduction of lipid peroxidation was 62.5% using a guarana extract with a concentration of 2 microg/ml. This effect was dose/dependent. The ethanol extract from Paullinia cupana seeds was analysed by spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of catechol substances after treatment of the extract with p-aminophenol. The total phenolics content in the ethanol extract was also determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The concentration of catechol equivalent was 6.06+/-0.13 mg/g (mean+/-S.D.), while the total phenolic content was 8.43+/-0.21 mg/g (mean+/-S.D.). The correlation index between antioxidant activity and catechol content was 0.96.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter Italian survey: possible impact on guidelines.
AB  - During 2004 four Italian Laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. A total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. The overall prevalence of Escherichia coli was 85.3%. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. Determination of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of E. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). Cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. The three fluoquinolones tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. Nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. Against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. The results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent Italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of UTI in this country today.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - The first beta-lactamase was identified in an isolate of Escherichia coli in 1940. To date, there are >130 TEM-type and >50 sulfhydryl variable (SHV)-type beta-lactamases, mainly in E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis but also in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and in some nonenteric organisms, such as Acinetobacter species. The incidence of expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) varies, depending on which area of the globe the isolates originate from. ESBLs render the oxyimino-cephalosporins ineffective, and ESBL-producing organisms frequently also possess resistance factors to other classes of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and possibly also piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. These results suggest that microbiology laboratories should routinely test for the presence of these strains among their isolates and that the antibiotics of choice for infections believed to be caused by these types of organisms are the carbapenems.
TI  - Molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant Proteus mirabilis isolates from retail meat products.
AB  - Sixty-four multidrug-resistant isolates of Proteus mirabilis were collected from  retail meat products in Oklahoma. The isolates showed four different patterns of antibiotic resistance based on their resistant phenotype and genotypes. Most of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamycin, and kanamycin. Class 1 integrons were detected as a common carrier of the antibiotic-resistant genes, such as aadA1, aadB, and aadA2. A few isolates (9%) contained class 2 integrons with three gene cassettes included: dhfr1, sat1, and aadA1. These isolates were even resistant to nalidixic acid due to mutations in gyrA and parC. All ampicillin-resistant isolates contained blaTEM-1. Plasmids that contained class 1 or 2 integrons and blaTEM-1 were able to be transferred from P. mirabilis isolates into Escherichia coli by conjugation, indicating that conjugal transfer could contribute to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes between the Enterobacteriaceae species.
TI  - [Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: presentation of an unusual case].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a morphologically and clinically unique manifestation of chronic pyelonephritis with the formation of pus or granulomas. The most frequent predisposing factors for the development of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis are urinary obstruction (e. g., stones, tumors, congenital anomalies and functional impairment) and infection of the collecting system. CASE REPORT: We describe a 2-year-old female patient with unclear abdominal complaints, diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, pale skin color, and recurrent and undulating fever in the presence of known left nephrolithiasis. Based on the clinical examination and imaging, above all, CT, the presumptive diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis of the left kidney was made. A left lumbar nephrectomy was performed and histology confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a relatively rare entity that is associated with obstruction (e. g., stones) and infection of the urinary tract. Its rarity and resultant unfamiliarity often delay diagnosis and therapy, which in turn affect the prognosis. Furthermore, this entity can be mistaken for renal tumors (renal cell carcinoma and Wilms tumor), but nowadays this should be mostly eliminated with the advances in the imaging methods.
TI  - AmpC disk test for detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae lacking chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - Although plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases were first reported in the late 1980s, many infectious disease personnel remain unaware of their clinical importance. These enzymes are typically produced by isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. and are associated with multiple antibiotic resistance that leaves few therapeutic options. Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been associated with false in vitro susceptibility to cephalosporins. Many laboratories do not test for this resistance mechanism because current tests are inconvenient, subjective, lack sensitivity and/or specificity, or require reagents that are not readily available. In this study a new test, the AmpC disk test, based on filter paper disks impregnated with EDTA, was found to be a highly sensitive, specific, and convenient means of detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in organisms lacking a chromosomally mediated AmpC beta-lactamase. Using cefoxitin insusceptibility as a screen, the test accurately distinguished AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production and differentiated AmpCs from non-beta-lactamase mechanisms of cefoxitin insusceptibility, such as reduced outer membrane permeability. The test is a potentially useful diagnostic tool. It can provide important infection control information and help to ensure that infected patients receive appropriate antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance transformation in community-acquired urinary infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the prevalence of uropathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infection in our environment, and the degree of sensitivity to antibiotics used as empirical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective longitudinal study on 16,392 consecutive urine cultures collected in the emergency department of Hospital del Mar, between January 1997 and December 2001. Resistance rates were compared through variance analysis. RESULTS: 8,743 urine cultures with significant count were obtained. 6,062 Escherichia coli (69.3%), 517 Proteus mirabilis (5.9%) and 390 Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.5%) were identified. Escherichia coli showed progressive growth rate and significant resistances to most of antibiotics evaluated, especially to quinolones which came close to 30%. Fosfomycin showed the least resistance rate (0.9%) and remained stable along the years studied. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that higher rate of resistance to quinolones does not advise its use as empirical in community-acquired urinary tract infection treatment in our environment. According to our experience, fosfomycin can be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without risk factors, while for the treatment of parenchymatous urinary tract infection, complicated urinary tract infections, and urinary tract infections associated to risk factors, preference could be second or third generation oral cephalosporins, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Spread of novel expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae in a university hospital in the Paris area, France.
AB  - In 2002, 28 non-duplicate enterobacterial isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were collected from infected patients at the Bicetre Hospital in Paris, France. Escherichia coli was the predominant ESBL-positive enterobacterial species, comprising ten (36%) of the isolates. CTX-M enzymes (CTX-M-3, CTX-M-10, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15) were produced by 11 (39%) of the isolates (six E. coli, two Enterobacter cloacae, one Enterobacter aerogenes, one Proteus mirabilis and one Citrobacter freundii). Other ESBLs, such as VEB-1 and PER-1, were also detected, but less frequently.
TI  - Adaptation to extreme environments: macromolecular dynamics in complex systems.
AB  - What we previously thought of as insurmountable physical and chemical barriers to life, we now see as yet another niche harbouring 'extremophiles'. Extremophiles and their macromolecules had to develop molecular mechanisms of adaptation to extreme physico-chemical conditions. Using neutron spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that molecular dynamics represents one of these molecular mechanisms of adaptation. To which extent do hyper-saline conditions and extreme temperatures influence molecular dynamics? First, molecular dynamics were analysed for halophilic malate dehydrogenase from Haloarcula marismortui (Hm MalDH) under different molar solvent salt concentration conditions influencing its stability. Secondly, mean macromolecular motions were measured in-vivo in psychrophile (Aquaspirillum arcticum), mesophile (Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis), thermophile (Thermus thermophilus), and hyperthermophile (Aquifex pyrofilus) bacteria. The mean constant force of Hm MalDH increases progessively with increasing stability. The results show that the molecular adaptation of Hm MalDH to hyper-saline conditions is achieved through an increasing resilience of its structure dominated by enthalpic mechanisms. The study of bacteria has provided tools to quantify the macromolecular adaptation to extreme temperatures in the naturally crowded environment of the cell. The macromolecular resilience of bacteria increases with adaptation to high temperatures.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated, inducible AmpC beta-lactamase (DHA-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae at a Korean hospital: wide dissemination in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca and emergence in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of recently emerging cefoxitin-resistant and induction-positive isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis. Strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated at a Korean tertiary care hospital between June and December 2002. Induction was tested using cefoxitin and aztreonam disks, the blaDHA allele was detected by PCR, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were also analyzed. Among the cefoxitin-resistant isolates, 2.7% of E. coli, 21.1% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.0% of Klebsiella oxytoca, and 8.3% of P. mirabilis isolates showed induction, and were blaDHA-1 allele positive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaDHA-1 in P. mirabilis. The MICs of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam increased significantly by higher inoculum, suggesting that their clinical usefulness is limited. Presence of multiple PFGE patterns and identical patterns in some isolates suggest that the widely disseminated blaDHA-1 in Klebsiella species was because of both horizontal and clonal spread.
TI  - Prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 10-day regimen of prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily as compared to ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 257 patients (mean age +/- SD 62.3 +/- 16.5) were enrolled and orally treated with prulifloxacin (127 patients) or ciprofloxacin (130 patients). The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled clinical trial. The primary efficacy parameter was the eradication of infecting strains (<10(3) cfu/ml). The clinical outcome and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, the most common infecting strains were Escherichia coli (62.8%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%). At the early follow-up, the rate of patients showing successful treatment was 90.8% in the prulifloxacin group, and 77.8% in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.008). A positive clinical outcome was observed in 94.8 and 93.3% of prulifloxacin- and ciprofloxacin-treated patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. Two patients dropped out for treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The high urinary concentrations of prulifloxacin, combined with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, allow its use in the empiric therapy of UTIs.
TI  - Bacterial infections--the cause of preterm delivery.
AB  - Within diagnostic procedures protocols in preterm delivery, the objective of the  study was to examine bacterial causes of preterm deliveries in relation to term deliveries. The study included 106 patients delivered before term (24 to 37 weeks of gestation) and 126 patients with term delivery after 37 to 42 weeks of gestation. Bacterial analysis included hospital material: cervix smear in patients before the delivery and protective and functional fetal elements.
TI  - Detection of Paragonimus heterotremus eggs in experimentally infected cats by a polymerase chain reaction-based method.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure for the detection of Paragonimus heterotremus eggs in stool samples was developed and compared with Stoll's egg count method. The primers were designed on the basis of a previously constructed pPH-13-specific DNA probe, which produced an approximate 0.5-kb amplified product. This PCR method could detect as few as 5 eggs in 0.6 g of artificially inoculated feces of a healthy control cat or as little as 1 x 10(-4) ng of P. heterotremus genomic DNA. The assay had 100% sensitivity in all infected cats. The method did not yield an approximate 0.5-kb product with DNA from other parasites such as Gnathostoma spinigerum, Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola gigantica, Echinostoma malayanum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Dirofilaria immitis, and Taenia saginata; exceptions were Paragonimus siamensis and Paragonimus westermani. In addition, no genomic DNA from Escherichia coli, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Acinetobacter anitratus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-Streptococcus grA, and Proteus mirabilis or from the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts of P. heterotremus was amplified in the PCR assay. This assay has great potential for application in clinical epidemiological studies.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - An ethnobotanical survey of Bauchi State herbal plants and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A survey of medicinal plants used locally in the treatment of various diseases was carried out in Bauchi State-Nigeria. A total of 84 medicinal plants were listed. Preliminary antimicrobial activity of the aqueous extracts of the plants was investigated. The results indicated that out of 84 plants, 75 exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the test organisms at a concentration of 200 mg/ml. The extracts were found to show potentially interesting activity against Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of ibafloxacin in micro-organisms isolated from cats.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of ibafloxacin were investigated in micro-organisms isolated from cats. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ibafloxacin (racemate, R- and S-enantiomers) and its metabolites (7-hydroxy- and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin) and time-kill kinetics were determined against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from dermal and respiratory and urinary tract infections in cats. Racemic ibafloxacin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. Escherichia coli and Pasteurella, Klebsiella and Staphylococcus spp. are commonly isolated from feline infections and all are susceptible to ibafloxacin (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microg/mL), whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus spp. are considered intrinsic resistant. Microbiological activity resides primarily in the S-enantiomer of ibafloxacin whereas the R-enantiomer is less active. Killing curves using concentrations of racemic ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which are representative of the in vivo situation observed in cats, showed at least 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial isolates from feline clinical samples over 24 h. Bacterial eradication was achieved in cats with Cmax/MIC and AUC/MIC values much lower than the target values previously established in man and laboratory animals. Additional studies in dogs and cats are necessary to define more clearly the surrogate markers of antibacterial activity (i.e. Cmax/MIC, AUC/MIC ratios), which are associated with a good clinical response.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Longitudinal trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities across long-term-care facilities: emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance in the longterm-care facility (LTCF) setting is of increasing concern due to both the increased morbidity and mortality related to infections in this debilitated population and the potential for transfer of resistant organisms to other healthcare settings. Longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance in LTCFs have not been well described. DESIGN: Correlational longitudinal survey study. SETTING: Four LTCFs in Pennsylvania. SUBJECTS: All clinical cultures of residents of the participating LTCFs (700 total beds) from 1998 through 2003. We assessed the annual prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials of interest for the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus species. RESULTS: A total of 4,954 clinical isolates were obtained during the study. A high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted for many organism-drug combinations. This was especially true for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae (susceptibility range, 51.3% to 92.2%). In addition, the prevalence of resistance to various agents differed significantly across study sites. Finally, significant increasing trends in resistance were noted over time and were most pronounced for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has increased significantly in LTCFs, although trends have varied substantially across different institutions. These trends have been particularly pronounced for fluoroquinolone resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae. These findings demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance is widespread and increasing in LTCFs, highlighting the need for future studies to more clearly elucidate the risk factors for, and potential interventions against, emerging resistance in these settings.
TI  - Influence of various criteria for elimination of duplicates when calculating the  prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms associated with urinary infections.
AB  - The effect of applying various criteria for elimination of repeated isolates in the same patient on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms frequently associated with urinary infections were analyzed. When time criteria were applied, there was a decrease in the number of isolates of 13.4-27.5%, whereas when variations in antibiotic susceptibility were considered, between 4.3 and 20.3% of the isolates were eliminated. The absolute number of isolates varied considerably depending on which of these two criteria were used, but neither criterion was seen to modify significantly the antibiotic susceptibility of these microorganisms and this confirms the recommendations of the NCCLS for this group of pathogens.
TI  - Enhanced biofilm-production in pathogens isolated from patients with rare metabolic disorders.
AB  - Biofilm-producing bacteria were isolated from the urine of 19 patients with very  rare metabolic disorders including: hyperlactacidaemia (8 cases), sugar intolerance and gammopathy (1 case), cystinuria (2 cases), Parkinson's disease (1 case), lipidaemia (2 cases), hyperaminoaciduria (1 case) and others (4 cases). A total of 34 strains were collected, Gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms were equally distributed among the slime-producing bacteria, with a prevalence of Staphylococcus epidermidis (30%) the most frequent microorganism isolated together with Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis that accounted for 15% of this group of strains. A quantitative assay of the biofilm production revealed that in Gram-positive pathogens it was three times greater than that observed in bacteria collected from patients not affected by metabolic diseases (p = 0.0001). In Gram-negative strains the biofilm synthesis was 2.2 times higher than those detected in the same bacteria isolated in the absence of metabolic disorders (p = 0.0033). The results observed indicate that biofilm production is enhanced in bacteria isolated from the urine of patients with metabolic disorders. It is suggested that unusual metabolites might facilitate pathogen production of biofilm found in the urine of these patients.
TI  - Rapid, species-specific detection of uropathogen 16S rDNA and rRNA at ambient temperature by dot-blot hybridization and an electrochemical sensor array.
AB  - Development of rapid molecular approaches for pathogen detection is key to improving treatment of infectious diseases. For this study, the kinetics and temperature-dependence of DNA probe hybridization to uropathogen species-specific sequences were examined. A set of oligonucleotide probes were designed based on variable regions of the 16S gene of the Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A universal bacterial probe and probes-specific for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also included. The oligonucleotide probes discriminated among 16S genes derived from 11 different species of uropathogenic bacteria applied to nylon membranes in a dot-blot format. Significant binding of oligonucleotide probes to target DNA and removal of nonspecific binding by membrane washing could both be achieved rapidly, requiring as little as 10 min. An oligonucleotide probe from the same species-specific region of the E. coli 16S gene was used as a capture probe in a novel electrochemical 16-sensor array based on microfabrication technology. Sequence-specific hybridization of target uropathogen 16S rDNA was detected through horseradish peroxidase acting as an electrochemical transducer via a second, detector probe. The sensor array demonstrated rapid, species-specific hybridization in a time course consistent with the rapid kinetics of the dot-blot hybridization studies. As in the dot-blot hybridization studies, species-specific detection of bacterial nucleic acids using the sensor array approach was demonstrated both at 65 degrees C and at room temperature. These results demonstrate that molecular hybridization approaches can be adapted to rapid, room temperature conditions ideal for an electrochemical sensor array platform.
TI  - Microbial resistance to antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections in Mexican children.
AB  - Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in female children. This infection has a prevalence of 4.1 to 7.1% during infancy. The bacterial agents causing the urinary tract infection are Escherichia coil (80-90%), followed by other gram negative germs such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus species and gram positive such as Staphylococcus species. Typical treatment for this infection is ampicillin or the mixture of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMT/SMX) among others. However, a high incidence of microbial resistance to these antibiotics has been observed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the microbial resistance of the most frequent infectious agents in urinary tract of Mexican children from January to December 2000. A total of 725 urinary cultures were collected during all year. Of these, 293 patients were positive of the most frequently reported bacteria including Escherichia coil (205 patients, 69.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (67 patients, 22.8%) and Proteus mirabilis (21 patients, 7.1%). Infections produced by Escherichia coil were highly resistant to ampicillin (83.5%) and TMT/SMX (76.7%). Results indicate a high incidence of microbial resistance to ampicillin and TMT/SMX in urinary tract infections in Mexican children and suggest caution before giving a treatment with antibiotic in this condition.
TI  - Evaluation of a new screen agar plate for detection and presumptive identification of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - A new agar screen plate for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection was evaluated with 50 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species: Enterobacter cloacae (n = 10), Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 25), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Fecal samples were artificially inoculated with 2 concentrations (25 and 250 colony forming units [CFU]/plate) of the test strains and then applied to the new agar screen plates. By this approach, the new agar formula detected growth that was suggestive of ESBL activity in 44 of 50 (88%) and 50 of 50 (100%) of ESBL strains with 25 and 250 CFU/plate, respectively. A limitation of the agar screen plates was a lack of some specificity. Among 15 strains with resistant phenotypes other than ESBL (K1 producers of K. oxytoca, 6 strains; 9 strains with AmpC phenotype), growth was recorded in 7 (25 CFU/plate) and 11 (250 CFU/plate) of 15 strains. In conclusion, the new agar screen plate is a sensitive and convenient method to directly screen for ESBL organisms in rectal swabs or stool samples, with the potential for incorporation into routine clinical laboratory service.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates among more than 5000 European Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using Enterobacteriaceae isolated during the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). Of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). Carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all isolates). ESBL-production was confirmed with the ESBL-Etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of Escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6% of Klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of Proteus mirabilis isolates.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Traditional medicine in Sakarya province (Turkey) and antimicrobial activities of selected species.
AB  - Traditional medicine in North-West of Turkey (Sakarya province) were studied during a 2 months field study by interviewing local informants from several villages. Plant species used to treat infections were tested for antimicrobial activity. Information was collected for 46 plant species from 30 families and for 5 animal species. Twenty four of the plant species were cultivated. Most used families were Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae and the most used plants were Artemisia absinthium, Equisetum telmateia, Lavandula stoechas, Melissa officinalis, Tussilago farfara and Urtica dioica. A total of 139 medicinal uses were obtained. Plants are used mainly for infectious diseases (18%), for neurological and psychological disorders (13.7%), cardiovascular disorders (13%), skin disorders (12.2%) and respiratory disorders (10.1%). Extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231, using microbroth dilution technique according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). This research showed that Arum maculatum, Datura stramonium, Geranium asphodeloides and Equisetum telmateia petroleum ether extracts had MIC values of 39.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml and 39.1 microg/ml, respectively against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Datura stramonium petroleum ether extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli and Trachystemon orientalis ethanol extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial activity of Arum maculatum, Equisetum telmateia, Geranium asphodeloides, Plantago intermedia, Senecio vulgaris and Trachystemon orientalis has been reported here for the first time.
TI  - Evaluation of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the performance of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of various species. METHODS: Organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains comprising Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae (10), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) and Proteus mirabilis (4). Also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking ESBLs, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of AmpC enzyme in Citrobacter freundii (2), E. aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (3), E. coli (4), Hafnia alvei (1) and Morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in K. pneumoniae (3) and E. coli (3) or hyperproduction of K1 enzyme in K. oxytoca (6). RESULTS: The MicroScan MIC-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 ESBL strains as ESBL-positive and 23 of 30 non-ESBL strains as ESBL-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). False negatives among ESBL producers were highest with Enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. False-positive classifications occurred in two Acinetobacter spp., one E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase and two K. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: The MicroScan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for ESBL confirmation. However, this test has limitations in detecting ESBLs in Enterobacter spp. and in discriminating ESBL-related resistance from the K1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - [Profile of antimicrobial resistance of agents causing urinary tract infections in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The management of urinary tract infection in children faces the problem of the emergence of resistant strains to antibiotics. The aim of this study is to precise the frequency of the different germs and their susceptibility to antibiotics. METHODS: We report a retrospective study concerning 200 cases of urinary tract infection hospitalised in the paediatric department of Monastir between January 1995 and December 2000. There were 58 boys and 142 girls aged between two months and 14 years with a mean age of 5 years. The frequency of urinary tract infection is 1.85%. RESULTS: The most common causative agent is Escherichia coli in 75.5% of cases, followed by Proteus mirabilis (10%) then by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%). Escherichia coli is predominant in girls, whereas Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are likely encountred in boys. Of all the strains, 96% are resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cefalotin, 67% to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and 34% to cotrimoxazole. A resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cefalotin is noted in 96% of the germs. The resistance is of 67% for amoxicillin + clavulanic-acid and of 34% for cotrimoxazole. However, third generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides remain usually active on the majority of strains incriminated in these infections a part from Pseudomonas.
TI  - [Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: clinical, radiological and pathologic characteristics].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an atypical chronic infection which simulates a malignant renal neoplasia, definitive diagnosis of which is obtained by pathologic study after surgical removal. In this paper we analyze our experience and compare it to that reported on the literature. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of cases of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis diagnosed in the period from January 1945 to December 2000 at the Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, analyzing clinical, radiological, and surgical features documented in the medical records. RESULTS: There were 11 cases, 82% of them were females. The presence of signs and symptoms such as pain and abdominal mass appeared in 73%, accompanied by hematuria and fever. Most radiological tests showed destruction of the renal parenchyma with abnormalities in the collecting system and obstruction by lithiasis. 91% of the cases had positive urine cultures, being Escherichia coli, Proteus Mirabilis and Klebsiella the most frequent germs. Simple nephrectomy was the surgical treatment, and complications were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal cancer because of its clinical features.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  - Escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), followed by Staphylococcus spp. especially Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Proteus mirabilis. Against E. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated UTI, faropenem was the most effective. Up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated UTI, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. Various types of organisms were isolated in patients with complicated UTI. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the three most frequent organisms isolated. These three organisms accounted for 44.6%. Amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against E. coli followed by cephems. The rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. Fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. Against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. About 17% of Pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. Eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all E. faecalis isolates; about 60% of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. The rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. UTIs caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are rare in Japan.
TI  - Urinary calculi: bacteriological and chemical association.
AB  - We investigated the bacteriology of urinary calculi in relation to urinary tract  infection, stone formation, chemical composition and antibiotic sensitivity. Fifty-two patients (37 males, 15 females) with urolithiasis were studied. Urine, serum and urinary calculi specimens were taken and serum biochemical tests to detect uric acid, calcium and phosphorus were performed. Urine analysis and culture were also performed. Of the 52 patients, 19 (37%) had associated urinary tract infection, with Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis being the most common causative microorganisms. The bacterial isolates from urine and those from calculi differed in their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. We conclude that in over 50% of patients with urolithiasis, urine culture can detect the infecting organisms associated with stone formation and the organisms within urinary calculi.
TI  - Incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in a pediatric hospital.
AB  - The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was analyzed in Enterobacteriaceae population circulating in the Upper Silesian Child and Mother Health Center in Katowice (USC&MHC). Altogether 1164 clinical specimens, collected from children hospitalized in 8 different hospital units of USC&MHC were investigated. Five hundred and eighty-five clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae were identified in specimens collected from 403 patients. Two hundred and twenty-nine Enterobacteriaceae strains (39%) isolated from 162 patients were found to be putative ESBL producers as revealed by double-disc synergy (DDS) test. ESBL activity was the most prevalent in the population of Klebsiella pneumoniae (77%), followed by Klebsiella oxytoca (50%), Serratia marcescens (43%), Escherichia coli (30%), Enterobacter spp. (18%) and Proteus mirabilis (12%). ESBL producers demonstrated also wide resistance to the non-beta-lactam antimicrobial co-trimoxazole (93%) and the aminoglycosides netilmicin (88%), gentamicin (84%) and amikacin (79%).
TI  - Proteus mirabilis ZapA metalloprotease degrades a broad spectrum of substrates, including antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The 54-kDa extracellular metalloprotease ZapA is an important virulence factor of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis. While ZapA has the ability to degrade host immunoglobulins (Igs), the dramatic attenuation of virulence in ZapA mutants suggests that this enzyme may have a broader spectrum of activity. This hypothesis was tested by in vitro assays with purified ZapA and an array of purified protein or peptide substrates. The data reveal that many proteins found in the urinary tract are substrates of ZapA proteolysis, including complement (C1q and C3), cell matrix (collagen, fibronectin, and laminin), and cytoskeletal proteins (actin and tubulin). Proteolysis of IgA and IgG was significantly enhanced by conditions that denatured the Igs. It was discovered that the antimicrobial peptides human beta-defensin 1 (hBD1) and LL-37 are readily cleaved by the enzyme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterial protease capable of cleaving hBD1, a component of the human renal tubule innate immune response. Proteolysis of hBD1 resulted in ca. six peptides, while proteolysis of LL-37 resulted in at least nine products. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of the molecular masses of the reaction products indicated that ZapA preferred no distinct peptide bond. The antimicrobial activity of hBD1 and LL-37 was significantly reduced following ZapA treatment, suggesting that proteolysis results in inactivation of these peptides. The data suggest that a function of ZapA during urinary tract infections is the proteolysis of antimicrobial peptides associated with the innate immune response.
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Incidence of enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus in day care centers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus in four day care centers in Akwa Ibom State was studied using culture techniques. The percentage frequencies of the isolates from 124 samples were Staphylococcus aureus (33.9), Escherichia coli (19.0), Klebsiella sp (14.4), Citrobacter sp (12.5) and Proteus mirabilis (7.4). The sources of contamination were floors, chairs, skin, bed linen, door handles, fans, children's tables, walls, windows, ceiling, headmistress's table and chairs, drinking water and wash water. Cultures from Aunty Chimmy's Day Care and Nursery School, Eket and Ideal Day Care and Nursery School, Eket yielded more organisms than those from Trinity International Nursery School, Ikot Ekpene and Adiaha Obong Day Care Center in Uyo. The results revealed the insanitary conditions in these day care centers. The enforcement of an effective public health enlightenment program is advocated in order to attract sufficient attention of the proprietors of these establishments to the role of fomites as reservoirs of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of AVE1330A, an innovative broad-spectrum non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Production of beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Despite the current use of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam, the prevalence of class A and class C enzymes is increasing worldwide, demanding new beta-lactamase inhibitors. Here we report the antimicrobial properties of AVE1330A, a representative of a novel class of bridged bicyclico[3.2.1]diazabicyclo-octanones in combination with ceftazidime. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IC(50) and kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis reaction were used to characterize beta-lactamase inhibition by AVE1330A. MICs for >600 strains were determined with the combination ceftazidime/AVE1330A at a fixed ratio of 4:1. RESULTS: IC(50)s of AVE1330A for TEM-1 and P99 enzymes were 0.0023 mg/L (8 nM) and 0.023 mg/L (80 nM), compared with 0.027 mg/L (130 nM) and 205.1 mg/L (1 x 10(6) nM) of clavulanic acid and 0.013 mg/L (40 nM) and 1.6 mg/L (5000 nM) of tazobactam. A highly stable covalent complex led to a low turnover of AVE1330A. MICs of ceftazidime/AVE1330A for Enterobacteriaceae were at least eight-fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone. All of the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter and Proteus mirabilis strains, including ceftazidime-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 4-8 mg/L. Only 2 mg/L were required to inhibit other Proteeae, Enterobacter, Salmonella and Serratia. CONCLUSION: The combination of ceftazidime with AVE1330A exhibited broad-spectrum activity against Ambler class A- and class C-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). During a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. Fever higher than 38.5 degrees C was significantly more common in the bacteremic group than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. E. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic UTI than non-bacteremic UTI (73% vs 49%; p<0.01). Bacteria other than E. coli (i.e., K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic UTI than bacteremic UTI (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). E. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). Isolates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. The emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic UTI in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome in these conditions.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Evolution of acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae in a Tunisian hospital 1993-2001.
AB  - Between January 1993 and December 2001, the overall frequency of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, rose from 2.4% to 7.4%. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent species (56%), followed by Escherichia coli (15%) and Proteus mirabilis (9%). A rate of 49% was observed among isolates from paediatric patients in 1999, caused mostly by outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit of K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis isolates that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of cobalt(II), copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes of kefzol.
AB  - Kefzol (kzl), a beta-lactam antibiotic, possesses various donor sites for interaction with transition metal(II) ions [Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II)] to form complexes of the type [M(kzl)2]Cl2 and [M(kzl)Cl], with molar ratio of metal: ligand (M:L) of 1:2 and 1:1 respectively. These complexes were prepared and characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Their IR and NMR spectra suggest that kefzol potentially acts as a bidentate, tridentate as well as monoanionic tetradentate ligand. The complexes have been screened for antibacterial activity and results were compared with the activity of the uncomplexed antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The metal complexes were found to be more potent against one or more bacterial species than the uncomplexed kefzol.
TI  - Evaluation of the tensile strengths of four monofilament absorbable suture materials after immersion in canine urine with or without bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the tensile strength, elongation, and degradation of 4 monofilament absorbable suture materials that undergo degradation by hydrolysis in specimens of canine urine with various physical characteristics. SAMPLE POPULATION: 4 monofilament absorbable sutures (polydioxanone, poliglecaprone 25, polyglyconate, and glycomer 631). PROCEDURE: Voided urine was collected from 6 healthy dogs, pooled, filter-sterilized, and prepared to provide 5 media: sterile neutral (pH, 7.0), sterile acidic (pH, 6.2), sterile basic (pH, 8.8), Escherichia coli-inoculated, and Proteus mirabilis-inoculated urine. Ten strands of each suture material were immersed in each of the media for 0 to 28 days. Tensile strength and elongation of each suture material were evaluated by use of a texture analyzer on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Reduction in tensile strength was detected for all materials in all urine specimens over time. Polyglyconate and polydioxanone had superior tensile strengths in sterile neutral and E. coli-inoculated urine, and polydioxanone retained the greatest tensile strength throughout the study period. All suture materials disintegrated before day 7 in P. mirabilis-inoculated urine. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Polydioxanone, polyglyconate, and glycomer 631 may be acceptable for urinary bladder closure in the presence of sterile neutral and E. coli-contaminated urine. Tensile strength of poliglecaprone 25 in urine may be unacceptable by the critical healing time for bladder tissue (14 to 21 days). During bladder surgery, exposure of suture material that degrades via hydrolysis to urine containing Proteus spp should be minimized.
TI  - Prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. In all, 45 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. A small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. In the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. In the second group, a disc, which was saturated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. In the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. The silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. There was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. In the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of S. epidermidis in two and Proteus mirabilis in the remaining. Three and four cultures were positive in the second and third group, respectively. Low colonies of four different organisms (Escherichia coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. There was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. Based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Myocardial necrosis in a captive binturong (Arctictis binturong).
AB  - An adult male binturong, Arctictis binturong, which had been anorexic and lethargic for seven days became acutely dyspnoeic and died under anaesthesia. A postmortem examination revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a thrombus occluding the left ventricular chamber. Histological findings included moderate to severe multifocal, vasculocentric myocardial degeneration and necrosis with fibrosis replacing myocardiocytes. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were grown on cultures. The animal's serum vitamin E and selenium levels were considered adequate. The aetiology of the chronic myocardial changes could not be determined.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new ESBL Etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate ESBL Etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: Enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Proteus mirabilis (n=3). To check Etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to ESBL, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of K. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. RESULTS: With this panel, ESBL Etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. Concentrating on Enterobacter spp., reliable ESBL detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed ESBL production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of Enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. A limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with K1 phenotypes of K. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by Etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. CONCLUSION: The new Etest ESBL strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to current methods for detection of ESBLs. In our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of ESBLs, particularly in Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Frequency of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing gram negative bacilli among clinical isolates at clinical laboratories of Army Medical College, Rawalpindi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was carried out in Microbiology department of Army Medical College, Rawalpindi to find out the frequency of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing gram negative bacilli among clinical isolates recovered from clinical specimens received from Military Hospital, Rawalpindi. METHODS: This study was carried out from 1st Jan 2002 to 30th Dec 2002. A total of 812 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli were recovered during the study period from various samples including urine, blood, pus, sputum, high vaginal swab (HVS), aspirates, i/v canula/Central venous lines (CVP), chest tubes and catheter tips. Extended spectrum beta lactamase detection in these isolates was carried out by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. A susceptibility disk containing amoxicillin-clavulanate was placed as the inhibitor of beta lactamase in the center of the plate, and cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam disks were placed 30 mm (center to center) from the amoxicillin-clavulanate disk. Enhancement of the zone of inhibition of the oxyimino-beta-lactam caused by the synergy of the clavulanate in the amoxicillin-clavulanate disk was considered as evidence of ESBL production. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 were used as control strains. RESULTS: The frequency of ESBL producing gram negative bacilli among the clinical isolates was 45%.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of essential oils on microorganisms isolated from urinary tract infection].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from medicinal plants (Ocimum gratissimum, L., Cybopogum citratus (DC) Stapf., and Salvia officinalis, L.) was assessed on bacterial strains derived from 100 urine samples. Samples were taken from subjects diagnosed with urinary tract infection living in the community. Microorganisms were plated on Muller Hinton agar. Plant extracts were applied using a Steers replicator and petri dishes were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Salvia officinalis, L. showed enhanced inhibitory activity compared to the other two herbs, with 100% efficiency against Klebsiella and Enterobacter species, 96% against Escherichia coli, 83% against Proteus mirabilis, and 75% against Morganella morganii.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of recent antibiotic-resistant urinary pathogens to ertapenem and 12 other antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of complicated urinary tract infections may require the use of a parenteral antibiotic with potent activity against the most common urinary pathogens. Ertapenem is a broad-spectrum 1beta-methyl carbapenem with a long plasma half-life that allows administration of a single daily dose. METHODS: The purpose of this work was to test the in vitro susceptibility to ertapenem, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, co-amoxiclav, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole of 482 strains of urinary pathogens of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in the community of Madrid (40% from males). The distribution was as follows: Escherichia coli (n = 315), Proteus mirabilis (n = 42), Klebsiella spp. (n = 14) and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 111). The strains studied were selected based on their resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides, and their production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC-type beta-lactamases. RESULTS: All the strains were susceptible to ertapenem, imipenem and amikacin. The MIC(90) of ertapenem ranged from a minimum of 0.03 mg/L for Proteus vulgaris and a maximum of 1 mg/L for Enterobacter spp. Ertapenem was the most active of all drugs tested in all cases. On comparing antibiotic resistance among ESBL-producing strains of E. coli (n = 35) and E. coli strains not producing ESBLs (n = 280), statistically significant differences were obtained for ciprofloxacin (P = 0.002) and gentamicin (P = 0.011). Regarding ertapenem, only a slight increase in MIC(50) was seen, the value being 0.015 mg/L for strains not producing ESBLs versus 0.03 mg/L for ESBL-producing strains. CONCLUSIONS: In view of its significant antibiotic potency against antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ertapenem may constitute a good therapeutic alternative in urinary infections caused by these pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at Yaounde Central Hospital between March 1995 and April 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). RESULTS: Of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were Enterobacteriaceae. A high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. The proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly higher than that from outpatients (P < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. The rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. Among Enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in E. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and Klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). Wild type (exclusively observed in E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). However, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (Klebsiella spp. (3.5%), E. coli (2.6%), Citrobacter spp. (0.7%), Enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and P. mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. Penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter Gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). However, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. CONCLUSION: As the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.
TI  - [Bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric UTI show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. We intended to evaluate data from northern Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired UTI, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. Inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. Exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent UTI. RESULTS: Patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C, mean CRP of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean WBC 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. In urine cultures E. coli was found in 47 % of the cases, Enterococcus faecalis 23 %, Proteus mirabilis 8 %, Klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. In 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % Enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. Mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in E. coli): Ampicillin 53 % (69 %), Ampicillin and Sulbactam 51 % (61 %), Cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (Cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), Cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (Cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), Cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (Cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), Tobramycin 30 % (2 %), Ciprofloxacine 0 %, Cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), Nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). CONCLUSION: The resistance rates to Ampicillin (+/- Sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to Cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation Cefalosporines increased about 20 %. We conclude that the policies for treatment of UTI in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.
TI  - Cefotaximases (CTX-M-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (CTX-M-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. The CTX-M-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in Enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Isolates of Vibrio cholerae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Aeromonas hydrophila encoding CTX-M-ases have also been reported. The CTX-M-ases belong to the molecular class A beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. This group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. Typically, the CTX-M-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher MICs to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. Phylogenetically, the CTX-M-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of Kluyvera spp. Insertion sequences, especially ISEcp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes of all four subfamilies. The class I integron-associated orf513 also seems to be involved in the mobilization of blaCTX-M genes. This review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the CTX-M-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis genes that contribute to pathogenesis of urinary tract infection: identification of 25 signature-tagged mutants attenuated at least 100-fold.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in individuals with functional or structural abnormalities or with long-term catheterization, forms bladder and kidney stones as a consequence of urease-mediated urea hydrolysis. Known virulence factors, besides urease, are hemolysin, fimbriae, metalloproteases, and flagella. In this study we utilized the CBA mouse model of ascending UTI to evaluate the colonization of mutants of P. mirabilis HI4320 that were generated by signature-tagged mutagenesis. By performing primary screening of 2088 P. mirabilis transposon mutants, we identified 502 mutants that ranged from slightly attenuated to unrecoverable. Secondary screening of these mutants revealed that 114 transposon mutants were reproducibly attenuated. Cochallenge of 84 of these single mutants with the parent strain in the mouse model resulted in identification of 37 consistently out-competed P. mirabilis transposon mutants, 25 of which were out-competed >100-fold for colonization of the bladder and/or kidneys by the parent strain. We determined the sequence flanking the site of transposon insertion in 29 attenuated mutants and identified genes affecting motility, iron acquisition, transcriptional regulation, phosphate transport, urease activity, cell surface structure, and key metabolic pathways as requirements for P. mirabilis infection of the urinary tract. Two mutations localized to a approximately 42-kb plasmid present in the parent strain, suggesting that the plasmid is important for colonization. Isolation of disrupted genes encoding proteins with homologies to known bacterial virulence factors, especially the urease accessory protein UreF and the disulfide formation protein DsbA, showed that the CBA mouse model and mutant pools are a reliable source of attenuated mutants with mutations in virulence genes.
TI  - Mortality in murine peritonitis correlates with increased Escherichia coli adherence to the intestinal mucosa.
AB  - During peritonitis, bacterial adherence is the initial step in a series of events that include mucosal infection, bacterial translocation, organ dysfunction, and death. Adherent Escherichia coli levels increase in response to stress. This study was designed to assess the adherence of E. coli to the cecal mucosa after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) of increasing severity and to determine whether a relationship exists between adherence of bacteria and mortality. Sham surgery, sterile peritonitis (thioglycollate administration), lethal CLP (18-gauge double-puncture), and nonlethal CLP (23-gauge single-puncture) were performed on Swiss Webster mice and compared with normal mice or before CLP (time 0). Specimens of bowel tissue were harvested, and serial log dilutions of homogenized specimens or bowel contents were plated and cultured on media selective for determination of individual bacterial species. Low levels of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis adhered to the mucosa of unmanipulated controls; however, adherence of both species increased significantly by 18 hours after both lethal and nonlethal CLP. After 18 hours, adherent E. coli levels increased by greater than 5 x 10(6)-fold compared to unmanipulated controls, whereas P. mirabilis levels decreased. After nonlethal CLP, adherent P. mirabilis increased 3 x 10(6)-fold compared to unmanipulated animals, whereas E. coli levels did not increase after 24 hours. Sterile peritonitis had little effect on bacterial adherence. Higher levels of adherent E. coli in the cecum correlate with the increased mortality observed after lethal CLP. Higher levels of adherent P. mirabilis appear to prevent the overgrowth of adherent E. coli following nonlethal CLP. Our data indicate that E. coli plays a key role in mortality from polymicrobial peritonitis and that Proteus may be antagonistic to E. coli in murine peritonitis.
TI  - Effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. In this study the activity of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. Subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. Moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC of moxifloxacin. In conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial and antipeptide antibodies in Japanese and Finnish patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - It has been suggested that Proteus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis  of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Bacterial and peptide immune responses in patients with RA and other control subjects were investigated in two geographically different populations. Serum samples from Finnish patients with early ( n=72) and advanced ( n=27) RA and 30 Finnish healthy controls, as well as from Japanese RA patients from two different locations: Tokyo ( n=30) and Otsu ( n=30), 18 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 23 Japanese healthy controls were all screened for the total, and class-specific (IgG, IgA and IgM) antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens by indirect immunofluorescence assay. These samples were also tested for the determination of levels of isotypic antibodies against the shared epitope involving 16-mer synthetic peptides containing the EQRRAA or ESSRAL sequences and compared to scrambled control peptide by using an enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay method. Significantly elevated levels of IgG and IgM antibodies to P. mirabilis and antibodies against both EQRRAA and ESSRAL peptides were detected in sera of Finnish patients with early and advanced RA, and in Japanese patients from Otsu or Tokyo compared to their corresponding control groups. In contrast, no difference either in the total or in any of the isotypic antibodies were observed between these groups when serum samples were screened against each of E. coli and S. marcescens or against the control peptide. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the antibody levels against Proteus bacteria only and both EQRRAA and ESRRAL peptides. Our findings support the possibility for specific involvement of P. mirabilis in the etiopathogenesis of RA even in early cases.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (up to 36 h). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (UBT) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. The mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. The mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. The UBTs, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an Escherichia coli ATCC reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, MHB): E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/0.008); E. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); Klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016); Proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); Enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); Staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and S. saprophyticus Ho94 (0.125/0.25). The median UBTs measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa and between 1:8 and 1:>or=1024 for the five Gram-positive strains. The median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains (incl P. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five Gram-positive strains. The UBTs up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (P<0.05 ) for both E. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all Gram-positive strains. For the UBTs at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the Proteus and Pseudomonas strains. The areas under the UBT-time-curve (AUBT) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (P ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for P. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (Gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually Gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated UTI performed previously [Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents (2004)].
TI  - [Bacterial colonization of chronic wounds. Studies on outpatients in a university dermatology clinic with special consideration of ORSA].
AB  - In this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between January 2002 and May 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. We isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were Staphylococcus aureus, 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 Escherichia coli, 4 Proteus mirabilis, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Serratia marcescens, 2 Streptococcus group G und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. Moreover we identified one patient with Candida parapsilosis. Therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed Staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. Determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. Consequently, 30.4% of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were ORSA strains. All of the ORSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. Sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the ORSA-positive patients. In the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. Beside the obligate resistance to oxacillin, penicillin G, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the ORSA was sensitive to ofloxacin. The results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of ORSA.
TI  - Detection of anti-Proteus antibodies in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - This study was carried out to determine increased level of antibodies to certain  bacteria in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Fifty RA patients and 25 each of those suffering from osteoarthritis (OA) and healthy controls were tested for antibodies to somatic ('O) and flagellar ('H') antigens of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and for antibodies to 'O' antigen of Klebsiella pneumoniae by standard tube agglutination method. Anti-Proteus antibodies against 'O' and 'H' antigens could be demonstrated in 70% and 64% RA cases respectively, and were statistically significant. Antibodies could be demonstrated against E. coli 'O' and 'H' antigens in 86% and 92% RA cases respectively, and were statistically significant. Against K. pneumoniae 'O' antigen, no antibody could be demonstrated in any of RA and OA cases, and healthy controls. Of the 50 RA patients, 30 had raised CRP levels. Antibodies against P. mirabilis and E. coli antigens appeared to be independent from CRP. Thus a specific elevation in the immune response to P. mirabilis and E. coli has been demonstrated in patients with RA from India.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the Taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (TSAR) program, 2000.
AB  - In a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (Taiwan Surveillance of  Antimicrobial Resistance, TSAR), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (TSAR II). This report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) in the TSAR II collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (TSAR I) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. Resistance of the 5 Enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in Taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in E. coli, 68% in P. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in K. pneumonia to 66% in S. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in K. pneumoniae to 70% in P. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. Resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in Taiwan than most Western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant A. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli (12%). Differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in TSAR II; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout Taiwan.
TI  - Current issues in the management of urinary tract infections: extended-release ciprofloxacin as a novel treatment option.
AB  - Symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a major public health concern in  the developed world, accounting for almost 8 million annual outpatient and emergency department visits in the US alone, while also representing one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. The vast majority of uncomplicated UTIs are caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Escherichia coli, with other pathogens including enterococci, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis. Effective management of UTIs in both the inpatient and outpatient settings has been complicated by the fact that many uropathogenic strains have developed resistance to antimicrobials, including cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs in the US and many other countries. In some countries, other antimicrobial therapies, such as trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin, are also used for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Antimicrobial resistance has been associated with an increased rate of clinical failure, and reports from Canada and the US indicate that the prevalence of cotrimoxazole resistance exceeds 15% and can be as high as 25%.The emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance can be reduced with the use of agents that have favourable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and convenient dose administration regimens that facilitate patient adherence and, therefore, pathogen eradication. Fluoroquinolones have been used successfully to treat a wide range of community- and hospital-acquired infections, and the rates of fluoroquinolone resistance have remained low. Use of fluoroquinolones is recommended for uncomplicated UTIs in areas where the incidence of cotrimoxazole resistance exceeds 10%, as well as for the treatment of complicated UTIs and acute pyelonephritis. Ciprofloxacin is a widely used fluoroquinolone with high bactericidal activity against uropathogens and well established clinical efficacy in the treatment of UTIs. A new, extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin (Cipro XR) provides systemic drug exposure comparable with that achieved with twice-daily administration of conventional, immediate-release ciprofloxacin, while also attaining higher maximum plasma concentrations with less interpatient variability. Therapeutic drug concentrations with extended-release ciprofloxacin are established immediately after dose administration and maintained throughout the 24-hour dosage interval, permitting convenient, once-daily treatment. Clinical trial results confirm that extended-release ciprofloxacin is as safely used and effective as the conventional, immediate-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in patients with uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. These findings support the use of extended-release ciprofloxacin as a well tolerated, effective and convenient therapy for UTIs, which may improve patients' adherence to therapy and, thereby, reduce the risk of infection recurrence and emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - Longitudinal trends in fluoroquinolone resistance among Enterobacteriaceae isolates from inpatients and outpatients, 1989-2000: differences in the emergence and epidemiology of resistance across organisms.
AB  - We conducted a 12-year study to identify and compare trends in annual prevalence  of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance among Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from inpatients and outpatients in our health care system. A total of 46,070 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates underwent susceptibility testing. Although there were significant increases in inpatient FQ resistance for all Enterobacteriaceae, FQ resistance trends differed significantly across Enterobacteriaceae (P<.001). For isolates obtained from outpatients, only Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis demonstrated significant increases in FQ resistance (P<.001 for each). Trends in outpatient FQ resistance also differed significantly across Enterobacteriaceae (P<.001). There were significant differences between inpatient and outpatient FQ resistance trends for all Enterobacteriaceae except P. mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. Although hospital-wide use of certain antibiotics correlated significantly with inpatient FQ resistance, these correlations differed substantially across organisms. Efforts to elucidate the epidemiology of FQ resistance and identify targets for intervention must recognize and account for the variability of FQ resistance across organisms and clinical settings.
TI  - [Catheter-related urinary infections at the Clinical Center in Banja Luka].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infections of the urinary tract, and among the most common nosocomial infections in general. The major problems of these infections include antibiotic resistance and enormous direct and indirect cost of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study on major causes of infections and antibiotic resistance was conducted at four clinics of the Clinical Center of Banja Luka. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to nursing staff dealing with urinary catheters in order to get an overview of their clinical performance. RESULTS: The results showed that in 89% of cases (out of 198 patients with developed catheter-associated urinary tract infection) infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria, in 7% by gram-positive bacteria and in 4% by candida. The most common bacteria were: Escherichia coli (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.1%), Proteus mirabilis (13.3%), and Enterobacter (10.5%). Majority of bacteria presented with extremely high resistance (72-100%) to ampicillin, gentamycin and cotrimoxazole, and in some cases a significant resistance to ciproflaxacine, nalidixic acid, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. The questionnaire showed that nursing staff did not follow guidelines for medical care of patients with urinary catheters. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that poor hygienic and epidemiological conditions, as well as irrational use of antibiotics contribute to uncontrolled development of urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.
TI  - Results from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme: report of the 2001 data from 15 United States medical centres.
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme is an international surveillance network of more than 100 medical centres where meropenem is the primary therapeutic carbapenem. Institutions have been monitored since 1997 (1999 in United States (US)) using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference susceptibility methods to monitor in vitro activity of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. In 2001, a total of 2874 strains were processed from the 15 US medical centres. Molecular methods were associated with MIC methods as needed for defining epidemic spread of resistant strains. The meropenem MIC(90) values were 0.03 mg/l for Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.; 0.06 mg/l for Proteus mirabilis and Serratia spp. and 0.12 mg/l for Enterobacter spp. This potency was 8-16-fold greater than that of imipenem and the meropenem spectrum of activity versus the Enterobacteriaceae was the broadest of all tested antimicrobial agents. Only piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC(9), 64 mg/l) and tobramycin (MIC(90), 4 mg/l) were active against more than 90.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the NCCLS susceptible breakpoint, and the carbapenems were the most active compounds against Acinetobacter spp. However, Acinetobacter spp. isolates were resistant to all of the antimicrobial agents tested and the molecular typing results suggested that they were epidemiologically related. Only ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime had significantly reduced activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (87.9-92.6% susceptible. These 2001 US MYSTIC Programme results demonstrated no significant decline in carbapenem activity or susceptibility rates compared with the previously monitored years (1999-2000). Most apparent were the decreasing susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime against staphylococci. Continued surveillance in these institutions appears warranted as sites of high potential emerging resistance risk.
TI  - Cephalosporin resistant urinary tract infections in young children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the antibiotic resistance pattern of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (UTI) in a cohort of Australian children under 6 years of age. METHODS: Data were collected over a 12-month period from children under 6 years of age with a provisional diagnosis of UTI made in the Emergency Department of Sunshine Hospital, Victoria. RESULTS: During the study period 100 culture-proven UTI were identified in 97 children. Three children had two episodes. Out of the 100 episodes, 39% were male, 56% were under 12 months of age at presentation and 61% were managed as outpatients. Clinical features were non-specific in the majority of cases. Hydronephrosis and vesicoureteric reflux was detected in 5.5% and 28.6%, respectively, of children with their first investigated UTI. A single bacterial isolate was cultured from 97 urines and two from three samples. Escherichia coli (n = 90) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 5) were the most common isolates. In vitro resistance to ampicillin/amoxycillin was found in 52% of isolates, to trimethoprim in 14% and to cephalothin/cephalexin in 24%. This resistance rate to first generation cephalosporins is the highest reported to date in adult or paediatric UTI in Australia. CONCLUSIONS: Ampicillin/amoxycillin or cephalothin/cephalexin may not be the optimal choice of antibiotic for the empiric treatment of UTI in this and possibly other paediatric populations.
TI  - Adaptation to extreme environments: macromolecular dynamics in bacteria compared  in vivo by neutron scattering.
AB  - Mean macromolecular dynamics was quantified in vivo by neutron scattering in psychrophile, mesophile, thermophile and hyperthermophile bacteria. Root mean square atomic fluctuation amplitudes determining macromolecular flexibility were found to be similar for each organism at its physiological temperature ( approximately 1 A in the 0.1 ns timescale). Effective force constants determining the mean macromolecular resilience were found to increase with physiological temperature from 0.2 N/m for the psychrophiles, which grow at 4 degrees C, to 0.6 N/m for the hyperthermophiles (85 degrees C), indicating that the increase in stabilization free energy is dominated by enthalpic rather than entropic terms. Larger resilience allows macromolecular stability at high temperatures, while maintaining flexibility within acceptable limits for biological activity.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Relationship between fluoroquinolone use and changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones of selected pathogens in 10 United States teaching hospitals, 1991-2000.
AB  - We retrospectively examined the relationship between fluoroquinolone use and the  susceptibilities of 11 bacterial pathogens to fluoroquinolones in 10 US teaching hospitals from 1991 through 2000. Statistical significance was determined by 2-way analysis of variance, with the number of isolates tested each year as a weighting factor. The analysis of baseline-to-end point change in the percentage of susceptibility and the slope of the regression line (trend line) for logit percentage of susceptibility showed that the overall percentage of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones decreased significantly during the study period (P<.05) and that change in percentage of susceptibility was significantly related to change in fluoroquinolone use (P<.05). Particularly notable were the decreases in the susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli (decreases of 25.1%, 11.9%, and 6.8%, respectively).
TI  - Differential regulation of the Proteus mirabilis urease gene cluster by UreR and  H-NS.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, relies on several virulence factors to colonize the urinary tract. Among these, urease contributes to the development of urinary stones resulting from the increase in local pH due to urease-mediated hydrolysis of urea to NH(3) and CO(2). UreR, an AraC-like transcriptional activator, activates transcription of the genes encoding the urease subunits and accessory proteins (ureDABCEFG) in the presence of urea. UreR also initiates transcription of its own gene in a urea-inducible manner by binding to the intergenic region between ureR and ureD. The intergenic region contains poly(A) tracts that appear to be the target of H-NS. It has been shown that Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis H-NS acts to repress transcription of ureR in an E. coli model system. It was hypothesized that H-NS represses urease gene expression in the absence of UreR and urea by binding to the intergenic region. To demonstrate this the P. mirabilis hns gene was cloned and the 15.6 kDa H-NS was overexpressed and purified as a myc-His tail fusion. Using a gel shift assay, purified H-NS-myc-His bound preferentially to a 609 bp DNA fragment containing the entire ureR-ureD intergenic region. H-NS and UreR were able to displace each other from the ureR-ureD intergenic region. Circular permutation analysis revealed that the intergenic region is bent. Moreover, H-NS recognizes this curvature, binds the DNA fragment and induces further bending of the DNA as shown by a circular ligation assay. The effects of H-NS, urea and temperature (25 vs 37 degrees C) on urease expression were shown in E. coli containing an hns knockout and P. mirabilis where expression was increased at 37 degrees C. Increased transcription from p(ureR) was seen in the E. coli hns knockout when temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees C. These findings suggest H-NS and UreR differentially regulate urease in a negative and positive manner, respectively.
TI  - Vesical calculi with unrepaired vesicovaginal fistula: a clinical appraisal of an uncommon association.
AB  - PURPOSE: Primary vesical calculi are uncommon in patients with vesicovaginal fistula (VVF). We retrospectively analyzed 19 such cases and present our experience with the management of this condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 2002, 19 patients were treated for this association. All patients provided a history and underwent physical examination, metabolic evaluation for stone disease, urine culture test and cystovaginoscopic examination. They were treated with a staged procedure with the fistula repaired 2 to 3 months after stone removal. RESULTS: VVF was a result of obstructed labor in all cases. The patients presented a mean of 28.8 months after fistula formation. No metabolic abnormality was detected in any patient. Urine culture was positive for Proteus mirabilis in 6 and Escherichia coli in 5, and it yielded mixed growth in 8. All women had some residual urine in the bladder (mean 11 ml). The fistula was located supratrigonally in 13 cases, while it was high trigonal in the remainder. A total of 17 patients were treated endoscopically by cystolitholapexy or fragmentation of the stone by transurethral cystolithotripsy using a Lithoclast (Microvasive Urology, Natick, Massachusetts). Two patients required open suprapubic cystolithotomy. All patients underwent fistula repair 3 months after stone removal with successful results in 16. CONCLUSIONS: Primary vesical calculi in patients with VVF are associated with urinary contamination, a high or supratrigonal fistula location, residual urine in the bladder and a long history of disease. Staged management of the problem showed good results.
TI  - Argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in Argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 Argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period November 2001-March 2002. Out of 418 Enterobacteriaceae included in the Study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBLs putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of Proteus mirabilis and 25% Escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as ESBLs producers Notably P.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for ESBL producers. ESBLs producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. The isolates considered as amp C beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. Noteworthy only 4% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (MIC(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against Acinetobacter spp (MIC(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). Only 41.7% Acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates (MIC(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. The activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). Out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as E.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 E.faecium and 1 E.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. All the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). Regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed MICs of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. Among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (MIC(90) 4 microg/ml).Piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (IE: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in Argentina. Caution must be taken for infections due to ESBL producers considering that the inoculum effect MICs can affect MIC values.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in institutionalized elderly patients. Incidence of bacterial resistance and risk factors].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The goal of the present work was to study urinary tract infections  (UTI) in a sociosanitary center in order to characterize etiology, define sensitivity profiles, and study associations between these profiles and various clinical parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study of all urinary tract infections at the caring unit of a geriatric sociosanitary center was carried out. Antibiograms were performed on all patients in which a UTI was suspected, and the association between the isolated organism or E. coli resistance with various clinical parameters (gender, bed confinement, recurrence, incontinence, neural impairment, basic daily life activities and drug use) was studied using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are the most commonly isolated organisms (51% and 15%, respectively). The former is associated with bed confinement and the female gender. The latter shows an inverse relation with recurrence in 90 days. Resistance to the antibiotics studied correlates with a number of clinical parameters, although associations vary for each antimicrobial agent. Previous use of antibiotics and recurrence of infection have no influence on resistance. DISCUSSION: Geriatric patients' characteristics may well account for some of the results encountered. However, the development of resistance in the center may be related to spreading from direct contact between patients. The relationship between resistance and drug use may be affected by the external administration, rather than in-center administration, of drugs.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  - In 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the Aquitaine region in France produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Among these were 19 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 Escherichia coli isolates; 3 Proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Providencia stuartii. ESBL producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes and 5 ambulatory patients. Seven different ESBLs were characterized. These mainly consisted of TEM-24 (25 isolates) and TEM-21 (9 isolates), but TEM-15 (2 isolates) and TEM-3, TEM-19, SHV-4, and CTX-M-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. Seven strains showed the coexistence of different TEM- and/or SHV-encoding genes, including a new SHV-1 variant, SHV-44, defined by the substitution R205L previously reported for SHV-3 in association with S238G. The epidemiology of the ESBL producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the ESBL, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the ESBL-encoding plasmids. Of the TEM-24-expressing strains, 18 were E. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in France. Of the TEM-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. Outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. The presence of ESBL producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. Our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in general practice.
TI  - Comparison of two test methods for the determination of sufficient antimicrobial  activity of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs for hygienic hand disinfection.
AB  - In Europe, the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs is determined with a quantitative suspension test (prEN 12054) and a test under practical conditions (EN 1500). Another test method has recently been published by the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (DGHM) with four differences to the European system in the in vitro tests: additional qualitative suspension tests with product dilutions to the ineffective range; a selection of the most resistant Gram-negative test strains in the qualitative suspension test, which should be used adjacent to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the quantitative suspension test; a high organic load in the quantitative suspension tests (0.3% albumin and 0.3% sheep erythrocytes); and an aqueous control in the quantitative suspension test. According to DGHM, the in vitro tests should be followed by EN 1500. We have determined the antimicrobial efficacy of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs according to both methods. prEN 12054 was carried out without organic load. The qualitative suspension tests (DGHM) were carried out with P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae and Candida albicans. The quantitative suspension test (DGHM) was carried out with product dilutions of 75%, 50% and 25%, and a high organic load using the following test organisms: P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis (one product only), S. aureus, E. hirae and C. albicans. All these suspension tests were carried out in quadruplicate with each product and exposure time. EN 1500 was carried out with 3 mL of each product and an application time of 30 s. All three products achieved the required bactericidal activity of prEN 12054 and the new DGHM method within 30 s, and were equally effective with the reference hand disinfection of EN 1500 within 30 s. In our study, the DGHM test method did not provide additional information for hand rubs which exhibit their bactericidal efficacy with 3 mL within 30 s (EN 1500).
TI  - Susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. We created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 January, 1990 through 31 December, 2000). Improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. During the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). The mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). The 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: Escherichia coli (1494), Staphylococcus aureus (1240), Klebsiella pneumoniae (779), Enterococcus spp. (631), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), Streptococcus pneumoniae (447), Enterobacter spp. (338), Acinetobacter spp. (298), Proteus mirabilis (260) and Candida spp. (254). No significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was E. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was Candida (1, 0.3). Forty percent of organisms (N=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ED), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (ICUs). Trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ED Enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the ICU isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. The difference in susceptibility between ED and ICU isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (P<0.001). A significant decrease in the susceptibility of E coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. In K. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of K. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. Pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. Susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (P<0.001). Marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. Trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
TI  - Development of a PCR assay for detection of Enterobacteriaceae in foods.
AB  - A broad-range PCR assay for the detection of bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family was developed in this study. Primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were newly designed and used in this PCR assay. To determine the specificity of the assay, 72 different bacterial species (of 49 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. Results were positive for every tested Vibrioaceae or Enterobacteriaceae strain except Proteus mirabilis. For all other bacterial strains and eukaryotes tested, results were negative. Bacterial DNA for PCR was prepared by a simple procedure with the use of Chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in brain heart infusion medium. To test this PCR assay for the monitoring of the Enterobacteriaceae family, either Escherichia coli or Salmonella Enteritidis was inoculated into various foods as an indicator. Prior to the PCR, the inoculation of 10 to 40 CFU of bacteria per g of food was followed by a 5-h enrichment culture step, and the PCR assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. When actual examinations of the contamination of 15 noodle foods with Enterobacteriaceae by this PCR assay were conducted, 33% (5 of 15) of the samples tested positive. These results agreed with those of the Petrifilm Enterobacteriaceae Count Plate assay. Including the enrichment culture step, the entire PCR detection process can be completed within 7 h.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in South Croatia: aetiology and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of uropathogens isolated  from outpatients living in South Croatia and the in vitro susceptibility of these organisms to antimicrobial agents. Of 5080 enrolled uropathogen isolates, 82.28% isolates were Gram-negative, the most frequent isolates being Escherichia coli (62.62%), enterococci (10.18%), Proteus mirabilis (5.31%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.84%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.70%), Pseudomonas spp. (3.46%), Klebsiella spp. (2.38%). The E. coli resistance rate was 42.17% to amoxycillin, 20.59% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and 6.09% to norfloxacin. Almost all Klebsiella spp. isolates were resistant to amoxycillin and the resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was over 20%, and 14.15% to the fluoroquinolones. A high methicillin-resistance rate was found among S. aureus (61.22%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (41.48).
TI  - In vitro activity of fosfomycin against gram-negative urinary pathogens and the biological cost of fosfomycin resistance.
AB  - The aim of this study was to reassess the activity of fosfomycin against recently isolated uropathogens circulating in Italy and to evaluate the effect of fosfomycin resistance on the expression of several virulence traits using the rare mutant strains. In vitro activity of fosfomycin was evaluated using 441 Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Fosfomycin was the most active antibiotic against Escherichia coli (99% susceptibility). The activity against Proteus mirabilis was more potent than that of co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin (87.5, 67 and 0% susceptibility, respectively). The other microorganisms, accounting for about 7% of all pathogens tested, showed variable susceptibilities to fosfomycin. Compared with susceptible strains, fosfomycin-resistant mutants showed a reduced rate of growth and were impaired in their ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells and to urinary catheters. They were also more resistant to UV irradiation and to phage T7 and showed diminished rates of colicin synthesis and transfer of plasmids.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four European countries, Canada, and the United States in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  - Access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. The present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), Canada, and the United States to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. All but two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of Proteus mirabilis from France and one isolate of Morganella morganii from Canada) were susceptible to imipenem. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for P. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except Italy. In contrast, susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (Spain) to 94.0% (France); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (Spain) to 91.6% (United States). Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. Considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of Serratia marcescens and M. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. For S. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (France) to 94.1% (Italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (Germany) to 90.7% (Spain). Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of Enterobacteriaceae studied. The present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The XerC recombinase of Proteus mirabilis: characterization and interaction with  other tyrosine recombinases.
AB  - XerC and XerD are two site-specific recombinases, which act on different sites to maintain replicons in a monomeric state. This system, which was first discovered and studied in Escherichia coli, is present in several species including Proteus mirabilis, where the XerD recombinase was previously characterized by our laboratory. In this paper, we report the presence of the xerC gene in P. mirabilis. Using in vitro reactions, we show that the two P. mirabilis recombinases display binding and cleavage activity on the E. coli dif site and the ColE1 cer site, together or in collaboration with E. coli recombinases. In vivo, P. mirabilis XerC and XerD are able to resolve and monomerize a plasmid containing two cer sites, increasing its stability. However, P. mirabilis XerC, in combination with E. coli XerD, is unable to perform these functions.
TI  - Multiple CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in nosocomial isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from a hospital in northern Italy.
AB  - Twelve isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (1 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Proteus mirabilis, and 2 of Proteus vulgaris) classified as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers according to the ESBL screen flow application of the BD-Phoenix automatic system and for which the cefotaxime MICs were higher than those of ceftazidime were collected between January 2001 and July 2002 at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology of the San Matteo University Hospital of Pavia (northern Italy). By PCR and sequencing, a CTX-M-type determinant was detected in six isolates, including three of E. coli (carrying bla(CTX-M-1)), two of P. vulgaris (carrying bla(CTX-M-2)), and one of K. pneumoniae (carrying bla(CTX-M-15)). The three CTX-M-1-producing E. coli isolates were from different wards, and genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that they were clonally unrelated to each other. The two CTX-M-2-producing P. vulgaris isolates were from the same ward (although isolated several months apart), and PFGE analysis revealed probable clonal relatedness. The bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CTX-M-2) determinants were transferable to E. coli by conjugation, while conjugative transfer of the bla(CTX-M-15) determinant from K. pneumoniae was not detectable. Present findings indicate that CTX-M enzymes of various types are present also in Italy and underscore that different CTX-M determinants can be found in a single hospital and can show different dissemination patterns. This is also the first report of CTX-M-2 in P. vulgaris.
TI  - Morphological, host range, and genetic characterization of two coliphages.
AB  - Two coliphages, AR1 and LG1, were characterized based on their morphological, host range, and genetic properties. Transmission electron microscopy showed that both phages belonged to the Myoviridae; phage particles of LG1 were smaller than those of AR1 and had an isometric head 68 nm in diameter and a complex contractile tail 111 nm in length. Transmission electron micrographs of AR1 showed phage particles consisting of an elongated isometric head of 103 by 74 nm and a complex contractile tail 116 nm in length. Both phages were extensively tested on many strains of Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria. The results showed that both phages could infect many serotypes of E. coli. Among the enterobacteria, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella dysenteriae, and two Salmonella strains were lysed by the phages. The genetic material of AR1 and LG1 was characterized. Phage LG1 had a genome size of 49.5 kb compared to 150 kb for AR1. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that several restriction enzymes could degrade DNA from both phages. The morphological, genome size, and restriction endonuclease similarities between AR1 and phage T4 were striking. Southern hybridizations showed that AR1 and T4 are genetically related. The wide host ranges of phages AR1 and LG1 suggest that they may be useful as biocontrol, therapeutic, or diagnostic agents to control and detect the prevalence of E. coli in animals and food.
TI  - The effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid in microbial adherence in vitro.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the in vitro effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid (lower than normal plasma levels), on the adherence of five microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) of healthy volunteers. The study reached the following conclusions: 1) the presence of ascorbic acid significantly reduces the ability of all tested strains (with the exception of Klebsiella pneumoniae) to adhere to BEC; 2) ascorbic acid interacts with the epithelial cells and decreases the adherence of all tested microorganisms. These findings may be of potential clinical significance.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in Buenos Aires, Argentina, public hospitals.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). In order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of ESBLs in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from April to May 2000. Extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. From a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' Screening and Confirmatory Tests for ESBL production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-Lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and PCR amplification using specific primers. Three different ESBLs were detected: SHV-related (4 isolates), PER-2-type (9 isolates), and CTX-M-2-related (26 isolates). Sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed CTX-M-2 in 19 of 21 and CTX-M-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. CTX-M-2 (or its variant) was detected in all Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii strains, while PER-2 was detected in Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; SHV-related ESBL were found only in K. pneumoniae. These results clearly show that CTX-M-2 is the most prevalent ESBL produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in Buenos Aires.
TI  - Trends in fluoroquinolone resistance of bacteria isolated from canine urinary tracts.
AB  - Fluoroquinolone (FQ) antimicrobial agents are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine. Widespread use of any antimicrobial agent can apply selective pressure on populations of bacteria, which may result in an increase in the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates. Antimicrobial-susceptibility data on bacteria isolated from the canine urinary tract by the University of Missouri-Columbia Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Columbia, MO, were used to determine whether there has been an increase in the prevalence of FQ-resistant bacteria over time. Between January 1992 and December 2001, minimum inhibitory concentrations of either ciprofloxacin (1992-1998) or enrofloxacin (1998-2001) were determined for 1,478 bacterial isolates from the canine urinary tract. The predominant bacterial species isolated were Escherichia coli (547 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (156), and Staphylococcus intermedius (147). In all, there were 13 bacterial species with more than 25 isolates each. A significant increase in the overall proportion of resistant bacterial isolates was documented from 1992 to 2001 (Cochran-Armitage test for trend, P < 0.0001). The same increase in resistant isolates was documented when either ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin was analyzed separately (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0002, respectively). No difference was detected in rates of bacterial FQ resistance with regard to the sex of the dog from which the bacteria were isolated. The frequency with which some bacterial species were isolated differed with the sex of the infected dog. Proteus mirabilis was found more often in females (P < 0.0001), whereas beta hemolytic Streptococcus spp., were found more often in males (P = 0.0003). Although the overall efficacy of FQ antimicrobials remained high with greater than 80% of isolates being susceptible, the data demonstrated an increase in the proportion of resistant bacteria isolated from the urinary tract of the dog.
TI  - Chloride dependence of growth in bacteria.
AB  - Chloride is an abundant anion on earth but studies analyzing a possible function  of chloride in prokaryotes are scarce. To address the question, we have tested 44 different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for a chloride dependence or chloride stimulation of growth. None required chloride for growth at their optimal growth (salt) conditions. However, in hyperosmotic media containing high concentrations of Na+, 11 bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Paracoccus denitrificans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Thermus thermophilus, and Vibrio fischeri) had a strict chloride dependence for growth or were significantly stimulated by chloride. These data show that chloride is essential for growth at high salt (Na+) concentrations in various species of the domain Bacteria.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Chronic inflammatory state and chronic infections appear to be one of the most important risk factors of morbidity and mortality in patients (pts) on dialysis. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of urinary tract infections (UTI) in clinically asymptomatic patients on CAPD. The study included 43 (22F, 21M) clinically stable asymptomatic CAPD patients with diuresis ranged from 300 to 2500 ml per 24 h. Clean catch urine specimen, was cultured and identified by standard technique. Urine from 31 patients had no significant organism growth, from 12 patients grew over 100,000 colonies per ml; 8 patients had been infected with E. coli, 2 pts with Proteus mirabilis, one with Enterococcus gallinarum, one with Klebsiella oxytocea. 7/12 infected pts were diabetic, 67% infected and 13% not infected pts had pyuria. CONCLUSIONS: Immune system disturbance and renal failure can predispose to common asymptomatic UTI in CAPD pts. E. coli is the most common bacterial strain found in infected dialysis pts. Diabetes mellitus is and additional predisposing factor for UTI in patients on CAPD. Pyuria is a valuable parameter of UTI in CAPD patients.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Candida--agent of the diaper dermatitis?
AB  - Occurrence of Candida spp. was determined in a population of 60 infants, 1-15-month-old, with diaper dermatitis, admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit in Hospital Saca (Kosice, Slovakia). Specimens were obtained from the perianal, pubic, inguinal, or gluteal areas that showed signs of secondary infection as manifested by erythema, oozing, vesiculopustular lesions, and pus formation. The most frequently isolated species was C. albicans (41), followed by C. parapsilosis (8), C. tropicalis (4), C. pulcherrima (4), C. guilliermondii (2), and C. zeylanoides (1). Other organisms present in the mixed culture from the diaper area were Staphylococcus aureus (6), Escherichia coli (3), and 2 strains of each group B and D streptococci, and Proteus mirabilis. Infants diapered exclusively in disposable diapers showed less rash than those diapered exclusively or sometimes in cloth diapers.
TI  - [Pediatric vesical lithiasis. 70 case reports].
AB  - The study focuses on 70 vesicals lithiasis, with a sample consisting of 60 boys (86%) and ten girls (14%). The age varies from one year to 14 years. The revealing signs are dominated by mictional troubles in 47 cases (67%), macroscopic hematurie in 26 cases (37%), the pyurie in 12 cases (17%) and acute retention of urine in 7 cases (10%). The most frequent germs are the staphylococcus aureus with 28% of cases, the proteus mirabilis with 24% of cases and the Echerichia coli with 24% of the cases. Associated malformations were observed in 9% of the cases. The treatment was essentially surgical (99%). The evolution was simple in 97% of the cases.
TI  - Enhanced microbial biomass assay using mutant luciferase resistant to benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - In a biomass assay based on adenosine 5(')-triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence, extracellular ATP is removed; then intracellular ATP is extracted from the microorganism by an ATP extractant and subsequently reacted with luciferase. To provide a highly sensitive assay, the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in the ATP extractant was optimized by using a mutant luciferase resistant to BAC. The use of 0.2% BAC, which was acceptable for the luciferase, simultaneously achieved the maximum extraction of intracellular ATP from microorganisms and the inactivation of the ATP-eliminating enzymes for removal of extracellular ATP. The detection limit (blank+3 SD) for ATP was 1.8x10(-14)M (1.8x10(-18)mol/assay) in the presence of the ATP extractant with coefficients of variation of 0.7 to 6.3%. The reagent system coupled with the ATP-eliminating enzymes allowed for the detection of 93 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 170CFU/ml of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 170CFU/ml of Proteus mirabilis ATCC 29906, 68CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and 7.7CFU/ml of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051. The yeast cell of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 10217 could be detected at 1CFU/ml. With 54 kinds of microorganisms, the average ATP extraction efficiency compared to the trichloroacetic acid extraction method was 81.0% in 24 strains among gram-negative bacteria, 99.4% in 13 strains among gram-positive bacteria, and 97.0% in 17 strains among yeast. The ATP contents of the gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts ranged from 0.40 to 2.70x10(-18)mol/CFU (mean=1.5x10(-18)mol/CFU), from 0.41 to 16.7x10(-18)mol/CFU (mean=5.5x10(-18)mol/CFU), and from 0.714 to 54.6x10(-16)mol/CFU (mean=8.00x10(-16)mol/CFU), respectively.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamase producing multidrug resistant strains of Klebsiella spp. & Escherichia coli isolated from children under five in Chennai.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: AmpC beta-lactamases are Group I cephalosporinases that  confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs. Plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases has been discovered most frequently in isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Salmonella, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. The present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of multidrug resistant and AmpC beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli in children less than five years of age as this age group is very susceptible to intestinal and extraintestinal infections. METHODS: A total of 116 isolates of Klebsiella species and 32 isolates of Esch. coli were tested for resistance to cephamycin such as cefoxitin, third generation cephalosporin (3GC) antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), ampicillin, amikacin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, co-trimoxazole, gentamycin, imipenem and tetracycline by disc diffusion method. Isolates found resistant to cefoxitin were tested for the production of AmpC beta-lactamases by three dimensional extract method. Transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and AmpC beta lactamase production from AmpC producing Klebsiella and Esch. coli isolates to a recipient Esch. coli strain (K12 J62-2). RESULTS: Twenty eight isolates (24.1%) of Klebsiella spp. and 12 (37.5%) of Esch. coli were found to be AmpC beta-lactamase producers; 66.6 per cent and 81 per cent of Klebsiella and Esch. coli isolates respectively showed resistance to all the 3GCs. All the strains were found to be sensitive to imipenem. Eighty four (72%) of Klebsiella isolates and 20 (62.5%) of Esch. coli were found to be resistant to cefoxitin. Transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain was observed in all the AmpC producing strains of Klebsiella spp. Of the 12 AmpC producing strains of Esch. coli, only 4 (33.3%) showed the transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This study has shown the occurrence of AmpC beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella and Esch. coli strains in children in Chennai. Since AmpC beta-lactamase production is frequently accompanied by multiresistance to antibiotics, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of Klebsiella and Esch. coli infections. Also failure to identify AmpC beta-lactamase producers may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and may result in increased mortality. Detecting plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamase producing strains is technically difficult and the phenotypic tests for AmpC detection are not well defined. If an investigational AmpC beta-lactamase inhibitor was made available for diagnostic testing, it could be useful in combination with a suitable cephamycin to confirm AmpC production.
TI  - Antiviral activity of N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of Lactarius sesquiterpenoid alcohols in vitro.
AB  - Cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties of a new, originally synthesised group of compounds: the N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of sesquiterpenoid alcohols - derivatives of taxol and various sesquiterpenes of Lactarius origin were evaluated in vitro. Among 16 compounds tested, 6 decreased HSV-1 titres. Selectivity indices ranged from 13.9 to 31.7. No activity against RNA viruses (parainfluenza 3, Coxsackie B3, vesicular stomatitis virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus), bacteria: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis and fungal strain of Candida albicans was detected.
TI  - Real-time PCR duplex assay for Rickettsia prowazekii and Borrelia recurrentis.
AB  - Rickettsia prowazekii, the etiologic agent for epidemic typhus, and Borrelia recurrentis, the etiologic agent of relapsing fever, both utilize the same vector, the human body louse (Pediculus humanus), to transmit human disease. We have developed an assay to detect both bacterial pathogens in a single tube utilizing real-time PCR. Assays for both agents are specific. The R. prowazekii and B. recurrentis assays do not detect nucleic acid from R. typhi, R. canada, or any of eight spotted fever rickettsiae. In addition they did not react with Neorickettsia risticii, N. sennetsu, Franciscella persica, Bartonella quintana, Legionella pneumophila, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the B. recurrentis assay did not detect B. duttonii, B. coriaceae, B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. hermsii, or B. burgdorferi nucleic acid. Both assays detected repeatedly only R. prowazekii or B. recurrentis either when tested alone or together in one test tube.
TI  - The influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome. METHODS: From June 1995 to January 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant ICU-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. We defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the SPSS package (9.0). RESULTS: Among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In this last group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. Bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. Eleven percent developed septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%), respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (4.5% each). The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.10-6.21; P = 0.015). The global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (P = 0.04; OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12-0.97). Septic shock was related to attributable mortality (P = 0.03; OR = 3.19; 95% CI: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (P = 0.24; OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.66-4.78). CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. This fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently isolated and the source of the bacteremia.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. We assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in UK and Ireland. Standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. For quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for MIC tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. Compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. These changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of S. aureus-reflected the massive increase of MRSA, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. Based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of P. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of Enterococcus faecalis. Resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in E. coli from 4 to 10%, Klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in AmpC-inducible Enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa. MIC tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in Enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the E. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. This situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. Thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that MIC be determined with, e.g., an Etest.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns among urine isolates from patients in a geriatric hospital and from older patients in a general hospital in Jerusalem.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: Urinary tract infection is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in patients hospitalized in chronic care facilities. The changing spectrum of microorganisms involved in urinary tract infections and the emerging resistance require continuous monitoring to provide crucial information to guide empirical therapy and encourage prudent use of antibiotics. The aim of this survey was to assess the antimicrobial resistance profile of urine isolates from patients hospitalized in a geriatric hospital and from elderly patients hospitalized in an acute care hospital in order to guide empirical therapy of urinary tract infections. METHODS: The survey was performed in two hospitals in Jerusalem: a university-affiliated geriatric hospital- Herzog -and an acute secondary- and tertiary-care university hospital- Hadassah. We performed a retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance of all positive urine cultures obtained from patients in the geriatric division of Herzog Hospital and from patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized in the Internal Medicine departments in Hadassah Hospital during a 1-year period. RESULTS: The most common bacteria isolated from urine specimens in Herzog Hospital were, in order of frequency, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrated a high rate of antimicrobial resistance of those bacteria in both hospitals. The pattern we observed necessitates recommending ceftazidime as the most appropriate empirical therapy for urinary tract infection in Herzog Hospital. In Hadassah Hospital we recommend cefuroxime for those patients in good general condition and ceftazidime for those who present with clinical sepsis. Antimicrobial resistance patterns should be assessed periodically and recommendations modified accordingly. Infection control guidelines should be implemented in order to try to decrease the rate of antimicrobial resistance. Further research is requested to assess the efficacy of such interventions in long-term care facilities.
TI  - Bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from Centaurium erythraea.
AB  - As part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from Scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurium erythraea Rafn (Family: Gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative HPLC coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by UV, FABMS and extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. Antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. Both compounds inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. While swertiamarin was also active against Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the LD50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. Chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family Gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.
TI  - Pharmacological profile of extracts of Pelargonium sidoides and their constituents.
AB  - In areas of southern Africa, aqueous extracts from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides are employed to cure various disorders. Nowadays, a modern formulation (EPs 7630), elaborated from the traditional herbal medicine, is successfully used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases. We previously observed that root extracts of P. sidoides and their representative constituents exhibit moderate antibacterial and significant immunomodulatory capabilities. The present study was performed to further assess the efficacy and mode of action for these pharmacological activities. The results indicate that P. sidoides extracts may well possess antimycobacterial activity as claimed in traditional uses. Furthermore, significant antibacterial properties against multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains as well as TNF-inducing potencies and prominent interferon-like activities in supernatants of sample-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages were observed using several functional assays. In addition, EPs 7630 stimulated the synthesis of IFN-beta in MG 63 cells as demonstrated by a specific enzyme immunoassay. For gallic acid, a characteristic constituent, evidence for the expression of iNOS and TNF-alpha transcripts in stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and, hence, activation at the transcriptional level was revealed by RT-PCR. The present results, when taken together with the recently reported pharmacological activities, provide for a rationale basis of the utilization of EPs 7630 in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae) is reported. Four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by GC and GC-MS methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus Thymus. Influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. The oils showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimuium Ty2, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria from Intensive Care Units and  Urology Services. A nationwide study in The Netherlands 1995-2000.
AB  - A nationwide 6-year surveillance of resistance in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical specimens of patients from ten Intensive Care Units and ten Urology Services was started in 1995. MICs of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin were determined by broth microdilution. Intensive Care Units had higher resistance levels of amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor and ceftazidime (P<0.005) and lower resistance levels of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole and quinolones (P<0.01) than Urology Services. Changes in MIC distributions in time and development of resistant clusters were observed for nitrofurantoin (E. coli), amoxycillin (E. coli, P. mirabilis), amoxycillin/clavulanate (E. coli) and for quinolones (E. coli). The overall resistance level of ceftazidime and gentamicin was <5%, but this fluctuated with the appearance and disappearance of resistant clones in some Intensive Care Units. Quinolone resistance among P. aeruginosa from Intensive Care Units fluctuated between 7 and 14%.
TI  - [Long-term Cefadroxil prophylaxis in children with recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose, long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in children. A prospective, randomized trial in 33 children (32 female, 1 male) aged 2-14 years (mean 8.1+/-2.8) was conducted. Children with recurrent urinary tract infections were commenced to six-month prophylaxis with cefadroxil at the dosage of 12.5-15.0 mg/kg at bedtime administered every night (group I, n=15) or alternate night (group II, n=18). Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (90.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.0%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.0%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.0%). Cefadroxil prophylaxis was effective in 80% of patients in group I and in 78% patients in group II. Reinfection occurred in 3/15 (20%) patients in-group I and in 4/18 (22.2%) patients in-group II (odds ratio--1.14; 95% confidence interval--0.16-8.3). The difference of reinfection rate between the groups was not significant (p=0.88). The rate of day- and night-time wetting in both groups before prophylaxis of urinary tract infections was high. It decreased significantly at the end of prophylactic treatment with cefadroxil (from 42.4% to 9.1% and from 39.4% to 6.1% respectively). Mild adverse reaction (nausea) was observed in 1/33 patient. In conclusion our study shows that cefadroxil is an effective, well-tolerated and safe agent in the urinary tract infections prophylaxis. Prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections in children with cefadroxil on alternate night regimen might reduce the cost of the treatment.
TI  - [Community acquired urinary tract infection among hospitalized children in northern Israel: pathogens, susceptibility patterns and urinary tract anomalies].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common diseases in children. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been demonstrated in a substantial number of young children with UTI. Empiric antibacterial therapy is recommended before results of the urine culture are available in order to shorten the duration of the disease and prevent renal complications. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence and susceptibility patterns of UTI pathogens, and urinary anomalies in children admitted with UTI. METHODS: The study population included 151 children younger than 14 years admitted with first UTI. Renal ultrasound was performed in all the patients and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in children younger than 5 years. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was performed in children with vesicoureteral reflux. The data included age, sex, symptoms and signs, urinalysis, the pathogen and its sensitivity and the results of the imaging studies. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients (79%) were females. Gram negative rods caused 98% of the infections, of which Escherichia coli (87%) was the most prevalent pathogen, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and Proteus mirabilis (4%). The sensitivities to antibacterial agents were: Amikacin 100%, ceftazidime 97%, gentamicin 96%, ceftriaxone 96%, cefuroxime 95%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 84%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 63%, cephalexin 58%, and ampicillin 28%. Renal US showed minor abnormalities in 24/149 (16%) and VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in 38/127 (30%) patients. DMSA revealed renal scars in 7/28 (25%) children with vesicoureteral reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Overall Gram negative rods cause 98% of the UTI in hospitalized children in our area. E. coli is the leading pathogen and aminoglycosides and second or third generation cephalosporins are the most suitable agents for empiric therapy in UTI. A high incidence of renal scars in young children with vesicoureteral reflux was found.
TI  - Is combination antimicrobial therapy required for urinary tract infection in children?
AB  - This retrospective study examined the characteristics of 338 pediatric patients presenting with a first episode of symptomatic urinary tract infection at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from November 1996 to December 2001. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (72.5%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Enterococcus (5.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.7%). They were more susceptible to first-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other first-line antimicrobial agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and gentamicin. Two hundred and eighty-seven (84.9%) of the 338 patients were divided into 3 groups according to the type of antibiotic treatment received, and the susceptibility rate and the averaged day of defervescence after effective antibiotic therapy were compared among the groups. Group 1 consisted of those patients treated with cefazolin or cephalexin alone (95%, 2.1 days); Group 2, cefazolin plus gentamicin (88.9%, 2.8 days); and Group 3, ampicillin plus gentamicin (76.1%, 2.3 days). A total of 38 (13.2%) cases from the 3 antibiotic groups did not respond to empiric antibiotics. For non-susceptible infections, when the antibiotic regimen was switched from cefazolin plus gentamicin to ampicillin alone, only 4 (20%) strains became susceptible, compared with 10 strains (62.5%) becoming susceptible after switching from ampicillin plus gentamicin to cefazolin alone (p < 0.01). The results indicated that first-generation cephalosporin alone is an appropriate treatment for pediatric cases of community-acquired urinary tract infection and suggest that antimicrobial combinations should be reserved for serious or critical cases.
TI  - Susceptibility patterns of orally administered antimicrobials among urinary tract infection pathogens from hospitalized patients in North America: comparison report to Europe and Latin America. Results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2000).
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) remain a worldwide nosocomial infection problem.  Geographic variations in pathogen occurrence and susceptibility profiles require monitoring to provide information to guide new (garenoxacin [BMS284756]) therapeutic options. Two thousand seven hundred-eighty UTI isolates from Europe (n = 783), Latin America (531), and North America (1,466) were tested and compared against 44 agents by reference methods in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. The top seven pathogens accounted for 90% of all isolates and the rank order for all regions was: Escherichia coli (1,316; 47%), Enterococcus spp. (351; 13%), Klebsiella spp. (306; 11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (210; 8%), Proteus mirabilis (145; 5%), Enterobacter spp. (97; 4%), and Citrobacter spp. (78; 3%). The pathogen rank order was similar among regions except for the rarer occurrence of Enterococcus spp. (Rank #6, 4%) in Latin America. E. coli ampicillin resistance was highest in Europe and Latin America (51-55%). Ampicillin (37%), ciprofloxacin or garenoxacin (4%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (23%) resistance remained lowest in North America. Nitrofurantoin susceptibility in E. coli was still at acceptable levels and ranged from 91 to 96% across regions. The regional ciprofloxacin-resistant rank order for P. aeruginosa by region was: Latin America (55%) > Europe (41%) > North America (29%). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were only detected in North America (7%). Garenoxacin possessed a 34 to 44% wider spectrum compared to ciprofloxacin against enterococci UTI isolates. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase rates for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were 4 and 19%, respectively. These results emphasized the need to assess the often striking differences in pathogen occurrence and resistance rates among the commonly encountered UTI pathogens.
TI  - Ruptured renal microaneurysms complicated with a retroperitoneal abscess for a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  - Renal artery aneurysm is extremely rare among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.(SLE). Herein, we report on a 22-year-old male lupus patient who presented with acute abdominal pain, anemia and subsequent hypertension. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a peri-renal hematoma over the right kidney. A renal angiography revealed bilateral renal microaneurysms. The patient subsequently developed a right-side retroperitoneal abscess 4 weeks after hematoma formation and received an emergent laparotomy with drainage. Subsequent culture ofthe abscess-derived fluid revealed the presence of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Following appropriate antipyretic and immunosuppressive drugs therapy, the patient recovered successfully. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SLE associated with a retro-peritoneal abscess probably secondary to a ruptured renal microaneurysm.
TI  - In vitro synergy studies using aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations against six species of Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: To evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomanas aeruginosa. RESULTS: All aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index >0.5-4] or synergy (FIC index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. Aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 P. mirabilis, 1 E. cloacae, 1 B. cepacia). Aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (P. mirabilis, E. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (E. cloacae). Aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. CONCLUSION: Additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. Synergy involving aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. Although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized patients in the United States from 1998 to 2001.
AB  - Longitudinal surveillance of Enterobacteriaceae for antimicrobial susceptibility  is important because species of this family are among the most significant and prevalent human pathogens. To estimate rates of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among hospitalized patients in the United States, data from The Surveillance Network were studied for 14 agents tested against 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 384,279) isolated from intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients and non-ICU inpatients from 1998 to 2001. Cumulative susceptibility (percent) data for all species of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from ICU patients and non-ICU inpatients, respectively, were ranked as follows: ampicillin-sulbactam (45.5 and 57.2) << ticarcillin-clavulanate (74.8 and 83.5) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (87.0 and 84.5) congruent with cefotaxime (82.9 and 92.6) = ceftazidime (82.3 and 91.0) = ceftriaxone (86.5 and 93.9) = piperacillin-tazobactam (83.5 and 90.5) < levofloxacin (89.3 and 90.6) = ciprofloxacin (91.0 and 91.7) < gentamicin (91.8 and 94.3) < cefepime (95.0 and 97.9) < amikacin (98.5 and 99.2) < imipenem (100 and 100) = meropenem (100 and 100). Of those agents studied only susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (94 to 89%) and levofloxacin (93 to 89%) decreased in a stepwise manner from 1998 to 2001. Decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility was most pronounced for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae. For all species of Enterobacteriaceae, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was more commonly observed in isolates with a single-drug resistance phenotype while gentamicin and fluoroquinolone resistances were more common in isolates resistant to at least one additional class of antimicrobial agent. Ongoing surveillance of Enterobacteriaceae will be particularly important to monitor changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility, as well as changes in the prevalence of isolates resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Bacteriology of burns at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi.
AB  - A retrospective study to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of burn isolates at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi was undertaken. While a total of 1825 burn patients were admitted to the hospital over a 6-year period (January 1994 to December 1999) only 317 (17.4%) specimens selected from as many patients were processed. One hundred and seventy (170/53.6%) specimens yielded single while the rest (147/46.4%) had multiple isolates giving a total of 535 bacterial isolates. Of this number, 236 (44.1%) were Gram-negatives and 299 (55.9%), Gram-positives. Among the Gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Coliforms/Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common accounting for 94.1% while in the Gram-positive group, staphylococcal and streptococcal spp. predominated (100%). However, the three most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (37.6%), P. aeruginosa (22.4%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (13.6%). While S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were most susceptible to penicillin (33.3 and 64.4% susceptibility, respectively), gentamycin appeared most effective against P. aeruginosa (53.3%). A general broad-spectrum resistance to panels of antibiotics used in the study was however observed among the bacterial isolates. From these results, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, streptococcal spp., P. mirabilis, Coliforms and K. pneumoniae representing 96.4% of all isolates were the most common in the Burns Unit.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - A UK multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the UK to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. METHOD: During 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing UTI were collected from 8 centres in the UK. Isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired UTI in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired UTI other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired UTI in those greater than 65 years old (392). After re-identification, MICs for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using NCCLS procedures and interpretive guidelines. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). The next three pathogens of importance were Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. The activity of amoxycillin against E. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). Cefuroxime was very active against E. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). Cefuroxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of E. coli (96.3% susceptible) and E. faecalis but not against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. Ciprofloxacin was highly active against the UTI pathogens examined in this study with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (E. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against Pseudomonas spp. CONCLUSION: These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing UTI in the UK.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens.
AB  - The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. The pathogens traditionally associated with UTI are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTI is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate UTI, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTI has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTI, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTI are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTI among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp., Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., as well as E coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis.Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for UTI. The need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent, particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. This information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for UTI.
TI  - Development of resistant bacteria isolated from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections after exposure to enrofloxacin in vitro.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations for enrofloxacin were determined for 63 bacterial isolates from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections. Development of resistant mutants was determined after exposing the isolates to enrofloxacin in vitro for up to five serial passages. Results indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp isolates exposed to enrofloxacin developed resistance rapidly, whereas Klebsiella, Proteus, and Streptococcus spp were less likely to develop resistance. Despite the presence of enrofloxacin pressure, no resistant bacteria developed in the Escherichia coli and staphylococcal isolates. In many isolates, susceptibility patterns changed from susceptible to intermediate.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - AcrAB multidrug efflux pump is associated with reduced levels of susceptibility to tigecycline (GAR-936) in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Tigecycline has good broad-spectrum activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens with the notable exception of the PROTEEAE: A study was performed to identify the mechanism responsible for the reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in Proteus mirabilis. Two independent transposon insertion mutants of P. mirabilis that had 16-fold-increased susceptibility to tigecycline were mapped to the acrB gene homolog of the Escherichia coli AcrRAB efflux system. Wild-type levels of decreased susceptibility to tigecycline were restored to the insertion mutants by complementation with a clone containing a PCR-derived fragment from the parental wild-type acrRAB efflux gene cluster. The AcrAB transport system appears to be associated with the intrinsic reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in P. mirabilis.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women in Benin City, Nigeria.
AB  - A semi-quantitative screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria was carried out in the first trimester of 500 consecutive pregnant women in Benin City. The purpose was to provide baseline data and rational therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. Of the 500 women screened, 433 clinical specimens showed significant bacteriuria, representing an incidence of 86.6%. Of this number, 38 (7.4%) were of mixed bacterial colonies while 395 (91%) were of single bacterial colonies. Staphylococcus aureus (29.8%), Escherichia coli (29.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.5%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. The high incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with the observed high proportion of pyuria. On average, sensitivity of the pathogens was ciprofloxacin 99.7%; ceftazidime 81.6%; co-trimoxazole 79.4%; augmentin 71.4%; nalidixic acid 61.7%; nitrofurantoin 61.%; gentamycin 56.9% and ampicillin 25.4%. S. aureus was most sensitive, while Proteus mirabilis was least sensitive among the pathogens. Rational therapy of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women may prevent associated risks such as pyelonephritis and pre-eclampsia.
TI  - Contamination levels of in-use disinfectants in a teaching hospital in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - In-use testing of the disinfectants; Hibitane (5% w/v Chlorhexidinegluconate), Hibiscrub (4% w/v Chlorhexidinegluconate), Savlon (3% w/v Chlorhexidine/Cetrimide), hydrogen peroxide (6% w/v hydrogen peroxide with stabilizer) and a common household bleach Jik (3.5% w/v sodium hypochlorite), was carried out over a two-month period at a university teaching hospital in Nigeria. Contamination levels were high with 82 (63.1%) of the 130 in-use disinfectants contaminated. However, a few of the stock solutions remained sterile. One hundred and thirty-four isolates were obtained of which 120 (91%) were gram-negative with Pseudomonas species being the commonest, constituting 67.2% of all the isolates. Gram-positive organisms made up the remaining 12 (9.0%) isolates. All the Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to gentamicin, ceftazidime, nalidixic acid and perfloxacin. Contributory factors for the high contamination levels were dilution of disinfectants with tap water, inadequate care of stock solution bottles and long storage of the diluted disinfectants in the wards.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Integration of a transposon Tn1-encoded inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase gene,  bla(TEM-67) from Proteus mirabilis, into the Escherichia coli chromosome.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis NEL-1 was isolated from a urine sample of a patient hospitalized in a long-term care facility. Strain NEL-1 produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.2 conferring resistance to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Sequencing of a PCR amplicon by using TEM-specific primers revealed a novel bla(TEM) gene, bla(TEM-67). TEM-67 was an IRT-1-like TEM derivative related to TEM-65 (Lys39, Cys244) with an additional Leu21Ile amino acid substitution in the leader peptide. The biochemical properties of TEM-67 were equivalent to those described for TEM-65. Analysis of sequences surrounding bla(TEM-67) revealed that it was located on a transposon, Tn1, which itself was located on a 48-kb non-self-transferable plasmid, pANG-1. Electroporation of plasmid pANG-1 into Escherichia coli DH10B resulted in the integration of bla(TEM-67) into the chromosome, whereas it remained episomal in the P. mirabilis CIP103181 reference strain. Further characterization of pANG-1 revealed the presence of two identical sequences on both sides of Tn1 that contained an IS26 insertion sequence followed by a novel colicin gene, colZ, which had 20% amino acid identity with other colicin genes. The characterization of this novel TEM derivative provides further evidence for the large diversity of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases produced in P. mirabilis and for their spread to other enterobacterial species through transposable-element-mediated events.
TI  - [Amyloidosis associated with chronic granulomatous disease in a patient with a renal transplant and recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  - Chronic granulomatous disease is a group of syndromes which share a defect in a component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase complex. Without this enzyme activity, phagocytic cells cannot produce superoxide, peroxide, and other potent microbicidal radicals, and are less able to kill ingested pathogens. The clinical picture is characterised by recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and abnormal tissue granuloma formation. On the other hand, amyloidosis is a systemic disease with renal involvement occurring in the majority of cases. Recurrent amyloidosis is a rare but well documented event in renal transplant recipients. However, graft loss secondary to amyloidosis has been noted infrequently. In addition, de novo amyloidosis has not been previously associated with graft loss. We report here a renal transplant recipient with chronic granulomatous disease and history of recurrent urinary tract infections, who developed nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency secondary to de novo AA amyloidosis leading to graft loss 66 months after transplantation.
TI  - An international survey of the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections: the ECO.SENS Project.
AB  - The ECO.SENS study is the first international survey to investigate the prevalence and susceptibility of pathogens causing community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Midstream urine samples were taken for culture and for testing for the presence of leucocytes from 4734 women not older than 65 years presenting with symptoms of acute UTI at 252 community health care centres in 17 countries. Recognized urinary tract pathogens were identified and the susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials determined. Pathogens were present in 3278 (69.2%) patients, Escherichia coli accounting for 77.0% of isolates. In E. coli, 42% of the isolates were resistant to one or more of the 12 antimicrobial drugs investigated. Resistance was most common to ampicillin (29.8%) and sulfamethoxazole (29.1%), followed by trimethoprim (14.8%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (14.1%) and nalidixic acid (5.4%). Resistance in E. coli to co-amoxiclav, mecillinam, cefadroxil, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin was <3%. However, co-amoxiclav resistance was apparent in Portugal (9.3%) as was resistance to the quinolones, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, in Portugal (11.6% and 5.8%, respectively) and Spain (26.7% and 14.7%, respectively). Overall, Proteus mirabilis were less resistant to ampicillin (16.1%) and more resistant to trimethoprim (25.5%) than E. coli, whereas Klebsiella spp. were more resistant to ampicillin (83.5%) and fosfomycin (56.7%). 'Other Enterobacteriaceae' were more resistant to the broad spectrum beta-lactams (ampicillin 45.9%, co-amoxiclav 21.3% and cefadroxil 24.6%), nitrofurantoin (40.2%) and fosfomycin (15.6%). In Staphylococcus saprophyticus resistance development was rare. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was lowest in the Nordic countries and Austria and highest in Portugal and Spain.
TI  - Necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum is a fulminant, life-threatening condition. This infection is usually polymicrobial and may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or surgery. Histologically, it is characterized by obliterative endarteritis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous vessels, fascial necrosis, and leukocytic infiltration. Mortality rates of 25-75% have been reported. Most cases of necrotizing gangrene begin insidiously, with scrotal discomfort and malaise. Later, erythema, increasing pain, and swelling, associated with fever and chills, develop. A biopsy is useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to obtain culture samples. Ultrasound imaging may reveal gas or testicular involvement and may help to distinguish this infection from other causes of scrotal pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum, seen at the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Sections of our Institutions between 1994 and 1999, are described. RESULTS: This series included 11 men (73%) and four women (27%), aged 39-68 years (mean, 51 years). In our series, Clostridium perfingens, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumani, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans were isolated. Hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring were performed in all patients. Intravenous antimicrobial therapy was promptly instituted. In most cases, two or more drugs were used. Concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was always required. When needed, split-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the penile shaft. Expanded mesh grafts were used to reconstruct the vulva and other denuded beds. The survival rate in this series was 87%. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The usual polymicrobial infection with vascular involvement demands hemodynamic stabilization, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement. In some patients, genital, perineal, and abdominal wall reconstruction is also required.
TI  - Role of RsmA in the regulation of swarming motility and virulence factor expression in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Swarming by Proteus mirabilis involves differentiation of typical short vegetative rods into filamentous hyper-flagellated swarm cells that undergo cycles of rapid and co-ordinated population migration across surfaces and exhibit high levels of virulence gene expression. RsmA (repressor of secondary metabolites) and CsrA, its homologue in Escherichia coli, control many phenotypic traits, such as motility and pathogenesis in Erwinia species, glycogen biosynthesis, cell size and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli and swarming motility in Serratia marcescens. To investigate the role of RsmA in Proteus mirabilis, the rsmA gene from Proteus mirabilis (hereafter referred to as rsmA(Pm)) was cloned. RsmA(Pm) showed high sequence similarity to Escherichia coli CsrA and RsmA cloned from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacillus subtilis and could complement an Escherichia coli csrA mutant in glycogen synthesis. A low-copy-number plasmid carrying rsmA(Pm) expressed from its native promoter caused suppression of swarming motility and expression of virulence factors in Proteus mirabilis. mRNA stability assays suggested that RsmA(Pm) inhibited virulence factor expression through promoting mRNA degradation. RsmA homologues cloned from Serratia marcescens and Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora could also inhibit swarming and virulence factor expression in Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils isolated from Portuguese endemic species of Thymus.
AB  - AIMS: Thymus species are wild species mostly found in the arid lands of Portugal. Possible antimicrobial properties of Thymus essential oils have been investigated. The chemical composition of the essential oils and the antimicrobial activity of Thymus mastichina (L) L. subsp. mastichina, T. camphoratus and T. lotocephalus from different regions of Portugal were analysed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hydrodistillation was used to isolate the essential oils and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC coupled to mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by the disc agar diffusion technique against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Pure linalool, 1,8-cineole and a mixture (1 : 1) of these compounds were included. Linalool, 1,8-cineole or linalool/1,8-cineole and linalool/1,8-cineole/linalyl acetate were the major components of the essential oils, depending on the species or sampling place. The essential oils isolated from the Thymus species studied demonstrated antimicrobial activity but the micro-organisms tested had significantly different sensitivities. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial activity of essential oils may be related to more than one component. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Portuguese endemic species of Thymus can be used for essential oil production for food spoilage control, cosmetics and pharmaceutical use. Further studies will be required to elucidate the cell targets of the essential oil components.
TI  - Epidemiology of bloodstream infection in nursing home residents: evaluation in a  large cohort from multiple homes.
AB  - This study sought to reevaluate the epidemiology of bloodstream infection in nursing home residents. The records of 166 nursing home residents admitted to an urban, public, university-affiliated hospital with 169 episodes of bloodstream infection between January 1997 and April 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (27% of isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (18%; 29% were methicillin-resistant strains), and Proteus mirabilis (13%). There was minimal resistance to quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The most common sources were the urinary tract (51% of episodes) and the lungs (11%); a source was not identified in 22% of episodes. Hospital mortality was 18%. Independent predictors of hospital mortality were a pulmonary source of infection, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, and leukocytosis >20,000 cells/mm3. Compared with other studies published in the past 2 decades, mortality was lower. The most common resistant organism was methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - First occurrence of transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase hydrolyzing cefoperazone in multiresistant nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae from two hospitals in Czech and Slovak Republics.
AB  - The occurrence of positive synergy between antibiotic discs of amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefoperazone was registered in two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from hospitals in Czech and Slovak Republic, indicating the presence of genes coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase active also against cefoperazone, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. Sulbactam inhibited the hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cell-free lysates of these strains which substantiates its use in combination with cefoperazone. Resistance to cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime and aztreonam was transferred from K. pneumoniae isolates to Escherichia coli K-12 3110 and to Proteus mirabilis P-38 recipient strains.
TI  - The Helicobacter pylori flbA flagellar biosynthesis and regulatory gene is required for motility and virulence and modulates urease of H. pylori and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori and Proteus mirabilis ureases are nickel-requiring metallo-enzymes that hydrolyse urea to NH3 and CO2. In both H. pylori and in an Escherichia coli model of H. pylori urease activity, a high affinity nickel transporter, NixA, is required for optimal urease activity, whereas the urea-dependent UreR positive transcriptional activator governs optimal urease expression in P. mirabilis. The H. pylori flbA gene is a flagellar biosynthesis and regulatory gene that modulates urease activity in the E. coli model of H. pylori urease activity. All flbA mutants of eight strains of H. pylori were non-motile and five had a strain-dependent alteration in urease activity. The flbA gene decreased urease activity 15-fold when expressed in E. coli containing the H. pylori urease locus and the nixA gene; this was reversed by disruption of flbA. The flbA gene decreased nixA transcription. flbA also decreased urease activity three-fold in E. coli containing the P. mirabilis urease locus in a urea- and UreR-dependent fashion. Here the flbA gene repressed the P. mirabilis urease promoter. Thus, FlbA decreased urease activity of both H. pylori and P. mirabilis, but through distinct mechanisms. H. pylori wild-type strain SS1 colonised gerbils at a mean of 5.4 x 10(6) cfu/g of antrum and caused chronic gastritis and lesions in the antrum. In contrast, the flbA mutant did not colonise five of six gerbils and caused no lesions, indicating that motility mediated by flbA was required for colonisation. Because FlbA regulates flagellar biosynthesis and secretion, as well as forming a structural component of the flagellar secretion apparatus, two seemingly unrelated virulence attributes, motility and urease, may be coupled in H. pylori and P. mirabilis and possibly also in other motile, ureolytic bacteria.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of TEM-92 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, a protein differing from TEM-52 in the signal peptide.
AB  - A bla(TEM-92) gene was cloned from a Proteus mirabilis isolate and expressed in Escherichia coli. Production of the enzyme caused reduction of susceptibility to penicillins and narrow- to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins but not to moxalactam and cephamycins. Determination of kinetic parameters with the purified enzyme revealed hydrolysis of expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, while cephamycins, moxalactam, and aztreonam were very poorly or not hydrolyzed. Clavulanate and penicillanic acid sulfones acylated TEM-92 slowly, and deacylation occurred at measurable rates.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Vietnam.
AB  - Among 730 Escherichia coli, 438 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 141 Proteus mirabilis  isolates obtained between September 2000 and September 2001 in seven hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 26.6% were resistant to ceftazidime, 30% were resistant to cefotaxime, 31.5% were resistant to ceftriaxone, 15.9% were resistant to cefoperazone, and 6% were resistant to cefepime. Resistance to imipenem was found in 5.6% of the isolates. In 55 strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (32 E. coli isolates, 13 K. pneumoniae isolates, and 10 P. mirabilis isolates), structural genes for VEB-1 (25.5%), CTX-M (25.5%), SHV (38.1%), and TEM (76.3%) enzymes were detected alone or in combination. Sequencing of the PCR products obtained from the K. pneumoniae isolates revealed the presence of bla(VEB-1), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-17), bla(SHV-2), and bla(TEM-1). Molecular typing of the strains with a similar resistance phenotype to broad-spectrum cephalosporins indicated polyclonal spread. ISEcp1 was presumably responsible for dissemination of the bla(CTX-M-like) gene.
TI  - Serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because the effect of CPB on serum drug levels is poorly understood. Current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. Few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. This study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin in CPB surgery. METHODS: This prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent CABG surgery. We compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. RESULTS: Serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the MIC90, for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. The serum levels fell below the MIC90 for Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum cefazolin levels during CPB remained consistently above the MIC for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder. Additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.
TI  - Infestation of fish-culturing communities with fish-borne bacteria: the Ghanaian  case.
AB  - Twenty different bacterial species were isolated from fishermen and members of communities associated with seven fish ponds with different fertilizer treatments, and an open system. The number and types of the bacterial species were different for the different ponds. Generally, neither the geographical location of the ponds nor the type of fertilizer used could be related to the bacterial flora. Escherichia coli was the predominant species in all the communities, while Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp., Shigella sp. or Streptococcus faecalis were common in individuals of communities of sewage-fed pond.
TI  - Comparison of three chromogenic agar plates for isolation and identification of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To comparatively assess the performance of three chromogenic agar plates, CPS ID2, Chromogenic UTI, and USA, for the detection and enumeration of all urinary tract pathogens and the direct identification of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus spp. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-three urine specimens prospectively collected from hospitalized patients were randomly inoculated in parallel on the three media. RESULTS: Of the 243 urine specimens, 235 yielded positive cultures, of which 151 were pure cultures and 84 were mixed cultures. CPS ID2, Chromogenic UTI and USA agar gave detection rates of 99.1%, 97.1% and 96.6%, respectively. The main difference in non-detection between CPS ID2 agar and the two new media concerned Staphylococcus spp. strains. Based on the total number of strains detected (n = 348), the total identification rates of E. coli, P. mirabilis and Enterococcus spp. on CPS ID2 agar, Chromogenic UTI agar and USA agar were 60.3%, 61.2% and 59.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The detection rates and identification rates of the three media were very close and only minor differences were noted. The lower detection rates for Chromogenic UTI and USA were mainly due to their lesser ability to support growth of Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - Is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  - There is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. Is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? Seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital day surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. Surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. Of the 731 children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin preparation and on completion of the operation. Staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by Escherichia coli (19%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%), while S. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. The efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. In only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (S. aureus and S. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. Cultures taken at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly S. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). Children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and had passed urine. The wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. Follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the Southampton Wound Assessment Scale. Ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. Our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. Routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. Only 1.5% of postoperative cases will require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.
TI  - Infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and healthy control subjects. METHODS: Sixty four patients with previous AAU and 64 sex and age matched controls were studied. Serum antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Borrelia burgdorferi were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence test. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), separated by density gradient centrifugation, were studied for Salmonella and Yersinia antigens by means of an immunofluorescence test, and for C pneumoniae DNA with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Neither prevalence nor levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and control subjects, or between subgroups of patients created on the basis of clinical characteristics. In logistic regression analysis, the high number of recurrences (>10) of AAU was independently related to the presence of single or multiple bacterial antibodies (p=0.04). None of the PBMC samples of the patients were positive for Yersinia or Salmonella antigens. C pneumoniae PCR was positive in a patient who was negative for C pneumoniae antibodies. CONCLUSION: Although neither the prevalence nor the levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and the controls, current data suggest that the presence of single or multiple antibodies in patients with many recurrences of AAU compared with patients with none or few recurrences may be a sign of repeated infections, antigen persistence, or raised innate immune responsiveness.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
AB  - We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) The MIC50 and MIC90 values of PZFX against clinically isolated Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. PZFX showed broad spectrum activity. The antibacterial activities of PZFX against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing Klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (IPM/CS)-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftriaxone, IPM/CS, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) PZFX showed superior bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa to those of CAZ and IPM/CS after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) CAZ and IPM/CS had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of MIC against P. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while PZFX exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) PZFX inhibited both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from S. aureus at nearly the same level. PZFX showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase II from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) PZFX mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of CAZ with following infection model caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, CMC pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) Intravenous administration of PZFX with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of folklore: Mallotus peltatus leaf  extract.
AB  - Since ages Mallotus peltatus (Geist) Muell. Arg. var acuminatus (Euphorbiaceae) leaf and stem bark is used in folk medicine to cure intestinal ailments and skin infections. In several intestinal ailments, localized inflammation is of common occurrence and hence we have evaluated the antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory activity of M. peltatus leaf extract. The crude methanol extract of M. peltatus leaves was found to be active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis and the dermatophytic fungi Microsporum gypseum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges from 128 to 2000 microg ml(-1) for bacteria and 128 mg ml(-1) for fungi, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was 2-4-fold higher than MIC. The methanol-water fraction of the extract showed similar activity against Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus and Proteus isolates. The anti-inflammatory activity of the extract against carrageenan (acute model) and dextran-induced (subacute model) rat paw oedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma (chronic model) in rats were studied using indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)), a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, as standard. The methanol extract at 200 and 400 mg kg(-1), and the n-butanol fractions A and B at 25 mg kg(-1), exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in Albino rats, compared with indomethacin. Phytochemical study revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, steroids and reducing sugars in the crude extract while the n-butanol fractions showed the presence of ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol and some fatty acids as major compounds. Further study with fractions showed that the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity is due to either fraction A (ursolic acid) alone or the combination of fractions A and B (beta-sitosterol and fatty acids) of the extract.
TI  - [Antimicrobial, echinococcidial and immunostimulating properties of the drug Cheblin-SK-1].
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of the drug Cheblin-CK-1 (CCK-1) were determined in  mice intraabdominally inoculated with Proteus mirabilis-4691 in a dose of 140-200 million daily cultured microbial bodies. Its comparison agent was ampicillin. CCK-1 was found to act as an antibiotic similar to ampicillin in its effects. The antimicrobial activity of CCK-1 against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolated from the contents of echinococcal cysts from patients operated on was also established. Its echinococcidial activity was found in experiments on the cotton rats and piglets inocculated with echinococci. CCK-1 was also tested on volunteers. Before surgery, 186 patients with echinococcosis took the drug and 26 patients with the same disease did not and they served as controls. At first the drug suppressed the growth of parasitic larvocysts with destruction and death of 85-95% of germinal elements of larvocysts and then killed parasites. In patients receiving a complete course of its therapy, protein and amino acid metabolisms restored, followed by immunity recovery.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Development of an ELISA using a recombinant 41 kDa partial protein (P45N') for the detection of Riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  - Riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to facilitate early detection of R. anatipestifer infection in ducks. The antigen used was a recombinant 41 kDa N-terminal fragment (rP45N') of a newly characterized R. anatipestifer potential surface protein, P45, which was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal GST fusion protein. The rP45N'-based ELISA successfully detected P45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of R. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the ATCC11845 strain. Antibodies to P45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of White Pekin ducks which were imported into Singapore from three different farms. Successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). The rP45N'-GST antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pastuerella multocida, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Serratia maccescens, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, the DNA sequence encoding P45 was detected in R. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the ATCC11845 strain, suggesting that P45 is probably also universally expressed in these R. anatipestifer serotypes. Thus, the ELISA described is applicable to the detection of R. anatipestifer infection in ducks.
TI  - First report of a parasitic copepod (Pennella balaenopterae) infestation in a pinniped.
AB  - An infestation by the parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae was found in a stranded, 8-mo-old, female northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris). Diagnosis was based on the finding of the cephalothoraxes of 14 adult female copepods from three subcutaneous sites. Bacteria cultured from lesion exudate included Arcanobacterium phocae, Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, an Enterococcus sp., and Proteus mirabilis. The lesions were drained and irrigated with chlorhexidine, and the seal was treated with a subcutaneous injection of ivermectin. The seal recovered and was released after 43 days.
TI  - A case of purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS).
AB  
TI  - Characterization of flagella produced by clinical strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen associated with opportunistic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and HIV. Adherence of this organism to abiotic surfaces such as medical implants and catheters represents a major risk for hospitalized patients. The adhesive surface factors involved in adherence of these bacteria are largely unknown, and their flagella have not yet been characterized biochemically and antigenically. We purified and characterized the flagella produced by S. maltophilia clinical strains. The flagella filaments are composed of a 38-kDa subunit, SM(FliC), and analysis of its N-terminal amino acid sequence showed considerable sequence identity to the flagellins of Serratia marcescens (78.6%), Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei (71.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.2%). Ultrastructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy of bacteria adhering to plastic showed flagellalike structures within the bacterial clusters, suggesting that flagella are produced as the bacteria spread on the abiotic surface.
TI  - [Experimental study on bacteriostasis of chitosan and sodium hyaluronate].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect and coverage of bacteriostasis of chitosan and sodium hyaluronate. METHODS: Each of the five bacteria, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, was cultivated for 33 tubes of broth culture. Leaving three tubes each group as control group, ploidy diluted concentration of high relative molecular weight chitosan, low relative molecular weight chitosan and sodium hyaluronate were added respectively in the broth culture. All the tubes were cultivated for 18 hours at 37 degrees C with homeothermia. Then the growth of bacteria was observed. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of high relative molecular weight chitosan were: Proteus mirabilis 0.031%, Escherichia coli 0.063%, Candida albicans 0.063%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.063%, Staphylococcus aureus 0.063%; and the MIC of low relative molecular weight chitosan were: Proteus mirabilis 0.125%, Escherichia coli 0.025%, Candida albicans 0.25%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.25%, Staphylococcus aureus 0.125%; bacteria grew well in each tube of sodium hyaluronate group and control group. CONCLUSION: The above results show that sodium hyaluronate has no bacteriostasis, while chitosan has bacteriostasis on broad spectrum and high relative molecular weigh: chitosan has stronger effect.
TI  - Assessment of PEO/PTMO multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane blends as coating materials for urinary catheters: in vitro bacterial adhesion and encrustation behavior.
AB  - The effective long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated infection and encrustation. In this study, the suitability of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane (SPU) blends as coating materials for the commercial urinary catheters was assessed by measuring swellability, bacterial adhesion, and encrustation behavior. When exposed to PBS (pH 7.4), the blends absorbed a significant amount of water, which was proportional to the copolymer content. It was demonstrated from bacterial adhesion tests that compared to bare SPU, the blend surfaces could significantly reduce the adhesion of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and S. epidermidis; the number of adherent bacteria correlated with the amount of copolymer additive. indicating that the swellability of the blends affected bacterial adhesion. Of the bacteria studied, the greatest effect of the copolymer additive was observed in S. epidermidis adhesion, in which there was an 85% decrease compared to bare SPU with a small amount of copolymer additive as low as 5% based on a dried blend. By using an artificial bladder model, allowing the catheter to be blocked by encrustation, it was revealed that the blend surfaces could effectively resist encrustation. The duration of patency was extended up to 20 +/- 3.1 h on the blend surface containing 10% of the copolymer additive, whereas the silicone-coated catheter, a control, required the least time for blockage, 7.8 +/- 3.1 h. The superior characteristics of the blends compared to other surfaces might be attributed to their PEO-rich surfaces, produced by the migration of PEO phase in the copolymer chain of the blends in an aqueous environment, and provide promising potential as a coating material on the urinary catheter for long-term catheterization.
TI  - Evaluation of a new Etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  - Several Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (IP) or ceftazidime (TZ) MICs in the presence of EDTA or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The Etest metallo-beta-lactamase (Etest MBL) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of IP or TZ (4 to 256 microg/ml) and IP or TZ (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of EDTA or MPA. The prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, Isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and Mueller-Hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: Acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), Aeromonas spp. (n = 8), Chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Serratia spp. (n = 10), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), Sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). PCR analysis using specific primers for IMP-1, L1, CcrA, and bla(B/C) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. Enzyme assays were also performed with IP as an indicator substrate followed by EDTA inhibition profiles. EDTA was found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. IP was a better than TZ. Mueller-Hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to Isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low MICs for IP. Etest IP plus IP-EDTA with Mueller-Hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). The Etest MBL strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Interaction of the atypical prokaryotic transcription activator FlhD2C2 with early promoters of the flagellar gene hierarchy.
AB  - The transcriptional activator FlhD2C2 is the master regulator of bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming migration, activating the "early" class II promoters of the large flagellar gene hierarchy. Using primer extensions, band-shift assays, and enzymatic and chemical footprinting, we describe the binding of the FlhD2C2 heterotetramer to the promoter regions of four class II flagella operons, fliAZ, flhBA and the divergent flgAMN and flgBCD(EFGHIJ). Each of the promoter regions was bound by a single heterotetramer, i.e. the flgAMN and flgBCD operons are characterised by a single FlhD2C2 binding site. Binding affinity differed, and correlated with previously reported promoter strength and order of activation. Methylation protection and interference, and depurination and depyrimidation interference provided a detailed map of critical bases within a common 46-59bp DNaseI footprint overlapping the promoter -35 sequences. These data and compilation of the 12 known class II promoter sequences of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium allowed determination of a FlhD2C2 binding site with pseudo symmetry, comprising two 17-18bp inverted repeats, each a consensus FlhD2C2 box, separated by a 10-11bp spacer. DNaseI hypersensitivity indicated that binding may cause a conformational change in the promoter regions. Only the FlhC subunit can bind DNA independently, but the specificity and stability of the interaction is strengthened by FlhD. Here, photo-crosslinking established that both FlhC and the stabilising FlhD contact the DNA within the FlhD2C2 tetramer. Our data suggest that specificity of recognition and stability of the FlhD2C2/DNA complex require protein-protein interaction and interaction of both FlhC and FlhD subunits with DNA. These characteristics of the FlhD and FlhC subunits in the FlhD2C2/DNA complex are strikingly atypical of prokaryotic regulators.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - Lomefloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 182 patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) were recruited into this multicentre prospective, randomized clinical study. Of these, 93 were treated orally with lomefloxacin (LOMX) 400 mg once daily and 89 with ciprofloxacin (CIPX) 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. At 5-9 days 90/90 vs 86/86, at 4-6 weeks 82/83 vs 82/82, at 3 months 80/79 vs 78/75, and at 6 months 78/75 vs 75/72 patients aging from 18 to 70 years were evaluable bacteriologically/clinically according to a modified intention to treat evaluation. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli, followed by staphylococci, enterococci and Proteus mirabilis. At 5-9 days, 4-6 weeks, 3 and 6 months after therapy the rates of eradication without superinfection per evaluable patients (100%) were 80, 72, 74, and 63% in the LOMX group and 84, 81, 82, and 72% in the CIPX group and (cure and improvement) rates were 98 vs 97%, 84 vs 90%, 86 vs 89%, and 81 vs 89%. There were no statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between the results of the two treatment groups. Nine (5 vs 4) patients were withdrawn because of adverse events. From the bacteriological and clinical results including adverse events, the oral treatment of CBP over 4 weeks with LOMX 400 mg once daily was comparably effective and tolerable with that of CIPX 500 mg twice daily.
TI  - Resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (UTI) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. Older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria isolated from UTI. Resistant isolates are more frequent in long-term care populations than the community. Resistant isolates include common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Providencia stuartii. Isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. The increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. Therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. Antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. In particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. Where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. This permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. Where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. Where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.
TI  - The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens.
AB  - The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. The pathogens traditionally associated with UTI are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTI is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate UTI, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTI has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTI, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTI are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTI among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp., Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., as well as E coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis.Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for UTI. The need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent, particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. This information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for UTI.
TI  - A comparison of the performance of cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar with Oxoid chromogenic urinary tract infection (CUTI) medium for the isolation and presumptive identification of organisms from urine.
AB  - AIMS: As part of the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy and action plan, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) is required to collect antibiotic susceptibility data so that resistance trends and patterns can be monitored. Most laboratories report urine Gram negative isolates, as "coliforms" according to morphological appearance, but without an acceptable identification system the antimicrobial surveillance data will be meaningless. Commercially available identification systems tend to be expensive and time consuming. Chromogenic agars, which claim to improve the detection of mixed cultures and identification of organisms from urine, have now become available and may provide a cost effective alternative. The primary aim of this study was to compare the performance of cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar with a chromogenic agar (Oxoid urinary tract infection medium; CUTI) in terms of isolation rates and ability to detect mixed cultures. Secondary aims were to evaluate the correlation of "presumptive" identification of isolates from chromogenic media with that of two commercial identification systems and to appraise the sensitivity of the semiquantitative loop and filter paper strip culture techniques. METHOD: One thousand, four hundred and sixty six urine samples were examined in four laboratories using the semiquantitative culture methods of 1 microl loop and filter paper strip. The degree of accuracy of organism identification was measured by comparing the presumptive identification using colony colour supplemented with simple bench tests, with identification obtained from two more complex commercial systems. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the performance of the loop and filter paper strip methods on the CLED agar, but the CUTI agar performed significantly better than the CLED agar for the detection of significant isolates and mixed cultures. This difference was greater using the loop method. Identification of the organisms using the commercial systems gave > 99% agreement and was therefore considered suitable as a standard against which to compare the presumptive CUTI identification. Using the manufacturer's colony colour criteria in combination with a bench indole test, the CUTI medium was 99% specific for Escherichia coli, although this was reduced to 97% if the indole test was omitted. Citrobacter spp were the most commonly misidentified organisms, giving false presumptive identification as E coli. By testing oxidase activity to differentiate Pseudomonas spp and the absence of indole production to support the identification of Proteus mirabilis, the CUTI medium provided a suitable identification for 86.8% of Gram negative isolates. The remaining 13.2% would require further identification. CONCLUSION: CUTI medium improves the detection of mixed cultures, thereby improving the reliability of reporting of significant isolates when compared with CLED agar. When supplemented with simple bench tests it provides an identification system capable of speciating 86.8% of Gram negative isolates and providing a valuable cost effective mechanism for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.
TI  - Emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. Collected from a major teaching hospital in Taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. The overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. Isolates of Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. By 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. Activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. Interestingly, some strains of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in Taiwan. This resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of S. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. After the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of Enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. Different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was not due to the spread of a single clone. We conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan, especially in recent years. Appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Numbers and types of microorganisms in vacuum-packed cold-smoked freshwater fish  at the retail level.
AB  - Fifty-four packages (each one belonging to a different lot) of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon (30) and trout (24) produced by six Spanish smokehouses were obtained at retail level after 3 weeks storage at 2+/-1 degrees C. Sensorial, chemical, physicochemical and microbiological characteristics were examined. Overall, pH, a(w), salt content in water phase, aerobic plate counts at 30 and 25 degrees C. levels of Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), fungi and presumptive aeromonads and staphylococci are in agreement with available data on lightly preserved fish products. Psychrotrophic clostridia ranged between 1.71 and 2.21 log CFU/g. Levels of ethanol were highly variable and not significantly related (p > 0.05) to sensory scores or to microbial numbers. Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in any sample. Listeriae other than L. monocytogenes were isolated from three packages. Levels of Staphylococcus aureus lower than 4 log CFU/g were also found in three packages. Among 377 bacteria randomly isolated from aerobic 25 degrees C plate counts, LAB predominated, with Carnobacterium (C. piscicola) and Lactobacillus (eight species) being the genera most frequently found. The second and third major groups were Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae, respectively. Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis and Serratia liquefaciens were dominant among Enterobacteriaceae and coagulase-negative staphylococci among Micrococcaceae. Minor microbial groups such as aerobic gram-negative bacilli (Acinetobacter; Moraxella and Pseudomonas), Brochothrix, Aeromonas, Bacillus and Vibrio constituted less than 17% of the total flora.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - New carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase (CARB-7) from Vibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 strains encoded by the VCR region of the V. cholerae genome.
AB  - In a previous study, an analysis of 77 ampicillin-nonsusceptible (resistant plus  intermediate categories) strains of Vibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139, isolated from aquatic environment and diarrheal stool, showed that all of them produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.4. Hybridization or amplification by PCR with a probe for bla(TEM) or primers for bla(CARB) gene families was negative. In this work, an environmental ampicillin-resistant strain from this sample, ME11762, isolated from a waterway in the west region of Argentina, was studied. The nucleotide sequence of the structural gene of the beta-lactamase was determined by bidirectional sequencing of a Sau3AI fragment belonging to this isolate. The gene encodes a new 288-amino-acid protein, designated CARB-7, that shares 88.5% homology with the CARB-6 enzyme; an overall 83.2% homology with PSE-4, PSE-1, CARB-3, and the Proteus mirabilis N29 enzymes; and 79% homology with CARB-4 enzyme. The gene for this beta-lactamase could not be transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation. The nucleotide sequence of the flanking regions of the bla(CARB-7) gene showed the occurrence of three 123-bp V. cholerae repeated sequences, all of which were found outside the predicted open reading frame. The upstream fragment of the bla(CARB-7) gene shared 93% identity with a locus situated inside V. cholerae's chromosome 2. These results strongly suggest the chromosomal location of the bla(CARB-7) gene, making this the first communication of a beta-lactamase gene located on the VCR island of the V. cholerae genome.
TI  - [A case of stone formation in the Mainz pouch using appendix as the efferent limb: a case report].
AB  - A large calculus (6.0 x 4.5 x 7.0 cm sized) in the continent urinary pouch was detected incidentally by computed tomography in a 7-year-old man with a gall bladder stone. He underwent a total cystectomy and Mainz pouch formation using appendix as the efferent limb for bladder cancer 7 years ago. Urine culture showed Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, and urine pH was 8.5. The stone was removed successfully through a pouchotomy and composed mainly of struvite. The stone analysis was MAP; 88% and CaCO3; 12%. Convalescence was uneventful. This is the first case of in Mainz pouch using appendix as the efferent limb.
TI  - Evaluation of the DipStreak, a new device with an original streaking mechanism for detection, counting, and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - DipStreak is a new urine culture device with two types of agar attached back-to-back on a plastic paddle. It combines dip-slide technology and an original streaking inoculation mechanism, allowing for bacterial counting and colony isolation. The performance of the DipStreak device with two different medium formulations, CHROMagar and MacConkey media in study A and UriSelect 3 and MacConkey media in study B, was evaluated and compared to that of the reference streak method by using plates of cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient (CLED) agar, tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood, and UriSelect 3 medium. In study A, 2,000 urine specimens were processed and 511 cultures were found positive. The DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 and CLED medium plates gave the same detection rate, 99.7%. For the direct identification of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus sp. isolates, the DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 medium plate showed overall sensitivities of 97 and 93.4%, respectively. In study B, 3,000 urine specimens were processed and 714 cultures were found positive. The DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 and CLED medium plates gave detection rates of 99.4, 99.9, and 99.2%, respectively. For the direct identification of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Enterococcus sp. isolates, the DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 medium plate showed overall sensitivities of 88 and 94.4%, respectively. In conclusion, the DipStreak device with both medium formulations represents an attractive and excellent screening method for the reliable detection, counting, and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens. It enables bedside urine inoculation and provides a valid means of transporting the sample back to the laboratory, decreasing drastically the rate of false-positive results due to bacterial overgrowth and reducing associated costs.
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex PCR.
AB  - Therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. These organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. Six families of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. This report describes the development of a multiplex PCR for the purpose of identifying family-specific AmpC beta-lactamase genes within gram-negative pathogens. The PCR uses six sets of ampC-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampC multiplex PCR differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampC-specific families in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampC genes. Furthermore, this PCR-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. In addition, WAVE technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. In conclusion, a multiplex PCR technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampC genes responsible for AmpC beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase gene.
TI  - Effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-4 on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the mechanisms involved in bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to extraintestinal sites. Because the cytokine cascade associated with sepsis, inflammation, and trauma has been shown to affect intestinal epithelial permeability, experiments were designed to clarify the effects of selected cytokines on bacterial adherence to and internalization by cultured HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes. METHODS: Mature, confluent enterocytes were pretreated 48 to 72 h with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma, (IFN-gamma), or interleukin-4 (IL-4). Adherence of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bacterial internalization was quantified by the gentamicin protection assay. Enterocyte permeability was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and by flux of 40-kDa fluorescent dextran. Bacterial transmigration across confluent enterocytes was measured using enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. RESULTS: TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 had variable effects on bacterial adherence to HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes, although the most consistent finding was increased bacterial adherence associated with INF-gamma. However, none of these cytokines had a noticeable effect on bacterial internalization by either Caco-2 or HT-29 enterocytes. In addition, none of these cytokines had a noticeable effect on the permeability of confluent enterocytes as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance or dextran flux. Bacterial transmigration across confluent HT-29 enterocytes was not altered by TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, or IL-4; however, IL-4 consistently decreased bacterial transmigration across confluent Caco-2 enterocytes. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma may augment the epithelial adherence of selected species of enteric bacteria, and IL-4 may act as a barrier-sustaining agent to decrease bacterial migration across the intestinal epithelium.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Diversity of CTX-M beta-lactamases and their promoter regions from Enterobacteriaceae isolated in three Parisian hospitals.
AB  - Nine clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (six Escherichia coli and three Proteus mirabilis) isolated in three Parisian hospitals between 1989 and 2000 showed a particular extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistance profile characterized by resistance to cefotaxime and aztreonam but not to ceftazidime. CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14 and two novel plasmid-mediated CTX-M beta-lactamases (CTX-M-20, and CTX-M-21) were identified by polymerase chain reaction and isoelectric focusing (pI>8) and were associated in eight cases with TEM-1 (pI=5.4) or TEM-2 (pI=5.6) beta-lactamases. We used internal ISEcp1 and IS26 forward primers and the CTX-M consensus reverse primer to characterize the CTX-M beta-lactamase promoter regions and showed their high degree of structure diversity. We found upstream of some bla(CTX-M) genes, a 266-bp sequence 100% identical to the sequence upstream of the Kluyvera ascorbata beta-lactamase gene, suggesting that this chromosomal enzyme is the progenitor of the CTX-M-2/5 cluster.
TI  - Trends in fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) resistance in enterobacteriaceae from bacteremias, England and Wales, 1990-1999.
AB  - The Public Health Laboratory Service receives antibiotic susceptibility data for  bacteria from bloodstream infections from most hospitals in England and Wales. These data were used to ascertain resistance trends to ciprofloxacin from 1990 through 1999 for the most prevalent gram-negative agents: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Significant increases in resistance were observed for all four species groups. For E. coli, ciprofloxacin resistance rose from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.7% in 1999 and became widely scattered among reporting hospitals. The prevalence of resistance in Klebsiella spp. rose from 3.5% in 1990, to 9.5% in 1996 and 7.1% in 1999, while that in Enterobacter spp. rose from 2.1% in 1990 to 10.5% in 1996 and 10.9% in 1999. For both Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp., most resistance was localized in a few centers. Resistance was infrequent and scattered in P. mirabilis, but reached a prevalence of 3.3% in 1999.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - [Can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). A microbiological diagnosis can be made by examination of a urine sample, and in Danish family practice the diagnosis of UTI is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. These methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. The aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. No prior instruction in testing procedure was given. As the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the Department of Microbiology, University of Southern Denmark, were used. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. The corresponding figures for urine culture were 95% and 96%. The morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified correctly in terms of their motility. DISCUSSION: The results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae: an Italian survey.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. A total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten Italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated ESBL producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated ESBL producer, followed by K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). However, amongst all ESBL producers, K. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by P. mirabilis (25.7%). All the strains positive to DD tests were confirmed for the carriage of TEM and SHV genes using colony-blot hybridisation (CH). A total of 447 strains (88.0%) were CH-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the TEM-type probe, 30.1% with the SHV-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested produced ESBLs, 42.3% of which were TEM-derived enzymes. More than 20% of P. stuartii, K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. The double-disk test seems to be a useful test to identify ESBL producing strains.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing clinical isolates in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa: regional results from SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-99).
AB  - The frequency of occurrence of ESBL-producing clinical strains varies widely in distinct geographic areas. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence, the preferred substrate, and the co-resistance patterns of the ESBL-producing isolates collected from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program between January 1998 and December 1999. A total of 1,377 Escherichia coli, 678 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 138 Proteus mirabilis isolates were collected from diverse body sites. Using NCCLS criteria, 139 E. coli (10.1%), 171 K. pneumoniae (25.2%), and 2 P. mirabilis (1.4%) had presumptive ESBL phenotypes; 100, 146 and 1 strain respectively were confirmed to be ESBL producers on clavulanate enhancement testing. The frequency of occurrence of confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli by the medical centers varied from 0-1% for centers located in Australia to 13-35% for mainland Chinese centers. The higher prevalence rates (>20%) of ESBL K. pneumoniae phenotypes were observed in all mainland Chinese centers, one Japanese and one Taiwanese center, and in the Philippine, South African, Singaporean and medical centers. The spread of the presumptive ESBL phenotype to the Enterobacter species was observed in nine medical centers. Overall, ceftriaxone and aztreonam were the best substrates for the detection of the ESBL phenotype between both E. coli isolates and K. pneumoniae ESBL phenotypes; however, there was significant variation between countries in substrate preference. Co-resistances to gentamicin, tobramycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were common throughout isolates collected from most medical centers. Ciprofloxacin resistance rates were very high among isolates collected from Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, and the Philippines. The best coverage against ESBL-producing isolates was obtained with imipenem (0% resistance), followed by amikacin (6% resistance).
TI  - Properties and utility of the peculiar mixed disulfide in the bacterial glutathione transferase B1-1.
AB  - Bacterial glutathione transferases appear to represent an evolutionary link between the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase superfamilies. In particular, the observation of a mixed disulfide in the active site of Proteus mirabilis glutathione transferase B1-1 is a feature that links the two families. This peculiar mixed disulfide between Cys10 and one GSH molecule has been studied by means of ESR spectroscopy, stopped-flow kinetic analysis, radiochemistry, and site-directed mutagenesis. This disulfide can be reduced by dithiothreitol but even a thousand molar excess of GSH is poorly effective due to an unfavorable equilibrium constant of the redox reaction (K(eq) = 2 x 10(-4)). Although Cys10 is partially buried in the crystal structure, in solution it reacts with several thiol reagents at a higher or comparable rate than that shown by the free cysteine. Kinetics of the reaction of Cys10 with 4,4'-dithiodipyridine at variable pH values is consistent with a pK(a) of 8.0 +/- 0.1 for this residue, a value about 1 unit lower than that of the free cysteine. The 4,4'-dithiodipyridine-modified enzyme reacts with GSH in a two-step mechanism involving a fast precomplex formation, followed by a slower chemical step. The natural Cys10-GSH mixed disulfide exchanges rapidly with free [3H]GSH in a futile redox cycle in which the bound GSH is continuously replaced by the external GSH. Our data suggest that the active site of the bacterial enzyme has intermediate properties between those of the recently evolved glutathione transferases and those of the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily.
TI  - Histopathologic and bacteriologic evaluations of cellulitis detected in legs and  caudal abdominal regions of turkeys.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the causative agent of cellulitis in  turkeys. Eighteen flocks from nine producers were sampled at the local processing plant, and 37 birds with cellulitis on legs or caudal thoracic area were obtained. None of the 37 birds with cellulitis had lesions in other organs. On gross examination, lesions were categorized into two groups: cellulitis with unopened skin lesions (type a) and cellulitis with opened skin lesions (type b). Histopathologically, cellulitis with unopened skin lesions had dermal necrosis with underlying fibrin and inflammatory exudate but cellulitis with open skin lesions had chronic granulomatous/granulation tissue-type reaction associated with foreign material. A complete bacteriologic study was conducted on 25 of 37 birds. Bacteria were isolated from 12 of the 25 birds with cellulitis lesions. No aerobic, microaerophilic, or anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the remaining 13 birds with cellulitis lesions. Escherichia coli was isolated in low numbers in mixed cultures with Proteus mirabilis, Lactobacillus spp., Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in 9 of 12 lesions. The remaining few cases yielded P. mirabilis in pure culture or in mixed culture with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Types a and b cellulitis lesions in turkeys could be associated with primary contact dermatitis and skin abrasions, respectively. Their occurrence is likely associated with different management practices.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from European intensive care units: data from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme.
AB  - Susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 European ICUs participating in the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme (1997-2000). The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), Escherichia coli (19.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and Enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in Turkish, Russian and Italian ICUs (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). The frequency of AmpC-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. Meropenem was more active against Proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). Against Acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). Meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. Meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from European ICUs actively using meropenem.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. A Norwegian multicenter study.
AB  - From May to November 1997 each of six major hospitals throughout Norway collected 72 to 104 consecutive blood culture isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, altogether 563 isolates. Escherichia coli was the predominating organism (69%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (15%), Enterobacter spp. (6%), and Proteus mirabilis (4%). The susceptibility of the isolates to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, imipenem, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin was determined by the E-test. 37% and 7% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and cefuroxime, respectively, and 1% were resistant to ceftazidime and tobramycin. Only one isolate of P. mirabilis was imipenem resistant. All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates at each hospital varied from 21 to 45%, and of cefuroxime-resistant isolates from 3 to 9%. The results were compared with those of a similar study performed in 1991-1992. No significant changes in the susceptibility to the various agents could be demonstrated. The high frequency of isolates resistant to ampicillin has clearly limited the usefulness of this agent in the treatment of septicemia and other serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Single-dose fluoroquinolone therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing single-dose to 3-day fluoroquinolone regimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of single-dose and 3-day fluoroquinolone treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: Adult women with acute uncomplicated UTI were randomized to receive either a single dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), 3 days of gatifloxacin (200 mg daily), or 3 days of ciprofloxacin (100 mg twice daily). Patients were assessed at four points during the study: before treatment (within 48 hours before the initiation of the study medication), at the end of treatment (by telephone contact on day 3), and twice after treatment completion (5 to 9 days after treatment [test-of-cure visit] and 29 to 42 days after treatment [only patients with a bacteriologic response of eradication at the test-of-cure visit]). RESULTS: The bacterial eradication rate for the single-dose gatifloxacin, 3-day gatifloxacin, and 3-day ciprofloxacin groups was 90%, 95%, and 89%, respectively; the clinical efficacy rate was 93%, 95%, and 93%, respectively, for microbiologically assessable patients at the test-of-cure visit. Eradication of the most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, was achieved with gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Single-dose gatifloxacin was equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin in both microbiologic and clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose and 3-day gatifloxacin were microbiologically and clinically equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute UTI among women. Single-dose gatifloxacin may offer advantages over 3-day fluoroquinolone therapy for uncomplicated UTI by decreasing secondary use of medical resources and improving patient compliance.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Characterization of a new extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (TEM-87) isolated in Proteus mirabilis during an Italian survey.
AB  - A new natural TEM derivative, named TEM-87, was identified in a Proteus mirabilis isolate from an Italian hospital. Compared to TEM-1, TEM-87 contains the following mutations: E104K, R164C, and M182T. Kinetic analysis of TEM-87 revealed extended-spectrum activity against oxyimino cephalosporins (preferentially ceftazidime) and aztreonam. Expression of blaTEM-87 in Escherichia coli decreased the host susceptibility to these drugs.
TI  - The migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over Foley catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of Foley catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. The sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms on the agar on the other side of the bridges. A collection of swarming, swimming and nonmotile species were tested in the model. The relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. RESULTS: The swarmer cells of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris migrated successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. The migration index of Serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. Indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. The mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). The swarmer cells of P. mirabilis moved through populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. They were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus over the catheters. The migration index of P. mirabilis swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa and S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. With the exception of S. marcescens, the incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. Swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and P. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. This suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus O-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. To reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. This study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% o-phenylphenol. METHODS: The organisms used were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228), and from our clinical collection (Proteus mirabilis CH 14, Klebsiella oxytoca CH 22, Serratia liquefaciens CH 90). MIC and MBC were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. The contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. RESULTS: The results showed that MIC values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. The MBC values were similar or higher than the MIC. The disinfectant solution killed E. coli and C. albicans already after 10 min, but for S. aureus 30 min was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that this solution attained the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - Novel bacterial membrane surface display system using cell wall-less L-forms of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - We describe a novel membrane surface display system that allows the anchoring of  foreign proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) of stable, cell wall-less L-form cells of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The reporter protein, staphylokinase (Sak), was fused to transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins from E. coli (lactose permease LacY, preprotein translocase SecY) and P. mirabilis (curved cell morphology protein CcmA). Both L-form strains overexpressed fusion proteins in amounts of 1 to 100 microg ml(-1), with higher expression for those with homologous anchor motifs. Various experimental approaches, e.g., cell fractionation, Percoll gradient purification, and solubilization of the CM, demonstrated that the fusion proteins are tightly bound to the CM and do not form aggregates. Trypsin digestion, as well as electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled replicas, confirmed that the protein was localized on the outside surface. The displayed Sak showed functional activity, indicating correct folding. This membrane surface display system features endotoxin-poor organisms and can provide a novel platform for numerous applications.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: TRUST and TSN data for the United States. Tracking Resistance in the United States Today. The Surveillance Network.
AB  - From January to May 2000, as part of the Tracking Resistance in the United States Today (TRUST) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative Gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the United States. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. In addition, data for the same period were collected from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the US. Both surveillance methods produced similar results. Against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by TRUST and TSN surveillance. TRUST identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. Isolates of P. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). Other results from TRUST included Pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). Imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, TRUST; 87.4% susceptible, TSN) against Acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. S. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). Against 513 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli in TRUST, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. Age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. Similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. TRUST and TSN data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. TRUST centralized in vitro and electronic (TSN) surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.
TI  - Sudden increase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial strains with broad host range transfer of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - We investigated transfer of antibiotic resistance from 51 multiply resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from seriously ill patients in the Frankfurt University Clinics. Nine isolates directly transferred resistance to three recipient strains used. Ticarcillin and cephalothin resistance determinants were accepted from eight isolates, and in one case a kanamycin resistance determinant was transferred. The total spectrum of resistance transferred demonstrated that several donor strains transferred a different set of resistance determinants to all three recipient strains. Two P. aeruginosa isolates transferred spectrum of seven resistance determinants including ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam, three isolates transferred five determinants and four isolates transferred four resistance determinants. The fact that identical spectra of multiple drug resistance were transferred to recipient strains belonging to three different species (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa), indicates a broad host range in all three transferable genetic elements not observed in previous transfers from P. aeruginosa strains.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new diazoimidazole derivatives containing an N-acylpyrrolidine ring.
AB  - A series of 4-diazoimidazole-5-carboxamides bearing in position 2 lipophilic substituents was synthesized and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against pathogenic Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Some compounds presented antifungal activity, particularly two derivatives (1g and 1h) showed good MIC values (10-50 microg/ml) against both moulds and yeasts.
TI  - Occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Italy: implications for resistance to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial drugs.
AB  - An Italian nationwide survey was carried out to assess the prevalences and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Over a 6-month period, 8,015 isolates were obtained from hospitalized patients and screened for resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams. On the basis of a synergistic effect between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefepime, and ceftriaxone), 509 isolates were found to be ESBL positive (6.3%). Colony blot hybridization with bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) DNA probes allowed one to distinguish four different genotypes: TEM-positive, SHV-positive, TEM- and SHV-positive, and non-TEM, non-SHV ESBL types. MICs for each isolate (E-test) were obtained for widely used beta-lactams, combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Among ESBL-positive strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli accounted for 73.6% of isolates. Overall, TEM-type ESBLs were more prevalent than SHV-type enzymes (234 versus 173), whereas the prevalence of strains producing both TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs was similar to that of isolates producing non-TEM, non-SHV enzymes (55 and 38, respectively). In vitro, all but one of the ESBL-producing isolates remained susceptible to imipenem. Susceptibility to other drugs varied: piperacillin-tazobactam, 91%; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 85%; cefoxitin, 78%; amikacin, 76%; ampicillin-sulbactam, 61%; ciprofloxacin, 58%; and gentamicin, 56%. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin was observed most frequently among TEM-positive strains. Since therapeutic options for multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae are limited, combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors appear to represent an important alternative for treating infections caused by ESBL-producing ENTEROBACTERIACEAE:
TI  - Retrospective study of children with acute pyelonephritis. Evaluation of bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging studies.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a large Italian pediatric population. A total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were considered. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to ceftazidime. Despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%) children. A prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p < 0.0001). Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. The number of renal abnormalities detected by DMSA in patients with and without reflux was significantly different (p < 0.001). CRP was higher in patients with scars (p < 0.02). In conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500 days of hospitalization per year in the Veneto Region where there is a pediatric population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. The results of antimicrobial in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the antibiotic of choice. The high frequency of malformations, observed even in children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study including DMSA scan and VCUG in all age groups.
TI  - TEM-89 beta-lactamase produced by a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate: new complex mutant (CMT 3) with mutations in both TEM-59 (IRT-17) and TEM-3.
AB  - TEM-89 (CMT-3) is the first complex mutant beta-lactamase produced by a clinical  strain of Proteus mirabilis (strain Pm 631). This new enzyme, which has a pI of 6.28, is derived from TEM-3 and has a single amino acid substitution also encountered in TEM-59 (inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase IRT-17): Ser-130 to Gly. TEM-89 hydrolyzed penicillins to the same extent that TEM-3 did but lost almost all hydrolytic activity for cephalosporins and, like TEM-59, was highly resistant to inhibitors.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) at intervals for up to 144 h. Ofloxacin showed higher concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. The median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens for which the MICs of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; Escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. Generally, the UBTs for gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the UBTs for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. According to the UBTs, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (MICs, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. Although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for the detection of bacterial ATP (Coral, USA). Of these samples, 49% were reported to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were E. coli (47%), Proteus mirabilis (7%), Enterococcus faecalis (6%) and K. pneumoniae (5%). The susceptibility studies showed 37% E. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. Seven strains of E. coli produced ESBL. Thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. Resistance to nitrofurantoin in K. pneumoniae was 38%. P. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% Staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. E. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. Fosfomycin continued to show high activity against Gram-negative bacilli. However, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. ESBL were detected in the isolates of E. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
TI  - [Massive pleural empyema caused by pyonephrosis].
AB  - The pleural empyema has unusual origin at extralung causes. Then, is essential to identify the primary process in order to obtain the clinical setting control. Previously described, but even exceptional, this case report show an empyema in which it's origin was an asymtomatic pyonephrosis, caused because of a big kidney calculus and it's discovery was suspected by the bacillus results. The treatment must include appropriate antibiotic therapy and thoracic drainage, and also the drain of the purulent accumulations at the kidney and perikidney area.
TI  - Enzymatic characterization of TEM-63, a TEM-type extended spectrum beta-lactamase expressed in three different genera of Enterobacteriaceae from South Africa.
AB  - The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, TEM-63, was identified in three separate genera of South African isolates: Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. This paper describes identification of the gene in these isolates and compares relative rates of hyrolysis between TEM-63 and other known ceftazidimases.
TI  - Gram-negative bacterial toe web infection: a survey of 123 cases from the district of Cagliari, Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot intertrigo is mostly caused by dermatophytes and yeasts, less frequently by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Nevertheless, the importance of polymicrobial infections and especially colonizations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause therapy problems in relation to antibiotic resistance and the risk of potentially lethal complications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the main epidemiologic and clinical features of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria, the function of promoting factors, and the measures taken to treat and prevent this disorder. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1998, 123 cases of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria were observed at the Cagliari University Dermatology Department. Routine clinical and blood examinations, repeated bacterioscopic and mycologic examinations, cultures aimed at identifying the responsible bacteria, and antibiograms were performed. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was found to be the prevailing pathogen, both alone and associated with other gram-negative bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii) and gram-positive bacteria. Clinical manifestations were similar in the majority of patients: erythema, vesicopustules, erosions, and marked maceration caused by abundant, malodorous exudate. Lesions affected the interdigital spaces of both feet and frequently extended to the planta and the back of the toes. Patients complained of burning and pain. Successful therapies were achieved with combined topical and systemic treatment; to avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance, the choice of the active antibiotic was guided by antibiograms. CONCLUSION: In all symptomatic toe web infections, the presence of gram-negative germs, such as P aeruginosa, should be investigated to avoid the risk of treatment failures and more severe local or systemic complications.
TI  - Isolation of yeasts and enteric bacteria in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and role of yeasts, enteric gram-negative rods and Enterococcus species in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis, and the antimicrobial effect of iodine potassium iodide (IKI) irrigation. METHODOLOGY: Forty symptom-free root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. In group A the canals were filled with calcium hydroxide for 10-14 days after cleaning and shaping; in group B the canals were irrigated with IKI for 5 min after cleaning and shaping followed by a permanent root filling. Microbiological samples were taken from the canals before and after the chemomechanical preparation and after iodine irrigation (group B). RESULTS: Microbes were isolated from 33 of 40 teeth in the initial sampling. Yeasts were isolated from six teeth, three of them together with E. faecalis. Enteric rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis) were present in three teeth and E. faecalis was isolated from 21 of the 33 culture positive teeth, 11 in pure culture. Growth was detected in 10 teeth of the second samples. Six of the 10 cases were E. faecalis, with five being a pure culture. All third samples (after IKI) except one were negative. The number of microbial cells per sample did not correlate with lesion size. Two flare-ups were recorded, both in teeth with a mixed infection. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of enteric bacteria and yeasts in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis was established. IKI improved the antimicrobial effect of the treatment.
TI  - [Experimental study of photodynamic effect on bacterial wound microflora].
AB  - The in vitro study of the influence of photodynamic action (with the use of photosensitizer "Photosens", laser and non-laser irradiation) on the strains of the main representatives purulent wound microflora was carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis cultures have been isolated from wound secretions and identified. The photosensitizer was shown to produce no bactericidal effect by itself. Irradiation with laser and non-laser light sources induced a sharp decrease in the number of viable cells in the cultures under study. The irradiation of the photosensitizer led to its activation, manifested in bactericidal action. The results thus obtained confirm good prospect of using photodynamic therapy for the treatment of purulent wounds.
TI  - CMY-2-producing Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains isolated in Spain (October 1999-December 2000).
AB  - CMY-2 plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of Spain between October 1999 and December 2000. The isolates comprised two Salmonella enterica serovars (Mikawasima and Montevideo), 16 Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis. In addition to the expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. All were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. Five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred CMY-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. Genomic DNA restriction pattern analysis of the E. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that CMY-2 has been detected in P. mirabilis, K. oxytoca and S. enterica serovars Mikawasima and Montevideo. It is also the first time that CMY-2 has been described in Spain.
TI  - Repression of bacterial motility by a novel fimbrial gene product.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a common uropathogen in patients with long-term catheterization or with structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract. The mannose-resistant, Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae and flagellum are among virulence factors of P.mirabilis that contribute to its colonization in a murine model of ascending urinary tract infection. mrpJ, the last of nine genes of the mrp operon, encodes a 107 amino acid protein that contains a putative helix-turn-helix domain. Using transcriptional lacZ fusions integrated into the chromosome and mutagenesis studies, we demonstrate that MrpJ represses transcription of the flagellar regulon and thus reduces flagella synthesis when MR/P fimbriae are produced. The repression of flagella synthesis by MrpJ is confirmed by electron microscopy. However, a gel mobility shift assay indicates that MrpJ does not bind directly to the regulatory region of the flhDC operon. The isogenic mrpJ null mutant of wild-type P.mirabilis strain HI4320 is attenuated in the murine model. Our data also indicate that PapX encoded by a pap (pyelonephritis- associated pilus) operon of uropathogenic Escherichia coli is a functional homolog of MrpJ.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the Escherichia coli Tus protein: DNA-protein interactions alone can not account for Tus activity.
AB  - The Tus protein of Escherichia coli is capable of arresting DNA replication in an orientation-dependent manner when bound to specific sequences in the bacterial chromosome called Ter sites. Arrest of DNA replication has been postulated to occur either by a barrier mechanism, where Tus acts as a physical block to replication fork progression, or through protein-protein interactions between Tus and some component of the replication fork. A previous mutational analysis of Tus suggested that the amino acids in the L1 loop might play a role in replication arrest. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the L1 loop and other amino acid residues on the "non-permissive" face of Tus was performed to identify residues that affected Tus function. One mutant, E47Q, gave results that are inconsistent with the barrier model, showing a greater affinity for the Ter site (with a t 1/2 of 348 min versus 150 min for wild-type Tus) but a reduced ability to arrest DNA replication in vivo. In addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the tus genes of Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Yersinia were sequenced and the proteins expressed in E. coli to assess their ability to arrest DNA replication. The results presented here support a role for protein-protein interactions in Tus function, and suggest that residues E47 and E49 participate in replication fork arrest.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens isolated from female outpatients across the US in 1999.
AB  - In the United States, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females, in regions with resistance rates of <10-20%. Unfortunately, current data on regional resistance is often not readily available to physicians and regional variability in resistance remains largely unknown. This report presents antimicrobial susceptibility data for TMP-SMX and three other commonly tested antimicrobials organized by state and region to demonstrate current regional variability in resistance in the US. In the last quarter of 1999, 5739 fresh clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were collected from 202 laboratories throughout the US. Susceptibility testing was performed against TMP-SMX, cephalothin, nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin using broth microdilution. Data were analyzed by patient age and specimen source, and by state and region. In the US as a whole, resistance to TMP-SMX was 16.8% for E. coli, 7.8% for K. pneumoniae, 12.1% for P. mirabilis and 3.0% for S. saprophyticus, but these rates showed considerable regional variation. By state, E. coli resistance ranged from 7.4% in Pennsylvania to 33.3% in Iowa (among states with > or =50 isolates tested). Regionally, resistance for all uropathogens taken together ranged from 8.5% in East South-Central to 22.8% in West South-Central. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated the broadest activity of the antimicrobials tested and was more active than TMP-SMX against all pathogens. Resistance to TMP-SMX among E. coli now approaches or exceeds 20% in some areas. As resistance among uropathogens reaches clinically significant levels in many areas, continued regional surveillance is essential to ensure the provision of effective empiric therapy for urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 499 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and Gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. The increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was also strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA. However, MSSA and MRSA showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). Carbapenems showed high activities against Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. Meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Quinolone resistant E. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. MEPM and carumonam (CRMN) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. On the other hand, one strain of K. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (CCL) and one strain of P. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Epidemiology and frequency of resistance among pathogens causing urinary tract infections in 1,510 hospitalized patients: a report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America).
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are an important cause of septicemia resulting in high mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. Periodic reviews of pathogen frequency and susceptibility patterns impact on appropriate antimicrobial usage, leading to more effective prescribing practices. As part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (SENTRY, 1998), participants collected 50 consecutive UTI pathogens from patients hospitalized in 31 medical centers (26 in the United States and five in Canada) and forwarded subcultures to the coordinating center. Thirty-four antimicrobial agents were tested including two investigational compounds (quinupristin/dalfopristin [Q/D], gatifloxacin). The rank order of the 32 species identified during the study was: Escherichia coli (46.9%) > Enterococcus spp. (12.8%) > Klebsiella spp. (11.0%) > Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%) > Proteus mirabilis (5.0%) > coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 3.4%). This pathogen rank order did not change from 1997 to 1998, but resistance patterns changed. Clonal spread of confirmed extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains was not observed, but co-resistance was elevated for aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones. P. aeruginosa was most susceptible to amikacin (97.3%) > piperacillin +/- tazobactam (92.0-95.6%) > cefepime = imipenem (91.2%) > ceftazidime (85.8%). Fluoroquinolone resistance was greater in P. aeruginosa (24.8-39.8%) > P. mirabilis (5.3-13.3%) > Enterobacter spp. (6.7-8.9%) > Klebsiella spp. (4.2-7.8%) > E. coli (3.0-3.8%). Only 5% of enterococci were resistant to vancomycin. These results emphasize the need for continued surveillance studies for common infections which establish baseline resistance patterns by geographic areas, and have the potential to detect epidemics or direct local epidemiologic interventions.
TI  - [Determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata (Griseb.) Epling].
AB  - The in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV). The viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. The antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects PrV and HSV-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells were observed at the concentrations assayed. The therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for HSV-1 and PrV, respectively. The antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil of M. verticillata was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) technique. Of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. The antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. Results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define the mechanisms of action are warranted.
TI  - Dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  - Dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. Education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. Manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. Dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within DUWs. These methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. In order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. There are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. However, the Food and Drug Administration have not approved all products currently on the market. Our evaluation of Zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. It is also economical and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. Following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the DUWs was free from any viable microorganisms. This effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. The elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the DUWs was performed. Although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of DUWs following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. Finally, the product can be delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. From our study, Zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. Based on the research that has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. A combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality dental treatment water. Independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ADA, OSAP, and CDC guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. It is expected that in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems and products to deal with this issue. Until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in DUWs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Alstonia macrophylla: a folklore of bay islands.
AB  - The methanolic crude and methanol-aqueous extract of Alstonia macrophylla leaves  and n-butanol part of the crude extract showed antimicrobial activity against various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranges from 64 to 1000 microg/ml for bacteria and 32-128 mg/ml for dermatophytes. However, the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp. and Vibrio cholerae showed resistance against in vitro treatment of the extracts up to 2000 microg/ml concentration, while the two yeast species were resistant even at 128 mg/ml concentration. The stem bark extract prepared similarly was found to be less active compared to the leaves. Phytochemical study indicates that the crude extract contains tannins, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, triterpene and reducing sugars. Further fractionation and purification of n-butanol part of the extract showed the presence of beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol glucoside and a mixture of minor compounds only detected in TLC.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Escherichia coli eradication from the blader urine by amoxicillin-sulbactam. Intrinsic activity of the inhibitor].
AB  - RATIONALE: At urine concentrations obtained after the oral administration of amoxicillin-sulbactam (500/500 mg) this combination inhibits roughly 90% of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains. AIMS: To administer amoxicilin-sulbactam 875/125 mg and to determine: a) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of sulbactam for E. coli and P. mirabilis; b) urine inhibitory titres power (UIT) against amoxicillin-resistant E. coli or P. mirabilis; c) urine concentrations of sulbactam; and to verify whether sulbactam 125 mg as single drug, attains a high enough UIT to support the intrinsic action of the inhibitor; and to compare the activity of amoxicillin-sulbactam and amoxicillin-clavulanate and that of sulbactam and clavulanate. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of amoxicillin-sulbactam 875/125 mg or amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg, according to a randomized cross-over design. Urine samples were drawn at: 0 (basal), 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Urine pH, specific gravidity and UIP were assessed. Thirty nine strains isolated from urine samples were used: 30 TEM-1 producing E. coli strains and 3 extended spectrum CTX-M-2 betalactamase-producing E. coli; and 6 P. mirabilis resistant to both combinations. In 6 healthy volunteers, sulbactam 125 mg was administered orally and UIT against E. coli (MIC amoxicillin > 2048 mg/l) was assessed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: MIC-90 for amoxicillin plus sulbactam or clavulanate were similar to those for sulbactam or clavulanate alone, without any difference attributable to the chemical composition of the urine. The activity of amoxicillin plus the inhibitors could be due, not only to the inhibition of betalactamase but also to the intrinsic effect of the inhibitor. Both combinations showed an equivalent inhibitory activity. Two-hour UIT remained high for the entire 6-h evaluation period. Sulbactam concentration far exceed sulbactam MIC for the 6h-period, inhibiting urine E. coli. We disagree with the cut-off limit proposed for intermediate values of NCCLS, which, for these antimicrobial are 16/8, a value lower than those obtained in urine samples after the administration of betalactamase inhibitors. This may be an explanation for the beneficial effect of amoxicillin-sulbactam in the recovery of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women when the involved strains were considered resistant by diffusional methods.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in South Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was carried out at a General Practice in South Trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. METHODS: Quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. Identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. Susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: From 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. Three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. Most males above 50 years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by Proteus mirabilis, 9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. All urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for Citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. The ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. Also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent resistance in bacterial isolates from patients with diarrhea  and urinary tract infection in the Sudan.
AB  - Antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed on four-hundred and ninety-seven bacterial isolates from Sudanese patients with diarrhea or urinary tract infections. Shigella dysenteriae type I and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli showed high resistance rates (percentage of isolates showing antibiotic resistance) against the commonly-used antimicrobial agents: ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, sulfonamide, and neomycin, and were completely sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Eighteen resistance patterns against nine antimicrobial agents tested were observed in enteric pathogens. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and sulfonamide was the most frequent pattern. The common urinary pathogens, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis showed high rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, sulfonamide, trimethoprim, streptomycin, and carbenicillin. We recommend that physicians seek updated knowledge of the common antibiotic-sensitivity patterns when starting empirical antibiotic therapy in Sudanese patients with diarrhea or urinary tract infection.
TI  - [Increased antibacterial activity of antibiotics with etonium in vitro].
AB  - The activity of compositions of antibiotics cefasolin, benzylpenicillin and gentamycin with etonium in respect to museum strains Staphylococcus aureus 209, Escherichia coli K-12, Proteus vulgaris 410, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19, Klebsiella pneumoniae 5054 and polyresistance strains S. aureus, E. coli, P. mirabilis in vitro was researched. The increase of the compositions activity as a result of synergy in the action of their component 4 up to 4496 times has been established.
TI  - The development of the BSAC standardized method of disc diffusion testing.
AB  - The BSAC Working Party on Susceptibility Testing has developed a standardized method of disc susceptibility testing that has been 'field tested' in 19 diagnostic laboratories in the UK and Ireland. The method employs semi-defined media, a semi-confluent inoculum and relates zones of inhibition with BSAC-specified MIC breakpoints to interpret susceptibility. The bacteria selected for the trial included clinical isolates and control strains from the ATCC and NCTC national collections. Organisms were chosen because they had known attributes, such as being fully susceptible or having a demonstrated mechanism of resistance. The results from this survey are very encouraging. With the commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae, specifically Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp., no major problems were observed except with gentamicin and cefuroxime. In the case of gentamicin, problems were associated with resistant strains of P. mirabilis, with MICs of 2 mg/L, being falsely reported as susceptible. For cefuroxime, it is not unexpected that results were unreliable, as the MIC distribution straddles the in vitro breakpoint concentration (following the results of this study the MIC and zone diameter breakpoints have been amended to improve reporting). No major problems were encountered for Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the agents studied. The 'field survey' has shown that disc testing is unreliable for determining the susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci to teicoplanin, and that the detection of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is improved by incubation for a full 24 h. Inconsistencies observed with fastidious organisms were associated with incorrect inocula. Zone diameter data for the control strains studied provide information that can be utilized by diagnostic laboratories to monitor the daily performance of testing.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity in normal and diseased captive bustards.
AB  - A survey was carried out to describe the normal aerobic bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity of captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata), kori bustards (Ardeotis kori), and white-bellied bustards (Eupodotis senegalensis) maintained at the National Avian Research Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. A total of 58 samples were examined from the nasal cavity and 55 samples from the conjunctiva of healthy bustards. There was no bacterial growth in 45% of conjunctival samples. Bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of healthy birds included Micrococcus spp., Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus warneri, Bacillus spp., and Enterobacter amigenus. Bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of healthy birds included Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., S. auricularis, S. xylosus, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus sciuri, Aerococcus spp., and Providencia rettgeri. These findings were compared with bacterial isolates from bustards with clinical signs of ocular or upper respiratory tract diseases. Mycoplasma spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of 34.3% bustards with ocular discharges. Mycoplasma spp., P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of 74% bustards with upper respiratory tract diseases.
TI  - Tissue antioxidant capacity and bacterial translocation under total parenteral nutrition.
AB  - Alterations in the antioxidative system have been observed during total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Light exposure or changes in the composition of TPN formulas may affect this system. Bacterial translocation (BT) is frequent under TPN and may be related to oxidative status. The aim of this study was to determine the adverse effects of standard and glutamine-enriched TPN, with or without light exposure, on oxidative status (liver and kidney-reduced glutathione, GSH) and its relationship to BT. Thirty-three adult Wistar rats underwent central-venous cannulation and were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving different TPN regimes for 10 days. The TPN group (n = 10) had standard TPN, the TPN(-) group (n = 8) standard TPN without light exposure, the GTPN group (n = 8) glutamine-enriched TPN, and the GTPN(-) group (n = 7) glutamine-enriched TPN without light exposure. A sham group (n = 16) receiving chow and water ad libitum and saline i.v. served as controls. At the end of the experiment, GSH was determined in liver and kidney tissue. Mesenteric lymph nodes and peripheral and portal blood samples were cultured for BT. Compared to sham rats, TPN groups had statistically significant lower GSH levels, but there were no differences between standard or glutamine-enriched groups or light-exposure groups. Sham animals had 12% BT. Significantly higher BT (P < 0.05) occurred in TPN rats: 70% in the TPN group, 88% in the TPN(-) group, 86% in GTPN (-) animals, and only 50% in the GTPN group (P = 0.06 vs TPN group). In conclusion, (1) TPN reduces antioxidant capacity; (2) glutamine supplementation or light protection does not improve tissue antioxidant capacity under TPN; (3) the absence of light exposure does not improve TPN-related BT; and (4) glutamine supplementation tends to reduce BT only in the presence of light.
TI  - [Effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. Thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.
TI  - Novel type of fimbriae encoded by the large plasmid of sorbitol-fermenting enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H(-).
AB  - Sorbitol-fermenting (SF) enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H(-) have emerged as important causes of diarrheal diseases and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome in Germany. In this study, we characterized a 32-kb fragment of the plasmid of SF EHEC O157:H(-), pSFO157, which differs markedly from plasmid pO157 of classical non-sorbitol-fermenting EHEC O157:H7. We found a cluster of six genes, termed sfpA, sfpH, sfpC, sfpD, sfpJ, and sfpG, which mediate mannose-resistant hemagglutination and the expression of fimbriae. sfp genes are similar to the pap genes, encoding P-fimbriae of uropathogenic E. coli, but the sfp cluster lacks homologues of genes encoding subunits of a tip fibrillum as well as regulatory genes. The major pilin, SfpA, despite its similarity to PapA, does not cluster together with known PapA alleles in a phylogenetic tree but is structurally related to the PmpA pilin of Proteus mirabilis. The putative adhesin gene sfpG, responsible for the hemagglutination phenotype, shows significant homology neither to papG nor to other known sequences. Sfp fimbriae are 3 to 5 nm in diameter, in contrast to P-fimbriae, which are 7 nm in diameter. PCR analyses showed that the sfp gene cluster is a characteristic of SF EHEC O157:H(-) strains and is not present in other EHEC isolates, diarrheagenic E. coli, or other Enterobacteriaceae. The sfp gene cluster is flanked by two blocks of insertion sequences and an origin of plasmid replication, indicating that horizontal gene transfer may have contributed to the presence of Sfp fimbriae in SF EHEC O157:H(-).
TI  - Integrin expression, enterocyte maturation, and bacterial internalization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the translocation of enteric bacteria. Adhesion molecules mediate interactions between some enteric pathogens and mammalian cells, but no such interactions have been identified for enterocytes and normal enteric bacteria. Using enteric pathogens, adhesion molecule expression has been linked to bacterial internalization and to enterocyte differentiation. Therefore, experiments were designed to study enterocyte integrin expression and differentiation, as well as enterocyte internalization of Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relative expression of the alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrin subunits on Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes (mature and immature) was measured by ELISA. Bacteria-enterocyte surface interactions were observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial internalization by enterocytes was quantified using the gentamicin protection assay. RESULTS: Expression of the alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrin subunits was consistently increased in immature compared to mature Caco-2 enterocytes; however, compared to mature enterocytes, immature HT-29 enterocytes had similar expression of alpha3 and beta1 but decreased alpha2. Compared to untreated mature enterocytes, bacterial internalization was increased in immature enterocytes as well as mature enterocytes with lateral membranes artifactually exposed. However, there was no difference in bacterial internalization between immature enterocytes and mature enterocytes treated to expose the lateral membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial internalization by enterocytes appeared to be due to factors other than integrin expression or enterocyte differentiation. Exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane may play an important role in facilitating bacterial internalization by enterocytes.
TI  - Biogenic amines produced by Enterobacteriaceae isolated from meat products.
AB  - Biogenic amines in ground meat and processed meat products are one of the indicators to determine the poor quality raw material. Major histamine forming bacterium was Escherichia coli (strain EC04 with 65.88 mg/100 ml in Brain Heart Infusion medium), followed by the microorganisms Morganella morganii (strain MM4 with 8.40 mg/100 ml and strain MM7 with 8.28 mg/100 ml) and Proteus mirabilis (strain PM02 with 8.76 mg/100 ml), respectively. The highest putrescine production level was found in Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter spp. strains, followed by Serratia grimesii, Proteus alcalifaciens, E. coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri and Hafnia alvei, respectively. The most important cadaverine producer was E. coli EC03 with a production level of 45.48 mg/100 ml, and of the strains Escherichia vulnaris EV01, Escherichia fergusonii EF06 produced 37.92 mg/100ml and 35.40 mg/100 ml, respectively. On the basis of our results, it can be concluded that the major biogenic amines produced by Enterobacteriaceae are putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and histamine, both in culture medium and meat products.
TI  - Phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  - Utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  Enterobacteriaceae. The results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the members of these species. The genomic hybridization of selected Enterobacteriaceae members with the Escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in Shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to E. coli. However, the Salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglR and bglG regions and the deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. Similarly, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglR and bglG regions and deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. The homolog of the cel operon could be identified in S. sonnei and Salmonella groups of organisms. Possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in Klebsiella pneumoniae C3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to Escherichia coli K-12. The recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coaD genes, as was found in E. coli K-12. PCR amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative K. pneumoniae strains. Partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. Complementation analysis of known waa mutants from E. coli K-12 and/or Salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the Enterobacteriaceae. K. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. Analysis of a constructed K. pneumoniae waaE deletion mutant suggests that the WaaE protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-D-Glc to the O-4 position of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose I, a feature shared by K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - The influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine T.
AB  - The phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of N-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine T for comparison. Chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (N-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine T: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). Killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in Staphylococcus aureus. With chloramine T, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. The chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of activated C-H compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of N-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. The initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. The increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal N-chloro compounds by which the loss of N-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.
TI  - [Phosphatase from Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - Cell-free preparations of Proteus mirabilis contained a phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), whose activity surpassed that of alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli. Phosphatase was also found in the culture liquid of P. mirabilis. The composition of proteins displaying enzyme activity was assayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme synthesis was studied at various stages of bacterial growth. Biosynthesis of phosphatase in P. mirabilis (similarly to that in other bacteria) was shown to be induced under conditions of inorganic phosphate deficiency in the medium.
TI  - Antibiotic selective pressure and development of bacterial resistance.
AB  - This study evaluates the development of resistance in Gram-negative rods to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and amikacin, meropenem and ampicillin/sulbactam over a five year period of use (1994-1998) at the University Hospital in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The development of bacterial resistance was linked with antibiotic use and hence selective pressure which was specific for the type of antibiotic and the bacterial species. Statistically significant correlations were found for the use of ofloxacin and resistance in Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri; cefotaxime and Enterobacter cloacae; ceftazidime and Acinetobacter spp., Enterobacter agglomerans and Proteus vulgaris; and gentamicin and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in multiresistant nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii strains from seven clinics in the Slovak and Czech Republics.
AB  - Sixty-seven multiresistant nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from patients hospitalized mostly in intensive care units of seven clinics in Slovak and Czech Republic were tested to determine their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance. All isolates were resistant to kanamycin, ticarcillin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and susceptible to carbapenems, sulbactam and ampicillin/sulbactam. Sixty-five out of 67 strains transferred resistance determinants to Escherichia coli K-12 and Proteus mirabilis P-38 recipients. Analysis of selected transconjugants by an indirect selection method showed a more variable pattern of transferred resistance determinants. The clonal spread of strains transferring resistance seems to be an additional risk for occurrence of strains resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam.
TI  - Evidence of in vivo transfer of a plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 and other resistance factors among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The epidemiological study of several multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from five patients demonstrated in vivo dissemination of a 100-kb plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 from a clonal strain of Enterobacter aerogenes to different strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Variations in the prevalence of strains expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype and characterization of isolates from Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific region.
AB  - To evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains among species of Enterobacteriaceae, a microdilution susceptibility test was performed with strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella species that were isolated as part of the SENTRY project. The highest percentage of ESBL phenotype (defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] > or =2 microg/mL for ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or aztreonam) was detected among K. pneumoniae strains from Latin America (45%), followed by those from the Western Pacific region (25%), Europe (23%), the United States (8%), and Canada (5%). P. mirabilis and E. coli strains for which MICs of extended-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams were elevated also were more prominent in Latin America. Testing with ceftazidime revealed more isolates with elevated MICs than did testing with ceftriaxone or aztreonam. ESBL strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Imipenem remains highly effective against ESBL strains. Organisms expressing an ESBL are widely distributed worldwide, although prevalence rates are significantly higher in certain geographic regions.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - Comparison of the PR mutant with the wild-type strain of proteus mirabilis brings insight into peroxide resistance factors and regulation of catalase expression.
AB  - The peroxide resistant mutant (PR) of Proteus mirabilis was characterized by an increased constitutive catalase activity concomitant with a large production of specific mRNA. Survival toward hydrogen peroxide during exponential phase was increased by H2O2 pretreatment in the wild type but not in the mutant, although the catalase of both strains was not inducible under these conditions. In the mutant, besides catalase, over-produced proteins comprised two different alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC) proteins and a protein homologous to the stationary phase transcription factor SspA of Escherichia coli. Conversely, the flagellin A (FlaA) of P. mirabilis was repressed in the PR mutant. Genomic DNA fragments of 2.9 kb carrying the catalase gene (katA) together with the 5' and 3' flanking regions were isolated from both strains and found to be identical. Upstream of katA, a Fur box-like sequence was found, but surprisingly, restricting iron in the culture medium caused a decrease in catalase production. The PR mutant presents similarities with other peroxide resistant mutants, but the regulation of catalase biosynthesis in P. mirabilis seems somewhat different from other close species such as E. coli.
TI  - [The role of urinary tract infections in burn patients].
AB  - Patients with burns are predisposed to a variety of infectious complications, urinary tract infections inclusive. It is the aim of the study to assay the incidence rate, etiology and antibacterial sensitivity of the leading pathogens causing bacteriuria in burnt patients, and compare them with the respective characteristics of the pathogens causing wound infection in the same contingent of patients, and urinary tract infection in uro-nephrological patients. Over a five-year period, a total of 2452 urines and 4236 wound exudates from 963 patients with burns, and 8800 urines from 2908 uro-nephrological patients are studied. In 35.4 per cent of patients positivation of 29.2 per cent of the urines being examined is noted. The major causing agents producing bacteriuria in burns--E. coli (19.2%) and Proteus mirabilis (13.9%)--are similar to the ones found in uro-nephrological patients, and differ from the causing agents of wound infection (the isolates concur in 16.7 per cent of the cases only). The inference is reached that strict monitoring of burnt patients is absolutely necessary because they run a high risk of urinary infection development, most frequently caused by multiresistant hospital strains, worsening the prognosis of either of the conditions. Monotherapy prescription with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, based on the sensitivity of isolates in vitro, is strongly recommended.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of urine after administration of ofloxacin for 5 days].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin was evaluated in urine over a period of 96 h after oral administration for 5 days of 200 mg twice a day in 12 healthy female volunteers. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of urines were studied for five strains of enterobacterias recovered from urinary infections: two strains of Escherichia Coli Nal-S and Nal-R, two strains of Proteus mirabilis Nal-S and Nal-R, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae Nal-S. Mean urinary concentrations of ofloxacin were very high during the first 12 h following last intake. They were still above 7 mg/l till the 48th hour and above 1.6 mg/l till the 72nd hour. Bactericidal activity of urine was present for 72 h in respect of four strains studied at that time; urine was not bactericidal as regards E. coli Nal-R. After 5 days of oral treatment with ofloxacin (200 mg b.i.d.), urine retains a bactericidal activity for at least 72 h against bacterial strains of urinary tract infections.
TI  - An intelligent rapid odour recognition model in discrimination of Helicobacter pylori and other gastroesophageal isolates in vitro.
AB  - Two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between Helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. In the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees C), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., H. pylori, Enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), Mixed infection (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and E. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. Fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (NN). The NN prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. Successful clustering of bacterial classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (DA) of a normalised subset of sensor data. Cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. In the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees C, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of H. pylori cultures in enriched (HPP) and normal (HP) media and 11 samples over sterile (N) cultures. Forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer NN previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (GA). GA-NN analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. Additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform DA-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. It is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of GA-NNs and multivariate techniques.
TI  - A survey of gram-negative bacteria survival on hospital fabrics and plastics.
AB  - One critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person to person  or from the environment to a person (patient or health care worker) is the ability of the microbe to survive on an environmental surface. The purpose of this study was to determine the length of survival of various gram-negative bacteria on fabrics and plastics commonly used in hospitals. Seven materials were tested: smooth cotton (clothing), cotton terry (towels), 60% cotton-40% polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), polyester (drapes), 75% nylon-25% spandex (pressure garments), polyvinyl (splash aprons), and polyurethane (keyboard covers). The following bacteria were tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter species, and Enterobacter species. Swatches of the materials were inoculated with defined amounts of bacteria and assayed at regular intervals. Survival was dependent on the bacterium, its inoculum size, and the material tested. At 102 microorganisms per swatch, bacteria survived from less than 1 hour to 8 days. At 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per swatch, survival ranged from 2 hours to more than 60 days. These findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and conscientious contact control procedures in areas that serve immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with burn injuries.
TI  - [Clinical experiences of endotoxin removal columns in septic shock due to urosepsis: report of three cases].
AB  - Clinical experiences of endotoxin removal using polymyxin B immobilized fiber column (PMX) in three septic shock patients are reported. The patients were referred to our hospital with complaints of high fever and severe pain during urination. Physical examination and laboratory data revealed severe hypotension, tachycardia, and pyuria. Diagnoses of septic shock due to urosepsis were made. After antibiotic therapy and anti-shock therapy, direct hemoperfusion using polymyxin B immobilized fiber column (PMX) was carried out. Thereafter, cardiovascular instabilities were improved without increasing the supply of catecholamines. PMX therapy for systemic inflammatory response due to infection was effective in treatment of cardiovascular instabilities.
TI  - Influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  - The available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. Nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. In this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. Bacterial counts were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. A total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. An increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of S. aureus. The largest average growth increase was obtained with E. coli. The largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with S. marcescens. Our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced by humen wet cerumen. In vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.
TI  - Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  - Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during October-December, 1999 was tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. METHODS: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli 87, Klebsiella pneumoniae 54, Pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, Staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant S. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive S. aureus 12), Acinetobacter species 26, Enterobacter aerogenes 9, Proteus mirabilis 5, Proteus vulgaris 2, and Citrobacter species 3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using NCCLS guidelines. The cut-off values of isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. RESULTS: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. Isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the other aminoglycosides tested. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.

TI  - Flagellin, a novel mediator of Salmonella-induced epithelial activation and systemic inflammation: I kappa B alpha degradation, induction of nitric oxide synthase, induction of proinflammatory mediators, and cardiovascular dysfunction.
AB  - Gram-negative sepsis is mediated by the actions of proinflammatory genes induced  in response to microbes and their products. We report that flagellin, the monomeric subunit of flagella, is a potent proinflammatory species released by Salmonella. Flagellin (1 microgram/ml) induces IkappaBalpha degradation, NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, and inducible NO synthase expression in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Aflagellic Salmonella mutants do not induce NF-kappaB activation or NO production by cultured IEC. Antiserum to flagellin blocks NO production in IEC induced by medium conditioned by a variety of motile Gram-negative enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella muenchen, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris). Flagellin, when injected systemically (approximately 10 microgram/mouse), induces systemic inflammation characterized by the systemic expression of a range of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and of inducible NO synthase. At higher doses (approximately 300 microgram/mouse), flagellin induces shock, characterized by hypotension, reduced vascular contractility in mice, and death. The effects of flagellin do not diminish in C3H/HeJ LPS-resistant mice, indicating that the Toll-like receptor-4 receptor is not involved in flagellin's actions. In LPS-resistant mice, i.p. injection of S. dublin flagellin or medium conditioned by wild-type S. dublin induces serum IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas medium conditioned by aflagellic mutants has no effect. Flagellin can be detected in the blood of rats with septic shock induced by live bacteria at approximately 1 microg/ml. We propose that flagellin released by Gram-negative pathogens may contribute to the inflammatory response by an LPS- and Toll-like receptor-4-independent pathway.
TI  - Conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoH of enteric bacteria.
AB  - The rpoH regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from GenBank and compared. In addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoH of Yersinia frederiksenii and Proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. Sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters P1, P4 and P5, to the sigma(E) promoter P3 and to boxes DnaA1, DnaA2, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) boxes CRP1, CRP2 and box CytR present in Escherichia coli K12, were identified in sequences of closely related bacteria such as: E.coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In more distant bacteria, Y.frederiksenii and P.mirabilis, the rpoH regulatory region has a distal P1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. Sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria. This study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoH gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. A second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to E.coli.
TI  - Clostridium difficile toxins A and B can alter epithelial permeability and promote bacterial paracellular migration through HT-29 enterocytes.
AB  - Clostridium difficile toxins A and B are the widely recognized etiologic agents of antibiotic-associated diseases ranging from diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. We hypothesized that C. difficile toxins may alter intestinal epithelial permeability and facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Experiments were designed to clarify the effects of C. difficile toxins A and B on the flux of inert particles across HT-29 enterocyte monolayers, and to correlate these results with bacteria-enterocyte interactions. In all experiments, mature, confluent HT-29 cultures were preincubated 16 h with toxin A or B (1-100 ng/mL). To study alterations in epithelial permeability, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 5 pM solutions of 10- and 40-kD inert dextran particles. Toxin A, but not toxin B, was associated with increased dextran flux through enterocyte monolayers. To study bacteria-enterocyte interactions, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 10(8) Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, or Escherichia coli. Although numbers of internalized bacteria were generally unaffected, both toxins were associated with increased bacterial adherence, as well as increased bacterial transmigration through enterocyte monolayers. Bacterial transmigration was significantly greater using toxin A- compared to toxin B-treated enterocytes, consistent with the observation that dextran flux was significantly greater using toxin A- compared to toxin B-treated enterocytes. Thus intestinal colonization with toxigenic C. difficile may facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelium by a mechanism involving increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to silver nitrate coated poly-L-lactic acid urological stents in vitro.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to see whether it is possible to prevent bacterial  adherence to bioabsorbable self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer (SR-PLLA) urological stents. The SR-PLLA stents were coated with silver nitrate blended epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide copolymer. The adherence of five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and two strains of Escherichia coli) to coated and non-coated SR-PLLA wires were tested. It was found that silver nitrate coating prevented the adherence of bacteria (except E. faecalis) to SR-PLLA stents. The preventive effect correlated with the silver nitrate concentration. It was also found that silver nitrate coating reduced the amount of bacteria in ambient urine. In conclusion, silver nitrate coating may reduce stent-associated bacterial infections by preventing the adherence of bacteria. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in clinical practice.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to ofloxacin-blended polylactone-coated self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer urological stents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ofloxacin coating has any effect on bacterial adherence to bioresorbable self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer (SR-PLLA) urological stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SR-PLLA stents were coated with epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide copolymer blended with ofloxacin at three different concentrations of ofloxacin (0.5, 2 and 5% w/w). The adherence of five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and two strains of Escherichia coli) to the coated SR-PLLA stents was analysed. Uncoated stent pieces were used as controls. The effect of ofloxacin coating on bacterial growth in the microenvironment of the stent pieces was also analysed. RESULTS: Ofloxacin coating prevented bacterial adherence to SR-PLLA stent material; this effect correlated significantly with the ofloxacin concentration of the caprolactone coating. Ofloxacin coating reduced the amount of bacteria in the microenvironment of the stent, but because of natural resistance, ofloxacin coating had little effect on E. faecalis. CONCLUSION: Except for E. faecalis, ofloxacin coating may reduce stent-associated infections. However, further studies are needed to confirm its biocompatibility and efficacy in clinical use.
TI  - Impact of fluoroquinolone administration on the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli from gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - We assessed the risk factors for acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms in the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients. We analyzed stool samples from 204 patients and recovered fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms from 63. Receipt of fluoroquinolone during the month preceding admission was the only risk factor identified, whereas female sex, duration of hospitalization, exposure to indwelling devices, admission from another hospital, and history of infection were risk factors for fecal colonization after day 4.
TI  - [Infectivity and resistance to antibiotics of uropathogenic gram-negative rods].
AB  - The nature of bacterial isolates from children with clinically suspected urinary  tract infections (UTI) was studied. The susceptibility of urinary pathogens to selected antibiotics was determined. The results clearly show that E. coli was identified as the main causative agent of UTI children (67% of isolates). The second commonest pathogen was P. mirabilis (10%). Over half E. coli isolates were resistant to amino-penicilins but almost all isolates (over 80%) were sensitive to antimicrobial agents combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors. We found significantly high percentage (32.5%) of ESBL strains among K. pneumoniae isolates.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - In vitro activity of gatifloxacin compared with gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against uropathogens cultured from patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gatifloxacin were compared with those of gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin using an agar dilution method for 400 uropathogens cultured from the urine of urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). The collection of strains was made up of Enterobacteriaceae (34.5%), enterococci (31.5%), staphylococci (21.2%) and non-fermenting bacteria (12.8%). The antibacterial activity of the three newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin, were similar, but showed some drug specific differences. Gemifloxacin was most active against Escherichia coli, but less so against Proteus mirabilis. In this series all isolates of E. coli were inhibited at a MIC of 0.25 mg/l gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin and by 0.125 mg/l gemifloxacin. The MIC distribution of all fluoroquinolones showed a bimodal distribution for staphylococci, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The two modes for P. aeruginosa were 1 and 64 mg/l for gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin and 0.5 and 64 mg/l for gatifloxacin. For staphylococci the two modes were 0.125 and 2 mg/l for gatifloxacin, 0.03 and 4 mg/l for gemifloxacin, and 0.03 and 2 mg/l for moxifloxacin; for enterococci, 0.25 and 16 mg/l for gatifloxacin, 0.06 and 2 mg/l for gemifloxacin, and 0.25 and 8 mg/l for moxifloxacin. Compared with trovafloxacin the MICs were similar, but the newer fluoroquinolones were more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. Of the newer fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin had the highest rate of renal excretion and could be considered a promising alternative fluoroquinolone agent for the treatment of UTI.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - Integron-located VEB-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate from Vietnam.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis Lil-1 was obtained from a Vietnamese patient hospitalized in Paris, France. This isolate was resistant to cephalosporins, and there was marked synergy between cephalosporins and clavulanic acid together with unusual synergy between cefoxitin and cefuroxime. PCR analysis revealed the presence of blaVEB-1, an integron-located gene coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) identified previously in an Escherichia coli isolate MG-1 from Vietnam. Using class 1 integron primers and blaVEB-1 intragenic primers, the insert region of the blaVEB-1-containing integron along with flanking sequences were amplified from P. mirabilis Lil-1 whole-cell DNA. A novel class 1 integron, In55, was identified that contained, in addition to intI1, qacEDelta1, sul1 and Orf5 genes, an 8 kb variable region. This region was comparable in size to that found previously in E. coli MG-1, but different from those previously identified in two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Thailand. In55 was located on a 190 kb self-transferable plasmid, which was different in size and structure from that found in E. coli MG-1. The finding of blaVEB-1 on different plasmids and integrons in enterobacterial isolates underlines the interspecies spread of this novel ESBL gene.
TI  - Proteus virulence: involvement of the pore forming alpha-hemolysin (a short review).
AB  - The genus Proteus belongs to the tribe of Proteae in the family of Enterobacteriaceae, and consists of five species: P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. morganii, P. penneri and P. myxofaciens. They are distinguished from the rest of Enterobacteriaceae by their ability to deaminate phenylalanine and tryptophane. They hydrolyze urea and gelatin and fail to ferment lactose, mannose, dulcitol and malonate; and do not form lysine and arginine decarboxylase or beta-galactosidase [1]. Colonies produce distinct "burned chocolate" odor and frequently show the characteristics of swarming motility on solid media. P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and P. morganii are widely recognized human pathogens. They have been isolated from urinary tract infections, wounds, ear, and nosocomial bacteremic infections, often in immuncompromised patients [2-6]. P. myxofaciens has no clinical interest to this time. P. penneri as species nova was nominated by the recommendation of Hickman and co-workers [7]. Formerly it was recognized as P. vulgaris biogroup 1 or indole negative P. vulgaris [8, 9]. Although it has been less commonly isolated from clinical samples than the other three human pathogenic Proteus species, it has nevertheless been connected with infections of the urinary tract, wounds and has been isolated from the feces of both healthy and diarrheic individuals [10-12]. Potential virulence factors responsible for virulence of Proteae are: IgA protease, urease, type3 fimbriae associated with MR/K haemagglutinins of at least two antigenic types, endotoxin, swarming motility and HlyA and/or HpmA type hemolysins [for review see ref. 13]. In the followings we give a survey of accumulated concepts about the position and characteristics of HlyA type alpha-hemolysins both in general and with emphasis on virulence functions in the tribe of Proteae.
TI  - Functions of the subunits in the FlhD(2)C(2) transcriptional master regulator of  bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming.
AB  - In enterobacteria like Salmonella, biogenesis of cell surface flagella needed for motility is dependent upon the master operon flhDC at the apex of the flagellar gene hierarchy. The operon products FlhD and FlhC act together in a FlhD(2)C(2 )heterotetramer to induce flagellar gene transcription, while FlhD also represses cell septation. The flhDC operon is pivotal to differentiation into elongated hyperflagellated swarm cells that undergo multicellular migration, most strikingly in Proteus. We set out to establish the mechanism of action of the FlhD(2)C(2) multimer. In Proteus swarm cell extracts, all the FlhC was assembled into the FlhD(2)C(2 )transcription activator, but FlhD additionally formed approximately equimolar amounts of a FlhD(2) homodimer. Both FlhD and FlhC subunits homodimerised in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that self-interactions stabilise the FlhD(2)C(2 )complex. The FlhC and FlhD subunit proteins were separately expressed and purified, and the FlhD(2)C(2)heterotetramer was reconstituted in vitro. Purified FlhC bound specifically and cooperatively to the promoter region of the flhDC-regulated flhB flagellar gene in the absence of FlhD. Purified FlhD was unable to bind this target DNA, but binding by the FlhD(2)C(2)complex was approximately tenfold greater than the FlhC subunit alone, suggesting that FlhD potentiated the FlhC/DNA interaction. In support of this possibility, pre-incubation of FlhC with FlhD reduced the apparent dissociation constant, K(D), for the FlhC/DNA complex from 100 nM to 13 nM. Furthermore, in competition assays, FlhD substantially increased the specificity of DNA recognition by FlhC, and also stabilised the resultant labile protein/DNA complex, prolonging its half-life from around two minutes to more than 40 minutes. FlhD(2)C(2)is therefore an atypical prokaryotic transcription activator in which interaction of the FlhC subunit with DNA target sequences is enhanced by the coexpressed helper subunit FlhD.
TI  - [Transfer of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and aztreonam in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases].
AB  - The authors demonstrated the transferability of antibiotic resistance genes in nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from newborn children at the Paediatric University Hospital in Bratislava. Strains were resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. The determinants of resistance (carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam) were transferred to recipient strains of Escherichia coli K-12 and Proteus mirabilis P-38. The transfer of resistance determinant from donor strains was demonstrated by the analysis of the resistance spectrum in transconjugant clones of recipient strains by the method of indirect selection. The ability of production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was demonstrated by the double disc diffusion test. Synergy between clavulanate and cefotaxime, clavulanate and ceftazidime and/or clavulanate and aztreonam indicated production of ESBL by these strains.
TI  - Evaluation of the role of two conserved active-site residues in beta class glutathione S-transferases.
AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) normally use hydroxy-group-containing residues  in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme for stabilizing the activated form of the co-substrate, glutathione. However, previous mutagenesis studies have shown that this is not true for Beta class GSTs and thus the origin of the stabilization remains a mystery. The recently determined crystal structure of Proteus mirabilis GST B1-1 (PmGST B1-1) suggested that the stabilizing role might be fulfilled in Beta class GSTs by one or more residues in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis we mutated His(106) and Lys(107) of PmGST B1-1 to investigate their possible role in the enzyme's catalytic activity. His(106) was mutated to Ala, Asn and Phe, and Lys(107) to Ala and Arg. The effects of the replacement on the activity, thermal stability and antibiotic-binding capacity of the enzyme were examined. The results are consistent with the involvement of His(106) and Lys(107) in interacting with glutathione at the active site but these residues do not contribute significantly to catalysis, folding or antibiotic binding.
TI  - DNA sequence analysis of the tellurite-resistance determinant from clinical strain of Escherichia coli and identification of essential genes.
AB  - The tellurite-resistant Escherichia coli strain KL53 was found during testing of  the group of clinical isolates for antibiotics and heavy metal ion resistance (Burian et al. 1990). Determinant of the tellurite resistance of the strain was located on the large conjugative plasmid pTE53 and cloned into pACYC184. Three different Ter clones harboring pLK2, pLK18 and pLK20 were isolated (Burian et al. 1998). The smallest functional Ter clone harboring pLK18 was chosen for further analysis. Plasmid pLK18 have been subcloned to obtain convenient DNA fragments for sequencing of tellurite-resistance determinant. Sequencing of this DNA fragments provided complete DNA sequence of the determinant, 5,250 bp in size. The sequence has been compared with nucleotide and protein databank (BLAST programs) and significant homology with the three known operons coding for tellurite resistance has been found (determinat on plasmid pR478 from Serratia marcescens, on plasmid pMER610 from Alcaligenes sp. and chromosomal tellurite resistance genes from Proteus mirabilis). We identified 5 ORFs coding for 5 genes named terB to terF. The clone harboring pLK18 was subjected to the transposition with Tn1737Km to disrupt determinant of the tellurite resistance. Plasmid DNA of several clones containing pLK18 with Tn1737Km was isolated to locate the target site of Tn1737Km. Analyses showed, the genes terB, terC, terD and terE are essential for conservation of the resistance whereas the gene terF is not important in this respect.
TI  - Genetic characterization of DNA region containing the trh and ure genes of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
AB  - We have demonstrated that possession of the gene for thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin (trh) coincides with the presence of the urease gene among clinical Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains and that the location of the two genes are in close proximity on the chromosome. Here, we cloned and sequenced the 15,754-bp DNA region containing the trh gene and the gene cluster for urease production from the chromosome of clinical V. parahaemolyticus (TH3996). We found 16 open reading frames (ORFs) and a lower G+C content (41%) compared with the total genome of this bacterium (46 to 47%). The ure cluster consisted of eight genes, namely, ureDABCEFG and ureR. ureR was located 5.2 kb upstream of the other seven genes in the opposite direction. The genetic organization and sequences of the ure genes resembled those found in Proteus mirabilis. Between ureR and the other ure genes, there were five ORFs, which are homologous with the nickel transport operon (nik) of Escherichia coli. We disrupted each of the ureR, ureC, and nikD genes in TH3996 by homologous recombination and analyzed the phenotype of the mutants. In the presence of urea these mutant strains had dramatically less urease activity than the strain they were derived from. Disruption of ureR, nikD, or ureC, however, had no effect on TRH production. The DNA region containing the trh, nik, and ure genes was found in only trh-positive strains and not in Kanagawa phenomenon-positive and environmental V. parahaemolyticus strains. At the end of the region, an insertion sequence-like element existed. These results suggest that the DNA region was introduced into V. parahaemolyticus in the past through a mechanism mediated by insertion sequences. This is the first reported case that the genes for an ATP-binding cassette-type nickel transport system, which may play a role in nickel transport through bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, are located adjacent to the ure cluster on the genome of an organism.
TI  - TEM-72, a new extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detected in Proteus mirabilis and  Morganella morganii in Italy.
AB  - A new natural TEM-2 derivative, named TEM-72, was identified in a Proteus mirabilis strain and in a Morganella morganii strain isolated in Italy in 1999. Compared to TEM-1, TEM-72 contains the following amino acid substitutions: Q39K, M182T, G238S, and E240K. Kinetic analysis showed that TEM-72 exhibits an extended-spectrum activity, including activity against oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam. Expression of bla(TEM-72) in Escherichia coli was capable of decreasing the host susceptibility to the above drugs.
TI  - Cefdinir versus cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study was conducted in Europe, South Africa, and Australia to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy and the tolerability of a cephalosporin antibiotic, cefdinir, with those of cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. METHODS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 5 days of treatment with either cefdinir 100 mg BID or cefaclor 250 mg TID. RESULTS: A total of 661 patients were randomized to treatment. They were 90% female, with a median age of 44 years. There were no clinically important differences between groups in terms of demographic characteristics or symptoms on admission. The most frequently isolated pathogens in admission urine cultures were Escherichia coli (383 patients), Proteus mirabilis (20 patients), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14 patients), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9 patients). Of the admission pathogens with documented susceptibility results, significantly more were resistant to cefaclor (6.7%) than to cefdinir (3.7%; P < 0.003). Significantly more admission isolates of E. coli were resistant to cefaclor (5.1%) than to cefdinir (2.0%; P < 0.007). A total of 383 patients were assessable for efficacy, 196 in the cefdinir group and 187 in the cefaclor group. Clinical cure rates and microbiologic response rates for cefdinir and cefaclor were statistically equivalent at 5 to 9 days posttherapy (test-of-cure visit), using a 95% CI approach. The rate of treatment-related adverse events was higher in cefdinir-treated patients (20.2%) than in cefaclor-treated patients (13.0%; P = 0.025), mainly due to the greater frequency of diarrhea in the former group. However, only 4 patients (1.2%) discontinued cefdinir treatment due to diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Empiric therapy with cefdinir appears to be a reasonable choice for patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection in whom cephalosporin treatment is indicated.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic otitis media in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the aetiology of chronic otitis media (COM) in Dar es Salaam and to find out the shelf life of boric acid in spirit ear drops (BAISED). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Muhimbili Medical Centre and selected primary schools within Dar es Salaam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacterial isolates and their sensitivity patterns and shelf life of BAISED. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy six pus swab specimens obtained from 150 patients with COM for more than three months were submitted for culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing in 1997. RESULTS: The isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (51.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (17.2%), Proteus mirabilis (13.2%), Klebsiella spp. (8.0%), Escherichia coli (5.8%) and unidentified coliforms in 4.0%. All isolates were sensitive to gentamicin. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to kanamycin was 98.5% and 100%, respectively. P. aeruginosa was sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and tetracycline by 58.1%, 10.1% and 8.3%, respectively. Three per cent BAISED inhibited the growth of all Pseudomonas aeruginosa even after it has been stored at room temperature for six weeks. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the drug of choice for management of COM in Dar es Salaam is gentamicin. However, given its ototoxicity effects and the fact that BAISED is effective and affordable, the later should be the treatment of choice.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug resistant organisms in an intensive care burn unit.
AB  - During January to December, 1998, analysis of an outbreak of infections in the burn intensive care unit (BICU) of the hospital attached to the Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana was carried out. A total of 868 clinical samples from 290 patients with more than 40 per cent thermal injury were investigated. These samples included 322 wound swabs, 325 blood and 221 urine samples. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 80, 62 and 48 per cent samples of pus, blood and urine respectively. Among the nine different pathogens isolated, the more common were Pseudomona aeruginosa from pus, Staphylococcus aureus from blood and Escherichia coli from urine samples. Multidrug resistance was observed among these predominant pathogens. Identical drug susceptibility pattern was depicted by large number of isolates of Ps. aeruginosa, Staph. aureus, Esch. coli and Proteus mirabilis. Similar pathogens with identical drug sensitivity pattern were isolated from environmental samples of the BICU. The ongoing outbreak of hospital acquired infection (HAI) was significantly reduced after strictly adhering to the guidelines for control of HAI.
TI  - Mechanisms of action of rabbit CAP18 on monolayers and liposomes made from endotoxins or phospholipids.
AB  - We have investigated the mechanism of action of the cationic antimicrobial protein (18 kDa) CAP18 on liposomes and monolayers made from phospholipids and enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). CAP18 intercalates into lipid matrices composed of LPS from sensitive strains, weaker into those made of LPS from a resistant strain (Proteus mirabilis strain R45) or negatively charged phospholipids, but not into those composed of neutral phosphatidylcholine. From the combination of data obtained with fluorescence resonance energy transfer and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and film balance measurements, it can be concluded that structural differences in the LPS determine the depth of intercalation of CAP18 into the respective lipid matrices. Thus, we identified the L-Arap4N linked to the first Kdo of the LPS of P. mirabilis strain R45 to be responsible for the CAP18 resistance of this strain. These data provide insight into CAP18-mediated effects on the integrity of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and led to an improved model for rabbit CAP18 membrane interaction.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - Characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in Taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  - During the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. The ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. The male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. The most common causative agent was group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 31.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (20%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. Among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. In contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after seven days of age). Ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. The most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. Since 1991, GBS has overtaken E. coli as the leading cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis. This was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - Lupene-type triterpenes from Periploca aphylla.
AB  - Two new lupane derivatives, 3beta,6alpha-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (1) and 6alpha-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3beta-octadecanoate (2), have been isolated from the stems of Periploca aphylla, in addition to beta-sitosterol and lupeol. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by spectral and chemical methods. Compound 1 showed strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase type VI and a moderate antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1998 to May 1999. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs, vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) had strong activities. Among E. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in 1997. VCM showed the highest activity against MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs of VCM for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active against MRSA with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. Particularly, meropenem (MEPM) showed the highest activity with the MICs of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. Almost all the drugs except minocycline (MINO) showed high activities against Proteus mirabilis. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. MEPM, IPM and gentamicin (GM) showed high activities against Serratia marcescens. Generally, it seemed that resistant strains of S. marcescens had decreased since 1996.
TI  - Cefditoren activity against nearly 1000 non-fastidious bacterial isolates and the development of in vitro susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Cefditoren (formerly ME-1206) is an investigational, orally administered cephalosporin ester with bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive and -negative organisms. Cefditoren potency against nearly 1000 non-fastidious species was determined by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. Against staphylococci, usable cefditoren activity was completely correlated with oxacillin with respect to potency and susceptibility interpretation (mec A-negative strains). Cefditoren was very active against Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli (MIC(90) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; median zone, 23-26 mm). Cefditoren had more limited activity against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and indole-positive Proteae (MIC(50) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; MIC(90), > 16 microg/ml; median zone, 18-25 mm). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and other non-fermentors, cefditoren was inactive (MIC(90), > 16 microg/ml; zone, 6 mm). Pharmacokinetic analysis of cefditoren showed that utilized dosages produce a plasma concentration that exceeds 0.5 microg/ml for 5 to 8 h and 1 microg/ml for 4 to 6 hours (T(1/2) ranges from 1.5-2 h). The following interpretive criteria were suggested: </= 2 microg/ml or >/= 15 mm (susceptible) and >/= 8 microg/ml or </= 11 mm (resistance) that yielded an intermethod categorical agreement of 95.8% and very major or major error rates of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Alternatively, </= 1 microg/ml or >/= 18 mm (susceptible) and >/= 4 microg/ml or </= 14 mm (resistant) breakpoints resulted in 96.2% accuracy and combined serious errors of only 1.1%. Cefditoren was observed to be a very active cephalosporin ranking among the most potent available orally active beta-lactams for use against a wide variety of pathogens.
TI  - Respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  - Although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. It has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. Plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (CCF) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (DOC) subjects (PII 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). While no subjects in the DOC group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the CCF subjects were found to be colonized. Oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in CCF subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and higher plaque scores. These results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of COPD may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in Brooklyn, NY: epidemiology and  relation to antibiotic usage patterns.
AB  - In November 1997, all Enterobacteriaceae isolated at 15 hospitals in Brooklyn were collected. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were present in 44% of 409 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Six isolates had reduced susceptibility to carbapenems, including two that were not susceptible to any of the antibiotics tested. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed a commonality of resistant isolates within and between hospitals. The occurrence of ESBLcontaining isolates was associated with cephalosporin usage (P = 0.055). ESBLs were present in 4.7% of Escherichia coli and 9.5% of Proteus mirabilis isolates. It is concluded that ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are endemic in Brooklyn, are spread between hospitals, and may be associated with cephalosporin usage.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml. Difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect. After 24 hours of incubation at pH 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except Staphylococcus intermedius. Against S. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (SB-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of Gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis) and Gram-positive wound infection resulting from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. Oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. Around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. In the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (P < 0.01) compared with no treatment. No comparator agent had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. Notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (P < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against E. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were inferior (P < 0.01) against P. mirabilis infection. In the S. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (P < 0.01). Results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (P > 0.05). Gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (P < 0.01). No comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against S. pyogenes or S. aureus infections. These data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of Gram-negative urinary tract infection and Gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the Careggi General Hospital in the period July-December 1996].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. METHODS: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 UFC/ml were examined in our Laboratory from July through December 1996. Inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. Five different ward typologies were taken into account (Surgery, Medicine, Obstetrics, Spinal Unit and High Risk Wards). Isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. Antibiotic susceptibility was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. For strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. RESULTS: The results obtained show that bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are Escherichia coli (45.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). Those most frequently isolated among outpatients are Escherichia coli (58.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). As far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned, whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). This implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Descriptive study of infectious ear disease in relation to summer].
AB  - A descriptive study was made of infectious ear disease (including diffuse otitis  externa, otomycosis, acute-on-chronic otitis media, and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity) in relation to changes of weather and habits in summer. During the months of June, July, and August 1996, 179 patients were evaluated in the emergency room of the Alicante General University Hospital, Spain. Average patient age at presentation was 30.52 (+/- 20.08) years and 56% were men. The most frequent disease was diffuse otitis externa (78%) followed by acute-on-chronic otitis media (12%), otomycosis (8%), and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity (2%). The most frequently involved microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diffuse otitis externa, Aspergillus niger and Candida in otomycosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus in acute-on-chronic otitis media. Patients were treated by cleaning detritus and secretions, usually followed by topical antibiotics for a maximum period of one week.
TI  - Occurrence and detection of AmpC beta-lactamases among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates at a veterans medical center.
AB  - AmpC beta-lactamases are cephalosporinases that confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs and that may thereby create serious therapeutic problems. Although reported with increasing frequency, the true rate of occurrence of AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis remains unknown. We tested a total of 1,286 consecutive, nonrepeat isolates of these three species and found that, overall, 45 (3.5%) yielded a cefoxitin zone diameter less than 18 mm (screen positive) and that 16 (1.2%) demonstrated AmpC bands by isoelectric focusing. Based on the species, of 683 E. coli, 371 K. pneumoniae, and 232 P. mirabilis isolates tested, 13 (1.9%), 28 (7.6%), and 4 (1.7%), respectively, demonstrated decreased zone diameters and 11 (1.6%), 4 (1.1%), and 1 (0.4%), respectively, demonstrated AmpC bands. Cefoxitin resistance was transferred for all but 8 (E. coli) of the 16 AmpC producers. We also describe a three-dimensional extract test, which was used to detect phenotypically isolates that harbor AmpC beta-lactamase. Of the 45 cefoxitin-resistant isolates, the three-dimensional extract test accurately identified all 16 AmpC producers and 28 of 29 (97%) isolates as non-AmpC producers. Interestingly, most (86%) isolates in the latter group were K. pneumoniae isolates. These data confirm that, at our institution, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis harbor plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes.
TI  - [Detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae in feces].
AB  - A study was made of 366 feces for detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  producing Enterobacteriaceae from feces. The selective agar was used for modified drigalski agar (Eiken Chemical Co., LTD) with 2 micrograms/ml cefotaxime (ESBL screen agar). 92 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 41 Escherichia coli, 15 Citrobacter freundii, 13 Enterobacter cloacae, 11 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other 12, were isolated from ESBL screen agar. And, R-plasmid that were selected by 2 micrograms/ml cefotaxime were transferred by conjugation from two of the 92 strains. These strain were E. coli TH9809927 and Proteus mirabilis TH9808262 that were amplified by "Toho-1 type" primer. The clude enzyme from two strains (donor) and transconjugants were especially hydrolysed cepharoridine and cefotaxime. Accordingly, two strains (0.5%) were detected as ESBL producers. We think that the result of our survey suggests the increase of ESBLs producing bacterial infection in Japan, and believe that there is a trend of infection of its by surveilance of the feces.
TI  - Frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious complications in severe pancreatitis are the main factors  determining clinical course and outcome. The taurocholate model for acute necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated for frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection. METHODS: Sixty-five male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 13 animals each. Specimens for bacteriologic examination were taken, and pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 3% taurocholate under sterile conditions. Animals were killed 8, 16, 24, or 32 hours thereafter, and bacteriologic examination was performed. A control group of animals with intraductal infusion of 0.9% saline solution were killed after 32 hours. RESULTS: There was no significant pancreatic infection in the control group and in the 8-hour group (1 of 13 rats). Sixteen and 24 hours after induction of pancreatitis, infection and inflammation of the pancreas were found in 77% (10 of 13 rats), and after 32 hours pancreatic infection occurred in 69% (9 of 13 rats). Extrapancreatic bacterial infection after 16 hours occurred in the liver (62%), spleen (62%), and mesenteric lymph nodes (46%). Bacteria infecting the pancreas reflected the bacterial spectrum of the large bowel and terminal ileum before induction of pancreatitis (Escherichia coli [77%], Proteus [43%], Enterococcus [37%], and Staphylococcus [23%]). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic infection is an early and frequent finding in the taurocholate model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Infection occurs between 8 and 16 hours after induction of pancreatitis. The source of infecting bacteria seems to be the large bowel or the terminal ileum. We present a useful model of severe pancreatitis in which to study bacterial translocation, the further route of spread, and therapeutic approaches.
TI  - H-NS is a repressor of the Proteus mirabilis urease transcriptional activator gene ureR.
AB  - Expression of Proteus mirabilis urease is governed by UreR, an AraC-like positive transcriptional activator. A poly(A) tract nucleotide sequence, consisting of A(6)TA(2)CA(2)TGGTA(5)GA(6)TGA(5), is located 16 bp upstream of the sigma(70)-like ureR promoter P2. Since poly(A) tracts of DNA serve as binding sites for the gene repressor histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS), we measured beta-galactosidase activity of wild-type Escherichia coli MC4100 (H-NS(+)) and its isogenic derivative ATM121 (hns::Tn10) (H-NS(-)) harboring a ureR-lacZ operon fusion plasmid (pLC9801). beta-Galactosidase activity in the H-NS(-) host strain was constitutive and sevenfold greater (P < 0.0001) than that in the H-NS(+) host. A recombinant plasmid containing cloned P. mirabilis hns was able to complement and restore repression of the ureR promoter in the H-NS(-) host when provided in trans. Deletion of the poly(A) tract nucleotide sequence from pLC9801 resulted in an increase in beta-galactosidase activity in the H-NS(+) host to nearly the same levels as that observed for wild-type pLC9801 harbored by the H-NS(-) host. Urease activity in strains harboring the recombinant plasmid pMID1010 (encoding the entire urease gene cluster of P. mirabilis) was equivalent in both the H-NS(-) background and the H-NS(+) background in the presence of urea but was eightfold greater (P = 0.0001) in the H-NS(-) background in the absence of urea. We conclude that H-NS represses ureR expression in the absence of urea induction.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections in France. Multicentre Study Group.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial strains isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI) in France. From December 1996 to March 1997, each of 15 private laboratories in France consecutively collected about 80 non-duplicate strains isolated from adult outpatients with UTI, including patients receiving care at home, and tested their susceptibility by the disk diffusion test. A total of 1160 strains were collected: 1031 gram-negative bacilli, including Escherichia coli (n = 865), Proteus mirabilis (n = 68) and Klebsiella spp. (n = 40), and 129 gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), other staphylococci (n = 25), group B streptococci (n = 25) and enterococci (n = 63). In the case of 430 bacterial isolates, the patients had either been hospitalised in the last 6 months or received antibiotic treatment in the last 3 months. The antibiotic susceptibility rates for Escherichia coli were: amoxicillin (58.7%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (63.3%), ticarcillin (61.4%), cephalothin (66.8%) cefuroxime (77.6%), cefixime (83.6%), cefotaxime (99.8%), ceftazidime (99%), nalidixic acid (91.9%), norfloxacin (96.6%), ofloxacin (96.3%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), cotrimoxazole (78.2%), fosfomycin (99.1%) and gentamicin (98.4%). Of the Enterobacteriaceae, five strains produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Methicillin resistance was detected in nine Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The most important findings were two extended-spectrum, beta-lactamase-producing and three methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients who had not been hospitalised in the last 6 months or taken antibiotics in the last 3 months. The findings indicate that these strains can spread within the community; therefore, monitoring antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the community appears to be mandatory.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative bacterial meningitis in term neonates with third generation cephalosporins plus amikacin.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy in terms of mortality and long-term morbidity of third generation cephalosporins and amikacin in combination for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial meningitis in a homogeneous group of neonates. A 15-year experience (1983-1997) with 72 term neonates without central nervous system anomalies and with gram-negative organisms grown in their cerebrospinal fluid treated with the above combination of antibiotics is presented. All isolated organisms were sensitive to cefotaxime or ceftazidime and to amikacin but 80% were resistant to ampicillin. The predominant infecting organism was Escherichia coli (68.0%) which was sensitive to both cefotaxime and amikacin in all cases but resistant to ampicillin in 48% of cases. Survival at discharge was 97.2% but ultimate survival was reduced to 94.4%, as 2 patients died a few months following discharge of conditions unrelated to meningitis. Ventriculitis was diagnosed in 10 neonates (13.8%). Among survivors, 1 neonate (1.3%) developed hydrocephalus needing shunting and 1 neonate (1.3%) with Proteus mirabilis developed a brain abscess with relapse of meningitis which was successfully treated with a 6-week course of chloramphenicol. At follow-up at an age greater than 6 months, 91.1% of the surviving infants were normal, while 92.3% of survivors at an age greater than 6 years were normal and attended normal school. These results, despite any reservations due to the nature of the study (retrospective, uncontrolled study), strongly support the use of third generation cephalosporins and amikacin in combination for the treatment of neonatal gram-negative bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparable endotoxic properties of lipopolysaccharides are manifest in diverse clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In general there is a poor correlation between serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS; the biologically active constituent of endotoxin) levels and mortality in septic patients. The objective of this study was to determine if chemical, structural, or biological differences among LPS from different clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria might explain this discrepancy. LPS preparations were made using the hot phenol-water extraction method from eight clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria. As a percentage of the total weight of the LPS, the phosphate content ranged from 3.0 to 13.8% (average, 6.7 +/- 3.6%), and the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate content ranged from 1.9 to 27.4% (average, 8.9 +/- 8.5%). These values were not dissimilar to those obtained for a reference endotoxin. In a standard measure of LPS activity, the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay, there was approximately a twofold difference between the least and most active preparations. The two preparations with the greatest difference in their ability to elicit the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from a mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line were similar in lethality when administered to mice sensitized to the effects of LPS by D(+)-galactosamine. These relatively minor differences in LPS activity seem unlikely to explain the generally observed discrepancy between serum endotoxin levels and mortality in patients with gram-negative sepsis.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis: a prospective, non-comparative multicentre clinical trial with long-term follow-up. The German Prostatitis Study Group.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd for 28 days were assessed in 65 adult males with symptomatic bacterial prostatitis, from eight centres in Germany. Urine and prostatic secretions were obtained for culture. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated at 12-18 days during treatment, end of treatment (4-9 days post-treatment), and 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-treatment. Safety was monitored during and at the end of treatment. E. coli was the most frequent pathogen causing infection (35/62) and Enterococcus faecalis the second most frequent (13/62). The combined bacteriological response by patient determined at return visits 4-9 days post and 1 month post-treatment, respectively, was eradication 48/54 (88.9%), persistence 3/54 (5.6%), eradication with recurrence 1/54 (1.9%) and eradication with reinfection 2/54 (3.7%). The clinical response at 1 month post-treatment was resolution 53/54 (98. 1%) and 1/54 (1.9%) failure. The rates for continued eradication in the extended follow-up were 32/39 (82.1%) after 3 months, 26/34 (76. 4%) after 6 months and 13/22 (59.1%) after 9 months. Nineteen patients experienced at least one adverse event. In two patients the trial was prematurely discontinued due to adverse events.
TI  - CTX-M-type beta-lactamases: an emerging group of extended-spectrum enzymes.
AB  - CTX-M-type beta-lactamases constitute a novel group of class A beta-lactamases with extended-spectrum properties. They are encoded by transferable plasmids and found in various enterobacteria, mostly Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. CTX-M enzymes share extensive sequence similarity with the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca. They efficiently hydrolyze many newer broad-spectrum oximino-beta-lactams including cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam and are readily inhibited by tazobactam and clavulanate. CTX-M-producing enterobacteria are endemic in Latin America and in some areas of North Eastern Europe. Data on their structure, properties and epidemiology are discussed.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Investigation of plants used in Jamaican folk medicine for anti-bacterial activity.
AB  - We have started a systematic scientific study of folklore medicinal plants currently used as alternative medicine in Jamaican society. In this initial study, extracts of plants widely used by the islanders are studied for antibacterial activity against five common pathogens; Streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. These studies revealed that 25% (approx.) of the plant extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes used. Subsequent to these observations, extracts from Mikania micrantha were examined in detail. This led to the isolation of two sesquiterpenoids, mikanolide and dihydromikanolide, with activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. The results suggest that traditional folk medicine could be used as a guide in our continuing search for new natural products with potential medicinal properties.
TI  - Microbiologic survey of long-term care facilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We undertook a microbiologic survey of long-term care facilities to categorize bacteria found in cultures of residents. Culture and sensitivity data were collected on 566 samples from indwelling bladder catheters, percutaneous gastrostomy tubes, nares, stool, wounds, pressure ulcers, and tracheostomies in 25 Nebraska and Iowa facilities. Information was also collected on resident factors (eg, presence of indwelling urinary catheter, prior antibiotic administration) and institutional variables (eg, number of beds, nosocomial infection rates). RESULTS: There were 478 gram-negative isolates, the leading organisms being Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There were 221 gram-positive isolates, the most frequently seen of which were enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the 442 residents sampled in the study, 168 (38%) were taking, or had within the previous month been taking, a systemic antibiotic. Quinolones were the most frequently prescribed antibiotic class. The institutional prevalence of urinary catheterization averaged 6.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Significant antibiotic pressure exists in long-term care facilities, a fact that is reflected in antibiotic resistance patterns. A variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were found in nursing home culture specimens.
TI  - Biochemical sequence analyses of GES-1, a novel class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron In52 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae ORI-1 was isolated in 1998 in France from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in Cayenne Hospital, Cayenne, French Guiana. This strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, pTK1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. The gene for GES-1 (Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B, where this pI-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kDa molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to ceftazidime). GES-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase GN79 from Proteus mirabilis; with YENT, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from Yersinia enterocolitica; and with L-2, a chromosome-borne class A cephalosporinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). However, a dendrogram analysis showed that GES-1 clustered within a class A ESBL subgroup together with ESBLs VEB-1 and PER-1. Sequencing of a 7,098-bp DNA fragment from plasmid pTK1 revealed that the GES-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named In52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an intI1 gene possessing two putative promoters, P(1) and P(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an attI1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(GES-1), aac(6')Ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrXVb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA4), and aadA2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacEDelta1 and sulI. The bla(GES-1) and aadA2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. This work identified the second class A ESBL gene of a non-TEM, non-SHV series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.
TI  - Biological activities of lipopolysaccharides of Proteus spp. and their interactions with polymyxin B and an 18-kDa cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP18)-derived peptide.
AB  - The saccharide constituents of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Proteus spp. vary with the strain and contain unique components about which little is known. The biological activities of LPS and lipid A from S- and R-forms of 10 Proteus strains were examined. LPS from all S-form Proteus strains was lethal to D-(+)-galactosamine (GalN)-loaded, LPS-responsive, C3H/HeN mice, but not to LPS-hypo-responsive C3H/HeJ mice. P. vulgaris 025 LPS evoked strong anaphylactoid reactions in N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP)-primed C3H/HeJ mice. LPS from S- and R-form Proteus strains induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by macrophages isolated from C3H/HeN but not C3H/HeJ mice. Lipid A from Proteus strains also induced NO and TNF production, although lipid A was less potent than LPS. The effects of LPS were mainly dependent on CD14; LPS-induced NO and TNF production in CD14+ J774.1 cells was significantly greater than in CD14-J7.DEF.3 cells. All LPS from Proteus strains, and especially from P. vulgaris 025, exhibited higher anti-complementary activity than LPS from Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymyxin B inactivated proteus LPS in a dose-dependent manner, but these LPS preparations were more resistant to polymyxin B than E. coli LPS. CAP18(109-135), a granulocyte-derived peptide, inhibited proteus LPS endotoxicity only when the LPS:CAP18(109-135) ratio was appropriate, which suggests that CAP18(109-135) acts through a different mechanism than polymyxin B. The results indicate that LPS from Proteus spp. are potently endotoxic, but that the toxicity is different from that of LPS from E. coli or Salmonella spp. and even varies among different Proteus strains. The variation in biological activities among proteus LPS may be due to unique components within the respective LPS.
TI  - PCR studies on the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis in the upper urinary tract of patients with obstructive pyelonephritis.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis infections are among the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world and it is only logical to hypothesize that it alone or in association with mycoplasmas can participate in the initiation and persistence of upper urinary tract infections. Having in mind the inconclusive evidence regarding the role of C. trachomatis in upper urinary tract infections we decided to study the presence of C. trachomatis in the upper urinary tract of patients with obstructive pyelonephritis using the polymerase chain reaction. We studied 20 patients (12 female and 8 male, aged 20-60 years) with symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis in accordance with Kunin's criteria (1997). Samples were taken during surgery of the upper urinary tract by aspirating urine from the renal pelvis or the ureter above the level of the obstruction and analyzed for the presence of bacterial pathogens using routine microbiological techniques and employing the "AMPLICOR CT/NG" test (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA) for the presence of C. trachomatis. Chlamydia trachomatis was found in the aspirated urine of 5 patients (25%). In 3 of the patients the microbiological tests of the aspirated urine did not establish any other microbial agent. In the other two Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were cultured. The analysis of the clinical and laboratory findings in the patients with Chlamydia trachomatis infection alone and those with an associated bacterial pathogen failed to reach statistical significance. Following the operation all of the patients received treatment with Ofloxacin 200 mg bid for 7 days with a favorable clinical and laboratory outcome. In our opinion, the AMPLICOR CT/NG test is a sensitive and specific method for diagnosing low-number Chlamydia trachomatis infections of the upper urinary tract in patients with obstructive pyelonephritis. Chlamydia trachomatis should be considered as a possible etiologic agent in acute pyelonephritis and the therapeutic regimen in such patients should be targeted at its possible underlying presence.
TI  - Rapid turnover of FlhD and FlhC, the flagellar regulon transcriptional activator  proteins, during Proteus swarming.
AB  - The enterobacterial flhDC master operon activates expression of the flagellar biogenesis gene hierarchy and also represses cell division. During Proteus mirabilis differentiation into elongated hyperflagellated swarm cells, flhDC transcription is strongly but transiently increased. We show that concentration of the FlhD and FlhC proteins is also tightly controlled at the posttranslational level. This is achieved by protein degradation, which is most severe after differentiation when the half-life of both proteins is ca. 2 min. Degradation is energy dependent and putatively involves the Lon protease.
TI  - Intestinal protozoa in HIV-infected patients: effect of rifaximin in Cryptosporidium parvum and Blastocystis hominis infections.
AB  - In HIV-1 infected patients severe enteritis and chronic diarrhea are often documented as a consequence of multiple opportunistic infections. We analyzed 48 HIV-1 positive patients for the presence of intestinal pathogenic protozoa. Patients with CD4 > or = 200/mm3 showed a higher prevalence of a single pathogenic protozoa than patients with CD4 < or =200/mm3, who showed the presence of multiple protozoal infections. Patients who proved positive for only a single protozoa, Cryptosporidium or Blastocystis, were also positive, by stool culture, for the presence of Proteus mirabilis (3 samples), Citrobacter freundii (3 samples), Escherichia coli (one sample) or Enterobacter cloacae (one sample). Treatment with rifaximin (600 mg, 3 times a day, for 14 days) was efficacious in resolving the clinical symptoms and clearing protozoan infections in HIV-1 infected patients with CD4 > or = 200/mm3, who presented enteric and systemic symptoms due to Criptosporidium or Blastocystis associated with enteropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Interactions of "Limax amoebae" and gram-negative bacteria: experimental studies  and review of current problems.
AB  - Free-living amoebae can harbour bacteria inside their cysts giving them a microhabitat and protecting them from disinfectants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential importance of "Limax amoebae" as vectors for environmental and nosocomial bacteria in a hospital. It was shown that free-living amoebae are ubiquitous in the investigated hospital, occur syntopically with facultative human pathogens (Comamonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and may serve as hosts not only for these but also for bacteria isolated from clinical specimens (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); temperature is apparently of crucial importance for the interactions between these microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that "Limax amoebae" apart from acting as protective hosts, may also play a role for the thermotolerance, invasiveness and antibiotic-resistance of bacteria. Considering also the reduced immune-status of many patients, this "symbiosis" of free-living amoebae and bacteria might still be of underestimated hospital-hygienic importance.
TI  - Introduction of a mini-gene encoding a five-amino acid peptide confers erythromycin resistance on Bacillus subtilis and provides temporary erythromycin protection in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A 15-bp mini-gene was introduced into Bacillus subtilis and into stable protoplast-like L-forms of Proteus mirabilis. This mini-gene encoded the peptide MVLFV and modeled a fragment of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA responsible for E. coli erythromycin (Ery) resistance. Expression of the introduced mini-gene conferred permanent Ery resistance on B. subtilis. In L-forms of P. mirabilis, the Ery-protective effect was maintained in the course of several generations. Herewith, the mechanism of Ery resistance mediated by expression of specific short peptides was shown to exist in evolutionary distant bacteria. Three new plasmids were constructed containing the gene under study transcriptionally fused with the genes encoding glutamylendopeptidase of Bacillus licheniformis or delta-endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis. The Ery resistance pentapeptide (E-peptide) mini-gene served as an efficient direct transcriptional reporter and allowed to select bacillar glutamylendopeptidase with improved productivity. The mini-genes encoding E-peptides may be applied as selective markers to transform both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The small size of the E-peptide mini-genes makes them attractive selective markers for vector construction.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of belizean plants: an improved method.
AB  - The influences of medium type, inoculum density, and a cold incubation on antimicrobial assay sensitivity were tested. The largest and most distinct zones were produced using nutrient agar and the 1/10 4 inoculum density for Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis but a 1/10 12 inoculum density for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli . The greatest number of zones were detected without cold incubation. Using this method, eight plants from Belize were screened for antibacterial activity. Six plants showed activity against the four organisms tested. Both inoculum density and medium type played important roles in assay sensitivity; however, inoculum density was of more practical significance.
TI  - Antimicrobial Effects of Propolis Extracts on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Strains Resistant to Various Antibiotics and Some Microorganisms.
AB  - ABSTRACT Propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. The bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant in the hive. Propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties. In this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three Escherichia coli and two Staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on Salmonella typhimurium, Bruceila abortus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, Candida tropicalis, and Aspergillus niger were studied. Propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). At concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the microorganisms in acetone and DMSO in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. The results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.
TI  - Production of a TEM-24 plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Several Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, including one urinary isolate producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24, were isolated from a long-term-hospitalized woman. Three TEM-24-producing enterobacterial species (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were isolated from the same patient. TEM-24 and the resistance markers for aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamide were encoded by a 180-kb plasmid transferred by conjugation into E. coli HB101.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) in adult postneurosurgical patients. METHODS: Thirty adult patients with GNBM were included in this study. Their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. The patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. Seven had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. Two patients were associated with brain abscess. RESULTS: The pathogens found in the 30 GNBM patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. Among these 30 patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant GNBM were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. Appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. Eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. All eight died. The mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase of GNBM in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. In addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic challenge. We noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. Therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients with nosocomially acquired GNBM, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. Early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.
TI  - Molecular recognition of synthetic siderophore analogues: a study with receptor-deficient and fhu(A-B) deletion mutants of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The biological activity of six synthetic siderophore analogues (two dihydroxamates, two trihydroxamates, one tetrahydroxamate and one 3-hydroxy-4(1H)pyridinone) has been studied in Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii 13 and Proteus mirabilis 8993 strains by using growth promotion tests. Various transport-deficient mutants of E. coli were used to study the route of entry into gram-negative bacteria. The results indicated that the synthetic hydroxamate compounds are transported via Fhu-mediated transport systems, although receptor specificity was low. This could be proven by using a delta (fhuA-B) E. coli mutant as a control in which growth promotion by natural hydroxamates was completely abolished, suggesting that a periplasmic binding-protein-dependent transport system (FhuB, C, D) is required for the transport of all synthetic ferric hydroxamate complexes. Although utilization of the synthetic hydroxamates was generally lower than that of the natural siderophores, differences in growth promotion could be detected. Highest activity was observed with the dihydroxamate DOCYDHAMA ligand which supported growth at concentrations < 1 mM. In comparison with other polyamino-polyhydroxamate ligands studied, this dihydroxamate ligand has an extra diamide backbone that could be important for the interaction with the receptors or with FhuD. The synthetic trihydroxamate and tetrahydroxamate ligands showed a relatively low siderophore activity. Studies with Proteus and Morganella in the presence of increasing bipyridyl concentrations showed a decreased growth promotion with the synthetic ferric hydroxamates, suggesting the involvement of a reduction step during iron mobilization or an increased toxicity of bipyridyl. This was not observed in the case of the 3-hydroxy-4(1H)pyridinone where bipyridyl had no effect.
TI  - Clostridium difficile toxins may augment bacterial penetration of intestinal epithelium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile can be recovered from many high-risk hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Clostridium difficile toxins A and B have been associated with increased intestinal permeability in vitro and there is growing evidence that increased intestinal permeability may be a common mechanism whereby enteric bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium. HYPOTHESIS: Clostridium difficile-induced alterations in the intestinal barrier facilitate microbial penetration of the intestinal epithelium, which in turn facilitates the translocation of intestinal bacteria. DESIGN: Mature Caco-2 enterocytes were pretreated with varying concentrations of toxin A or toxin B followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of either Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, or Proteus mirabilis. The effects of toxins A and B on enterocyte viability, cytoskeletal actin, and ultrastructural topography were assessed using vital dyes, fluorescein-labeled phalloidin, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The toxins' effects on bacterial adherence and bacterial internalization by cultured enterocytes were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative culture, respectively. Epithelial permeability was assessed by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and by quantifying paracellular bacterial movement through Caco-2 enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. RESULTS: Neither toxin A nor toxin B had a measurable effect on the numbers of enteric bacteria internalized by Caco-2 enterocytes; however, both toxins were associated with alterations in enterocyte actin, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and increased bacterial adherence and paracellular transmigration. CONCLUSION: Clostridium difficile toxins A or B may facilitate bacterial adherence and penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier.
TI  - Characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in North America: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 1997.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program evaluates international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. We describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from UTIs during the third-quarter of 1997 in North America (United States and Canada), as part of this worldwide program. The isolates were tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and automated ribotyping. The five most frequently isolated species were Escherichia coli (48.6%), Enterococcus spp. (13.7%), Klebsiella spp. (12.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and Enterobacter spp. or Proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). For each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. For Gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against E. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). Approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the USA were vancomycin-resistant (88% with Van A). P. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). E. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), K. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single Enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other Enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (Amp C) Stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). These data demonstrated that several UTI isolates in SENTRY hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.
TI  - Molecular mechanisms of interaction of rabbit CAP18 with outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mechanism of interaction of the cationic antimicrobial protein (18 kDa), CAP18, with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria was investigated applying transmission electron microscopy and voltage-clamp techniques on artificial planar bilayer membranes. Electron micrographs of bacterial cells exposed to CAP18 showed damage to the outer membrane of the sensitive Escherichia coli strains F515 and ATCC 11775, whereas the membrane of the resistant Proteus mirabilis strain R45 remained intact. Electrical measurements on various planar asymmetric bilayer membranes, one side consisting of a phospholipid mixture and the other of different phospholipids or of lipopolysaccharide (reconstitution model of the outer membrane), yielded information about the influence of CAP18 on membrane integrity. Addition of CAP18 to the side with the varying lipid composition led to lipid-specific adsorption of CAP18 and subsequent induction of current fluctuations due to the formation of transient membrane lesions at a lipid-specific clamp voltage. We propose that the applied clamp voltage leads to reorientation of CAP18 molecules adsorbed to the bilayer into an active transmembrane configuration, allowing the formation of lesions by multimeric clustering.
TI  - The use of CHROMagar Orientation as a primary isolation medium with presumptive identification for the routine screening of urine specimens.
AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the use of a novel differential culture medium CHROMagar, for both primary isolation and presumptive identificaton, with the method currently used in our laboratory for screening mid-stream-urine samples (MSU). Routine methods (RM) included blotting paper imprinting of all specimens and additional quantitative culture on cysteine lactose electrolyte-deficient agar (CLED) for selected samples together with Microbact 12E for further identification. The CHROMagar method (CH) relied on the use of blotting paper imprints, colonial colour and morphology on CHROMagar only. With respect to the 3390 MSU specimens examined, both methods yielded similar results in 3240, including > or = 87% of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis/Morganella morganii and Enterobacter/Serratia/Klebsiella/Citrobacter spp. Of the 52 discordant identifications, yeasts were reported as staphylococci on CHROMagar in 10. The overall cost of materials per specimen was US$ 0.30 by RM and $ 0.24 by CH. It took about 3 min to perform each Microbact test. Thus, CHROMagar plus Gram stain and other simple bench tests gave results similar to those using our current method, but had the advantage of saving time and materials.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Quorum-sensing cross talk: isolation and chemical characterization of cyclic dipeptides from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In cell-free Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture supernatants, we identified two compounds capable of activating an N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) biosensor. Mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy revealed that these compounds were not AHLs but the diketopiperazines (DKPs), cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val) and cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) respectively. These compounds were also found in cell-free supernatants from Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter agglomerans [cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val) only]. Although both DKPs were absent from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas alcaligenes, we isolated, from both pseudomonads, a third DKP, which was chemically characterized as cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro). Dose-response curves using a LuxR-based AHL biosensor indicated that cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val), cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) and cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) activate the biosensor in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit at much higher concentrations than the natural activator N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL). Competition studies showed that cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val), cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) and cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) antagonize the 3-oxo-C6-HSL-mediated induction of bioluminescence, suggesting that these DKPs may compete for the same LuxR-binding site. Similarly, DKPs were found to be capable of activating or antagonizing other LuxR-based quorum-sensing systems, such as the N-butanoylhomoserine lactone-dependent swarming motility of Serratia liquefaciens. Although the physiological role of these DKPs has yet to be established, their activity suggests the existence of cross talk among bacterial signalling systems.
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - Paediatric nosocomial urinary tract infection at a regional hospital.
AB  - From a total of 26,603 admissions to the paediatric wards, 1360 paediatric nosocomial urinary tract infections (PNUTI) were identified during a 5-year retrospective chart review at the SFGH. The ages ranged from 3 days to 13 years, with 46% boys and 54% girls. The highest rates of PNUTI per service per 100 admissions were seen in the nursery (11.28) followed by paediatric surgery (2.89) and paediatric medicine (2.86). Although the greatest number of PNUTI occurred in the nursery, comparison between the years was not statistically significant. About 90% (1218 of 1360) of PNUTI occurred in catheterized patients. No documentation was found specifying the type of catheterization (intermittent or continuous). About 90% (1210 of 1360) of isolates were single organisms with Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Group B streptococci accounting for a total of approximately 70% of all pathogens. However, the composition of the most common isolate in each service differed. The most common isolate in the nursery was E. coli, in the paediatric medical and surgical services the most common isolates were Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis, respectively. Proteus mirabilis was isolated predominantly from boys with structural abnormality of the urethral tract. No PNUTIs were complicated by bacteraemia. The antibiotics with least effectiveness (in increasing order) for UTIs were cephalexin, ampicillin, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole and tetracycline. The most effective antibiotics were nalidixic acid, gentamicin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Ocimum gratissimum L. essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) of Ocimum gratissimum inhibited Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Shigella flexineri, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Proteus mirabilis were at concentrations ranging from 3 to 12 microg/ml. The endpoint was not reached for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (>=24 mg/ml). The MICs of the reference drugs used in this study were similar to those presented in other reports. The minimum bactericidal concentration of EO was within a twofold dilution of the MIC for this organism. The compound that showed antibacterial activity in the EO of O. gratissimum was identified as eugenol and structural findings were further supported by gas chromatography/mass spectra retention time data. The structure was supported by spectroscopic methods.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potency of tannins and related compounds using the microdilution broth method.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a total of 27 tannins and related compounds was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 2 Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), 4 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis), and 2 yeasts (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). The compounds tested were generally found to possess only weak to moderate antibacterial, but fairly high anticryptococcal activities. Attention is given to structure-activity relationships with emphasis on simple galloyl esters, hydrolyzable tannins and proanthcyanidins among this class of secondary products.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of lactoferricin B.
AB  - The antimicrobial peptide, lactoferricin, can be generated upon gastric pepsin cleavage of lactoferrin. We have examined the inhibitory efficacy of lactoferricin of bovine origin (Lf-cin B) on Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus with or without a cell wall. We found that spheroplasts and protoplasts had a lower MIC than their counterparts with a cell wall. We also compared the efficacies of Lf-cin B (17-31) made of all L-amino acids and all D-amino acids. The peptide made of all D-amino acids was more active than the corresponding L-enantiomer. Furthermore, we examined the influence of Lf-cin B on the motility of E. coli and the influence of temperature on the susceptibility of bacteria exposed to Lf-cin B. Bacteria exposed to sub-MIC of Lf-cin B lost their motility. Bacteria exposed to Lf-cin B at 20 degrees C were more sensitive to Lf-cin B than when exposed at 37 degrees C. These findings indicate that the cell envelope is a limiting step for Lf-cin B to exert its antibiotic effect. We cannot rule out a receptor-mediated first step for Lf-cin B (17-31).
TI  - Flavone and xanthone derivatives related to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A number of flavone and xanthone derivatives bearing some characteristic features of fluoroquinolones such as the fluorine atom and an ortho piperazine ring are described. The new compounds have been tested for possible cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. Cytotoxicity of both groups of compounds is rather poor, while the antibacterial activity is restricted to xanthones.
TI  - Demographic, clinical, and treatment parameters influencing the outcome of acute  cystitis.
AB  - A meta-analysis of six double-blinded clinical trials was undertaken to identify  risk factors associated with bacteriologic outcome in 3,108 women with acute cystitis. Eleven antibiotic regimens were used, including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. Entry criteria for all studies were identical. Among 2,409 patients who were defined to be valid for efficacy analysis, pathogens included Escherichia coli (78.6%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), and "other" (9%). Causative bacteria were eradicated at the end of treatment in 93% of patients. The following parameters were associated with successful bacteriologic outcome: not using a diaphragm (P = .0041), treatment for > or = 3 days (P = .0043), pathogen not "other" (P = .0043), symptom duration of < 2 days (P = .0096), and African American race (P = .0147). K. pneumoniae (P = .0496) and "other" pathogens (P = .0018) were associated with increased probability of bacteriologic treatment failure. The presence of pyuria (> or = 10 WBCs per high-power field) did not correlate with outcome and was inversely correlated with the finding of > or = 10(5) bacterial colony-forming units per mL of urine (P < .001). This large database identifies new parameters associated with treatment outcomes of acute cystitis and calls into question current clinical trial guidelines.
TI  - Cyanobacteria--a potential source of new biologically active substances.
AB  - Hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts of twelve cyanobacterial strains, isolated from fresh and brackish water, and two waterblooms, collected during the summer from the Baltic Sea, were investigated for their antibiotic activities against seven microorganisms. No inhibitory effects were found against the three Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens and the yeast Candida maltosa. Of all cyanobacterial samples, extracts from seven species inhibited the growth of at least one of the Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus flavus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. M. flavus proved to be the most sensitive bacterium in the agar diffusion test system. In particular, the hexane and dichlormethane extracts showed antimicrobial effects. But only one water extract, prepared from material of a natural waterbloom, was found to be active.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of Australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  - To compare the antibacterial activity of the Australian tea tree oil (TTO) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by GC-MS and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The highest activity was obtained by TTO, with MIC values of 0.25% for Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and S. xylosus. It is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than TTO against gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.12%. Both TTO and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.
TI  - Aspects of the antimicrobial efficacy of grapefruit seed extract and its relation to preservative substances contained.
AB  - The antimicrobial efficacy as well as the content of preservative agents of six commercially available grapefruit seed extracts were examined. Five of the six extracts showed a high growth inhibiting activity against the test germs Bacillus subtilis SBUG 14, Micrococcus flavus SBUG 16, Staphylococcus aureus SBUG 11, Serratia marcescens SBUG 9, Escherichia coli SBUG 17, Proteus mirabilis SBUG 47, and Candida maltosa SBUG 700. In all of the antimicrobial active grapefruit seed extracts, the preservative benzethonium chloride was detected by thin layer chromatography. Additionally, three extracts contained the preserving substances triclosan and methyl parabene. In only one of the grapefruit seed extracts tested no preservative agent was found. However, with this extract as well as with several self-made extracts from seed and juiceless pulp of grapefruits (Citrus paradisi) no antimicrobial activity could be detected (standard serial broth dilution assay, agar diffusion test). Thus, it is concluded that the potent as well as nearly universal antimicrobial activity being attributed to grapefruit seed extract is merely due to the synthetic preservative agents contained within. Natural products with antimicrobial activity do not appear to be present.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - In vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant Spanish clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. Isolates were selected when their MIC to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). The following strains were tested: 61 Escherichia coli, 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Proteus mirabilis, 21 Serratia marcescens, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 Staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. Of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. The percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for E. coli, 75% for K. pneumoniae, 71.4% for P. mirabilis, 28.6% for S. marcescens, 75% for E. cloacae, 33.3% for P. aeruginosa, 90.5% for S. aureus and 40% for Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. It was particularly active against S. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.
TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: 11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with AS, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. The peripheral T cell receptor Vbeta repertoire was investigated using FACS analysis and 14 different Vbeta antibodies. In addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma ELISPOT assays. RESULTS: Twins suffering from AS showed cellular hyporeactivity against K pneumoniae, S pyogenes, C albicans in the ELISPOT assays compared with healthy twins. In contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, AS concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their Vbeta repertoire on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective T cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. There are probably other environmental factors that influence disease concordance.
TI  - A Zn(II)-translocating P-type ATPase from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A mutant of Proteus mirabilis had been previously isolated as defective in swarming. The mutation had been found to be in a gene related to the Escherichia coli zntA gene, which encodes the ZntA Zn(II)-translocating P-type ATPase. In this study the P. mirabilis gene was expressed in an E. coli strain in which the zntA gene had been disrupted. The P. mirabilis gene complemented the sensitivity to salts of zinc and cadmium. Everted membrane vesicles from the zntA-disrupted strain lost ATP-driven 65Zn(II) uptake. Membranes from the complemented strain had restored 65Zn(II) transport. These results demonstrate that the P. mirabilis homologue of ZntA is a Zn(II)-translocating P-type ATPase.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Effect of local application of the antimicrobial peptide IB-367 on the incidence  and severity of oral mucositis in hamsters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this animal study was to determine whether IB-367, an antimicrobial peptide, is able to ameliorate oral mucositis by reducing microflora densities on the mucosal surfaces of the mouth. STUDY DESIGN: Oral mucositis was induced in hamsters by intraperitoneal injection of 5-fluorouracil followed by superficial abrasion of the buccal mucosa. A test formulation was applied topically to the buccal mucosa 5 or 6 times per day starting 6 to 8 hours before abrasion. RESULTS: Mucositis scores were significantly lower (P < .05) in hamsters given formulations containing 0.5 or 2.0 mg/mL of IB-367 than in placebo-treated controls. Treatment with IB-367 produced a more than 100-fold reduction in oral microflora densities. In a second experiment, treatment of hamsters with a formulation containing IB-367 at 0.12, 0.5 or 2.0 mg/mL resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in mucositis severity. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that reduction of local microflora densities through use of IB-367 may improve clinical outcomes in patients at risk for the development of oral mucositis.
TI  - Evidence that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have asymptomatic 'non-significant' Proteus mirabilis bacteriuria more frequently than healthy controls.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are reported to have in their sera raised levels of antibody specific to Proteus mirabilis. The aim of the study was to verify this and to determine an explanation for it by investigating the frequency of P. mirabilis urinary tract infection in RA patients and matched controls. METHODS: freshly voided urine was examined for the presence, number and identity of infecting bacteria. The levels of antibody in blood and in urine of the IgM, IgA and IgG classes to the common O serotypes of P. mirabilis and the antigens to which they reacted were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. RESULTS: analysis of urine from 76 patients with RA and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls showed that only two (4%) of the control urines but 25 (33%) of those from the RA patients were infected. The commonest infecting organism in the RA patients' urine was Proteus mirabilis which occurred twice as frequently as Escherichia coli. Proteus mirabilis was found in 52% of the infected urines of the RA patients and was always detected as a pure growth and usually in insignificant (< 10(4)/ml) numbers. It is highly improbable that this finding was the outcome of differences in age, physical ability or medication between the RA and control patient groups. Comparison of antibody levels to P. mirabilis by ELISA showed RA patients had raised (P < 0.0001, P = 0.001, P = 0.0063) levels of IgA, IgG and IgM respectively in their sera and raised (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0001) levels of IgG, IgM and IgA respectively in their urine compared with the control group. It was not possible to detect an antibody reacting to a P. mirabilis antigen that was specific to the RA patients. CONCLUSION: the results confirm that RA patients have raised levels of antibody to P. mirabilis not only in blood but also in urine and suggest that this arises because RA patients have an asymptomatic, non-significant P. mirabilis bacteriuria more frequently or more prolonged than control patients. This may be the trigger for their RA condition.
TI  - Metabolism of L(-)-carnitine by Enterobacteriaceae under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Different Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, are able to convert L(-)-carnitine, via crotonobetaine, into gamma-butyrobetaine in the presence of carbon and nitrogen sources under aerobic conditions. Intermediates of L(-)-carnitine metabolism (crotonobetaine, gamma-butyrobetaine) could be detected by thin-layer chromatography. In parallel, L(-)-carnitine dehydratase, carnitine racemasing system and crotonobetaine reductase activities were determined enzymatically. Monoclonal antibodies against purified CaiB and CaiA from E. coli O44K74 were used to screen cell-free extracts of different Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli ATCC 25922, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae) grown under aerobic conditions in the presence of L(-)-carnitine.
TI  - Requirement of MrpH for mannose-resistant Proteus-like fimbria-mediated hemagglutination by Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Two new genes, mrpH and mrpJ, were identified downstream of mrpG in the mrp gene  cluster encoding mannose-resistant Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis. Since the predicted MrpH has 30% amino acid sequence identity to PapG, the Galalpha(1-4)Gal-binding adhesin of Escherichia coli P fimbriae, we hypothesized that mrpH encodes the functional MR/P hemagglutinin. MR/P fimbriae, expressed in E. coli DH5alpha, conferred on bacteria both the ability to cause mannose-resistant hemagglutination and the ability to aggregate to form pellicles on the broth surface. Both a DeltamrpH mutant expressed in E. coli DH5alpha and an isogenic mrpH::aphA mutant of P. mirabilis were unable to produce normal MR/P fimbriae efficiently, suggesting that MrpH was involved in fimbrial assembly. Amino acid residue substitution of the N-terminal cysteine residues (C66S and C128S) of MrpH abolished the receptor-binding activity (hemagglutinating ability) of MrpH but allowed normal fimbrial assembly, supporting the notion that MrpH was the functional MR/P hemagglutinin. Immunogold electron microscopy of P. mirabilis HI4320 revealed that MrpH was located at the tip of MR/P fimbriae, also consistent with its role in receptor binding. The isogenic mrpH::aphA mutant of HI4320 was less able to colonize the urine, bladder, and kidneys in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection (P < 0.01), and therefore MR/P fimbriae contribute significantly to bacterial colonization in mice. While there are similarities between P. mirabilis MR/P and E. coli P fimbriae, there are more notable differences: (i) synthesis of the MrpH adhesin is required to initiate fimbrial assembly, (ii) MR/P fimbriae confer an aggregation phenotype, (iii) site-directed mutation of specific residues can abolish receptor binding but allows fimbrial assembly, and (iv) mutation of the adhesin gene abolishes virulence in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection.
TI  - Substrate-specific binding of hook-associated proteins by FlgN and FliT, putative chaperones for flagellum assembly.
AB  - During flagellum assembly by motile enterobacteria, flagellar axial proteins destined for polymerization into the cell surface structure are thought to be exported through the 25-30 A flagellum central channel as partially unfolded monomers. How are premature folding and oligomerization in the cytosol prevented? We have shown previously using hyperflagellated Proteus mirabilis and a motile but non-swarming flgN transposon mutant that the apparently cytosolic 16. 5 kDa flagellar protein FlgN facilitates efficient flagellum filament assembly. Here, we investigate further whether FlgN, predicted to contain a C-terminal amphipathic helix typical of type III export chaperones, acts as a chaperone for axial proteins. Incubation of soluble radiolabelled FlgN from Salmonella typhimurium with nitrocellulose-immobilized cell lysates of wild-type S. typhimurium and a non-flagellate class 1 flhDC mutant indicated that FlgN binds to flagellar proteins. Identical affinity blot analysis of culture supernatants from the wild-type and flhDC, flgI, flgK, flgL, fliC or fliD flagellar mutants showed that FlgN binds to the flagellar hook-associated proteins (HAPs) FlgK and FlgL. This was confirmed by blotting artificially expressed individual HAPs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of axial proteins secreted into the culture medium by the original P. mirabilis flgN mutant demonstrated that export of FlgK and FlgL was specifically reduced, with concomitant increased release of unpolymerized flagellin (FliC), the immediately distal component of the flagellum. These data suggest that FlgN functions as an export chaperone for FlgK and FlgL. Parallel experiments showed that FliT, a similarly small (14 kDa), potentially helical flagellar protein, binds specifically to the flagellar filament cap protein, FliD (HAP2), indicating that it too might be an export chaperone. Flagellar axial proteins all contain amphipathic helices at their termini. Removal of the HAP C-terminal helical domains abolished binding by FlgN and FliT in each case, and polypeptides comprising each of the HAP C-termini were specifically bound by FlgN and FliT. We suggest that FlgN and FliT are substrate-specific flagellar chaperones that prevent oligomerization of the HAPs by binding to their helical domains before export.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Identification of UreR binding sites in the Enterobacteriaceae plasmid-encoded and Proteus mirabilis urease gene operons.
AB  - The closely related Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacterlaceae plasmid-encoded urease genes are positively regulated by the AraC-like transcriptional activator UreR. In the presence of the effector molecule urea, UreR promotes transcription of ureD, the initial gene in the urease operon, and increases transcription of the divergently transcribed ureR. Here, we identify UreR-specific binding sites in the ureRp-ureDp intergenic regions. Recombinant UreR (rUreR) was expressed and purified, and gel shift and DNase I protection assays were performed with this protein. These analyses indicated that there are two distinct rUreR binding sites in both the plasmid-encoded and P. mirabilis ureRp-ureDp intergenic regions. A consensus binding site of TA/GT/CA/TT/GC/TTA/TT/AATTG was predicted from the DNase I protection assays. Although rUreR bound to the specific DNA binding site in both the presence and the absence of urea, the dissociation rate constant k-1 of the rUreR-DNA complex interaction was measurably different when urea was present. In the absence of urea, the dissociation of the protein-DNA complexes, for both ureRp and ureDp, was complete at the earliest time point, and it was not possible to determine a rate. In the presence of urea, dissociation was measurable with a k-1 for the rUreR-ureRp interaction of 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-2) s-1 and a k-1 for the rUreR-ureDp interaction of 2.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) s-1. This corresponds to a half-life of the ureRp-rUreR interaction of 58 s, and a half-life of the ureDp-rUreR interaction of 4 min 26 s. A model describing a potential role for urea in the activation of these promoters is proposed.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of some 2,6-disubstituted 4-anilinoquinazolines.
AB  - Two synthetic 2,6-disubstituted 4-anilinoquinazolines exerted a significant effect on the G+ bacteria Bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. None of 12 tested derivatives influenced Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Derivatives having the aromatic ring non-substituted or substituted by bromine, the pyrimidine ring by phenyl, morpholine or piperidine and the aniline skeleton non-substituted or substituted by methyl or amino group exerted a considerable antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Use of pefloxacin in the treatment of patients with purulent wounds of soft tissues].
AB  - Pefloxacin was used in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infection in a dose of 400 mg orally twice a day for 10-12 days. As the monotherapy it was applied to 15 patients. 7 patients with clinical signs of non-clostridial anaerobic infection were treated with pefloxacin in combination with intravenous metronidazole. Pefloxacin was highly efficient in 96 per cent of the cases with extensive posttraumatic purulent wounds with and without bone affection, acute purulent wounds of the soft tissue, purulent wounds of the soft tissues in diabetic patients, trophic or decubitus ulcer. 266 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp, were tested and 75 to 100 per cent of them was shown to be susceptible to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the same time the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The pathogen eradication and eradication with superinfection in the cases treated with pefloxacin amounted to 92 per cent. The drug tolerance was good. No clinically significant adverse events were recorded.
TI  - A novel membrane protein influencing cell shape and multicellular swarming of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Swarming in Proteus mirabilis is characterized by the coordinated surface migration of multicellular rafts of highly elongated, hyperflagellated swarm cells. We describe a transposon mutant, MNS185, that was unable to swarm even though vegetative cells retained normal motility and the ability to differentiate into swarm cells. However, these elongated cells were irregularly curved and had variable diameters, suggesting that the migration defect results from the inability of these deformed swarm cells to align into multicellular rafts. The transposon was inserted at codon 196 of a 228-codon gene that lacks recognizable homologs. Multiple copies of the wild-type gene, called ccmA, for curved cell morphology, restored swarming to the mutant. The 25-kDa CcmA protein is predicted to span the inner membrane twice, with its C-terminal major domain being present in the cytoplasm. Membrane localization was confirmed both by immunoblotting and by electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled sections. Two forms of CcmA were identified for wild-type P. mirabilis; they were full-length integral membrane CcmA1 and N-terminally truncated peripheral membrane CcmA2, both present at approximately 20-fold higher concentrations in swarm cells. Differentiated MNS185 mutant cells contained wild-type levels of the C-terminally truncated versions of both proteins. Elongated cells of a ccmA null mutant were less misshapen than those of MNS185 and were able to swarm, albeit more slowly than wild-type cells. The truncated CcmA proteins may therefore interfere with normal morphogenesis, while the wild-type proteins, which are not essential for swarming, may enhance migration by maintaining the linearity of highly elongated cells. Consistent with this view, overexpression of the ccmA gene caused cells of both Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis to become enlarged and ellipsoidal.
TI  - The penicillins.
AB  - The penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. In general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. The initial introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. Subsequently, the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and bacampicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum initially included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella, Salmonella, Listeria, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. The search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin and ticarcillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, and piperacillin). Finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam) and an aminopenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra by inhibiting certain beta-lactamases (non-group 1) of resistant bacteria. The development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, and resistant to beta-lactamases and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.
TI  - The isoflavone genistein inhibits internalization of enteric bacteria by cultured Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes.
AB  - The dietary isoflavone genistein is the focus of much research involving its role as a potential therapeutic agent in a variety of diseases, including cancer and heart disease. However, there is recent evidence that dietary genistein may also have an inhibitory effect on extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria. To study the effects of genistein on bacterial adherence and internalization by confluent enterocytes, Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes (cultivated for 15-18 d and 21-24 d, respectively) were pretreated for 1 h with 0, 30, 100, or 300 micromol/L genistein, followed by 1-h incubation with pure cultures of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, or Escherichia coli. Pretreatment of Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes with genistein inhibited bacterial internalization in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0.60-0.79). Compared to untreated enterocytes, 1-h pretreatment with 300 micromol/L genistein was generally associated with decreased bacterial internalization (P < 0. 05) without a corresponding decrease in bacterial adherence. Using Caco-2 cell cultures, decreased bacterial internalization was associated with increased integrity of enterocyte tight junctions [measured by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)], with alterations in the distribution of enterocyte perijunctional actin filaments (visualized by fluorescein-labeled phalloidin), and with abrogation of the decreased TEER associated with S. typhimurium and E. coli incubation with the enterocytes (P < 0.01). Thus, genistein was associated with inhibition of enterocyte internalization of enteric bacteria by a mechanism that might be related to the integrity of the enterocyte tight junctions, suggesting that genistein might function as a barrier-sustaining agent, inhibiting extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of synthetic bismuth compounds against Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by C. difficile. We have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their biological activities against C. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including Helicobacter pylori. Here, we report on the activities of six compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against C. difficile, and some of the compounds have MICs of less than 1 microgram/ml. Also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. C. difficile and H. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. Testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. Killing curves for C. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by C. difficile. Energy dispersive spectroscopy X-ray microanalysis of C. difficile cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. Internalized bismuth was not observed in C. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. The nature of the carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like C. difficile.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The antibacterial effects of tumescent liposuction fluid.
AB  - Tumescent liposuction is currently one of the most commonly performed aesthetic procedures. Despite the variable use of preoperative antibiotics, infection is uncommon. Prior works suggest that the low incidence of infection may be due to lidocaine's antibacterial properties. However, these properties have only been demonstrated using concentrations of lidocaine above 0.8%, significantly higher than those used in tumescent liposuction. The purpose of this study was to determine if the commonly used tumescent fluid containing 0.1% lidocaine, 1:1000,000 epinephrine, and 0.012 mEq sodium bicarbonate possesses antibacterial activity. Using the broth microdilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were determined after exposure to either lidocaine, epinephrine, bicarbonate, or the combination of all three agents. To determine if there were significant growth differences not detectable by the broth microdilution method, bacterial concentrations were obtained through the use of a spectrophotometer, and significant differences from the controls were calculated by one-way analysis of variance. To determine if prolonged exposure to the tumescent mix would alter bacterial growth, a Killing Time study was also undertaken. The results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration of lidocaine was not less than 0.5% for any of the bacteria, whereas the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of the combined solution was 0.25%. The lowest inhibitory concentration as determined by spectrophotometric analysis for the combined solution was 0.13% (p < 0.01). Analysis of the Killing Time data revealed no inhibition of bacterial growth over time. In conclusion, lidocaine, epinephrine, and bicarbonate do exhibit antibacterial properties at high concentrations. However, the commonly used tumescent mixture containing dilute concentrations of these agents does not significantly inhibit the growth of commonly encountered bacteria.
TI  - Absence of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae antigens within inflammatory bowel disease tissues.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli, listeria, and streptococcal antigens have been found in Crohn's disease tissues. Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. The presence of these bacterial antigens in Crohn's granulomas would be of aetiological interest, while their presence in ulcers alone would be more likely to indicate secondary infection. AIM: To investigate inflammatory bowel disease tissues for the presence of these bacteria. METHODS: Formalin fixed, paraffin processed sections from 53 patients (19 ulcerative colitis, 23 Crohn's disease; 11 normal tissues from cancer resections) were studied by immunohistochemistry. Control tissue consisted of normal human small bowel injected submucosally with either E coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes K2, 3, 17, 21, 26, 36, and 50, and colonic biopsies from a child with E coli 0114 infection. Tissues were stained by Gram-Twort, and with specific antibodies for E coli (Dako B357), L monocytogenes (Difco 2302-50), and K pneumoniae (Biogenesis 5580-5208) using an immunoperoxidase technique. RESULTS: Positive staining for E coli was observed on the luminal surface epithelium and in ulcers in 35% of Crohn's disease patients, 26% of ulcerative colitis patients, and no normal controls. Superficial staining for L monocytogenes was observed in one case of ulcerative colitis only. Staining for K pneumoniae was observed in one case of ulcerative colitis and one of Crohn's disease. No granulomas, giant cells, or germinal centres stained positively for any of the three bacterial antigens. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support a primary role for E coli, L monocytogenes, and K pneumoniae in inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of E coli antigens in ulcers suggests secondary infection in these lesions.
TI  - Characterization and nucleotide sequence of CARB-6, a new carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from Vibrio cholerae.
AB  - A clinical strain of Vibrio cholerae non-O1 non-O139 isolated in France produced  a new beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.35. The purified enzyme, with a molecular mass of 33,000 Da, was characterized. Its kinetic constants show it to be a carbenicillin-hydrolyzing enzyme comparable to the five previously reported CARB beta-lactamases and to SAR-1, another carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that has a pI of 4.9 and that is produced by a V. cholerae strain from Tanzania. This beta-lactamase is designated CARB-6, and the gene for CARB-6 could not be transferred to Escherichia coli K-12 by conjugation. The nucleotide sequence of the structural gene was determined by direct sequencing of PCR-generated fragments from plasmid DNA with four pairs of primers covering the whole sequence of the reference CARB-3 gene. The gene encodes a 288-amino-acid protein that shares 94% homology with the CARB-1, CARB-2, and CARB-3 enzymes, 93% homology with the Proteus mirabilis N29 enzyme, and 86.5% homology with the CARB-4 enzyme. The sequence of CARB-6 differs from those of CARB-3, CARB-2, CARB-1, N29, and CARB-4 at 15, 16, 17, 19, and 37 amino acid positions, respectively. All these mutations are located in the C-terminal region of the sequence and at the surface of the molecule, according to the crystal structure of the Staphylococcus aureus PC-1 beta-lactamase.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - Cellulitis due to Escherichia coli in three immunocompromised subjects.
AB  - In adults, cellulitis is usually caused by group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. However, in patients with underlying disease, it may be caused by other organisms, such as Acinetobacter, Clostridium septicum, Enterobacter, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis or Escherichia coli. We report three cases of cellulitis of the lower legs where E. coli was the causative bacterial organism. It is important to suspect E. coli as a causative organism if blistering cellulitis occurs, especially in patients with underlying diseases.
TI  - Complicated urinary tract infection: analysis of 179 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence, bacteriology,  management and outcome of complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. METHODS: Between June, 1993, and July, 1994, medical records of 2,566 patients admitted to the Division of Urology, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patient, 1,322 had a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 607 were admitted for renal stones, 496 for ureteral stones, 75 for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder, 47 for renal tumors and 19 for TCC of the ureter. Among all patients studied, 179 (6.98%) acquired a complicated UTI. Of these, 81 were admitted for BPH, 46 for renal stones, 42 for ureteral stones, five for TCC of the urinary bladder, three for renal tumors and two for TCC of the ureter. RESULTS: Of the 179 patients with complicated UTIs, 155 were men and 24 were women. The urine culture positive rate was 76.0% (136/179) and the most common bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The principle mode of treatment included parenteral antibiotics and urinary diversion (percutaneous nephrostomy and Foley catheterization), when necessary. The infection control rate for these complicated UTIs was 96.3% for BPH, 95.5% for renal stone, 97.6% for ureteral stone, 80% for TCC of the urinary bladder, 100% for renal tumor and 100% for TCC of the ureter. Mortality due to complicated UTI was 3.9% (7/179). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the prognosis of complicated UTI is good if diagnosis and appropriate treatment are given promptly. Early drainage to relieve obstruction and intravenous antibiotics are initially necessary. Surgical intervention is required to resolve functional or structural abnormalities after the UTI has been controlled.
TI  - Characterisation of CMY-4, an AmpC-type plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in a Tunisian clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A strain of Proteus mirabilis resistant to beta-lactams, including cefoxitin, was isolated from the urine of a woman from Tunisia. Its antibiotic susceptibility pattern and that of the Escherichia coli transconjugant suggested the presence of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Two bands of beta-lactamase activity (pI 5.4 and 9.2) were detected by isoelectric focusing. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the AmpC-type enzyme was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence was 98-99% identical to CMY-3 and to those of the plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamases originated from Citrobacter freundii and 97% identical to the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase of a Tunisian clinical isolate of C. freundii. This enzyme differs from CMY-2 by one substitution (Arg for Trp at position 221) and from CMY-3 by two substitutions (Glu for Gly at position 42 and Ser for Asn at position 363) and we propose the denomination CMY-4.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro susceptibility of hospital bacterial isolates to piperacillin and tazocin (piperacillin/tazobactam].
AB  - Due to increasing frequency of infections caused by pathogens that are resistant  to beta-lactam antibiotics, combinations of such antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors were introduced into therapy in last few years. Tazobactam is the most potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. The purpose of the study was to evaluate in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin and piperacillin with tazobactam of 256 isolates cultured from biological samples obtained from 203 patients. The biological materials obtained were as follows: urine (44.9%), post-operative and post-traumatic wound swabs (27.3%), BAL (12.1%), blood (6.6%), drain swabs and other (5.5%). The isolates predominantly found were Escherichia coli (22.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.0%), Staphylococcus aureus MSSA (13.7%), Proteus mirabilis (11.7%) and other. There were 95.5% of strains found susceptible to piperacillin with tazobactam and only 4.3% resistant ones. On the other hand, piperacillin only susceptible strains were 59.4% and resistant ones in 40.6%. Great differences in susceptibility to examined antimicrobial agents were observed in Enterobacteriaceae family and Staphylococcus (MSS) genus. There were no differences in susceptibility to piperacillin and tazobactam and piperacillin alone in anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae strains and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Procaryotic expression of single-chain variable-fragment (scFv) antibodies: secretion in L-form cells of Proteus mirabilis leads to active product and overcomes the limitations of periplasmic expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recently it has been demonstrated that L-form cells of Proteus mirabilis (L VI),  which lack a periplasmic compartment, can be efficiently used in the production and secretion of heterologous proteins. In search of novel expression systems for recombinant antibodies, we compared levels of single-chain variable-fragment (scFv) production in Escherichia coli JM109 and P. mirabilis L VI, which express four distinct scFvs of potential clinical interest that show differences in levels of expression and in their tendencies to form aggregates upon periplasmic expression. Production of all analyzed scFvs in E. coli was limited by the severe toxic effect of the heterologous product as indicated by inhibition of culture growth and the formation of insoluble aggregates in the periplasmic space, limiting the yield of active product. In contrast, the L-form cells exhibited nearly unlimited growth under the tested production conditions for all scFvs examined. Moreover, expression experiments with P. mirabilis L VI led to scFv concentrations in the range of 40 to 200 mg per liter of culture medium (corresponding to volume yields 33- to 160-fold higher than those with E. coli JM109), depending on the expressed antibody. In a translocation inhibition experiment the secretion of the scFv constructs was shown to be an active transport coupled to the signal cleavage. We suppose that this direct release of the newly synthesized product into a large volume of the growth medium favors folding into the native active structure. The limited aggregation of scFv observed in the P. mirabilis L VI supernatant (occurring in a first-order-kinetics manner) was found to be due to intrinsic features of the scFv and not related to the expression process of the host cells. The P. mirabilis L VI supernatant was found to be advantageous for scFv purification. A two-step chromatography procedure led to homogeneous scFv with high antigen binding activity as revealed from binding experiments with eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Use of cell wall-less bacteria (L-forms) for efficient expression and secretion of heterologous gene products.
AB  - In spite of many efforts and achievements to optimize the prokaryotic expression  systems, there are still general and specific problems in obtaining sufficient yields of the functionally active gene products. The main problems concern the formation of inclusion bodies, incorrect folding, toxicity for the producer cells and degradation by proteases. One way to overcome these problems is with expression systems alternative to those of Escherichia coli. For the first time, cell wall-less L-form bacteria were used to establish such an alternative expression system and test its practicability. The results showed that various recombinant proteins can be synthesized in considerable amounts as soluble, functionally active products with these cell wall-less strains.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - The prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, over an 11-year period. Fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. The organisms most frequently involved were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter. Rarer pathogens included Citrobacter species, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. All patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. The mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. Other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. Despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.
TI  - A quantitative study of genital skin flora and urinary colonization in spinal cord injured patients.
AB  - This study was performed to define the relation between colonization of genital skin flora and bacteriuria in spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Twenty-seven female and 23 male spinal cord injured patients were included in the study. Patients were evaluated regarding their type of bladder management, educational status, level and degree of the spinal cord lesion. Quantitative cultures were obtained from the perineum labium/dorsum of penis, external meatus of urethra, and urine. We investigated whether the organisms isolated from urine were also present in one or more skin sites in every patient. In total 54 identical bacterial isolates were observed both from urine and one or more skin sites in 43 of the patients. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus stuartii were the most common bacterial isolates. The distribution of identical colonization of genital skin flora with urine were as follows: 30 in urethra, one in perineum, four in urethra and perineum, nine in urethra and labium/dorsum of penis, and 10 in both three skin sites. Identical colonization of both perineum and labium/dorsum of penis with urine were significantly higher in female patients than those of males (P = 0.037, P = 0.003, respectively). No significant difference was found in the presence/distribution of colonization with respect to type of bladder management, educational status, and neurologic status. These results demonstrate the importance of the urethra, perineum, and labium/dorsum of penis as a source of bacteria causing urinary infection in spinal cord injured patients.
TI  - Antibodies to urinary tract pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions.
AB  - Chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is a significant problem or patients with spinal cord lesions (SCL). UTIs are thought to be a major factor in the development of reduced renal function. To investigate the pathogenesis 151 patients with SCL were included in this study during a 7 year period. Results of intravenous pyelography and isotope renography were recorded as well as the bladder emptying methods. One to seven blood samples were obtained from each patient and tested for plasma creatinine, and the presence of precipitating antibodies against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found significant correlation between duration of SCL and precipitating antibodies against urinary tract pathogens (PAU) (r = 0.23, P < 0.005), between plasma creatinine and PAU in patients with spina bifida (r = 0.64, P < 0.01), between PAU and the number of positive urine cultures (r = 0.17; P < 0.05) and a relation between abnormal urological findings and PAU. In addition, the PAU was significantly higher in patients with indwelling urethral catheters (P < 0.001). Thus it seems that PAU can be of prognostic value in SCL patients, and PAU might be an indicator for intensified treatment of recurrent UTI.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Comparative activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - beta-Lactam resistance on the part of the Enterobacteriaceae causes serious therapeutic problems in our institutions due to their production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESbetaLs). We studied the in vitro activity of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams against 71 clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae which produced TEM- and SHV-derivative ESbetaLs. Of the single drugs and combinations tested, piperacillin/tazobactam proved to be the most effective. Piperacillin/tazobactam was highly active against Proteus mirabilis, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.125 to 16 microg/ml; Escherichia coli (MICs from 2 to 16 microg/ml) and Serratia marcescens (MICs from 4 to 8 microg/ml), while its activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae ESbetaL producers turned out to be closely related to the type and the amount of enzyme produced, the MIC ranging from 1 to 128 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam was stronger than that of ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and the combination shared favorable in vitro activity properties against the ESbetaL producers with imipenem which, however, should be kept as reserve product.
TI  - Carbapenem-induced endotoxin release in gram-negative bacterial sepsis rat models.
AB  - The carbapenem-induced endotoxin release was evaluated using experimental models  of gram-negative bacterial sepsis in Wistar rats. Infections with Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis resulted in an increase of the plasma endotoxin concentration after treatment with ceftazidime and carbapenems including imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem. Except for P. aeruginosa, the plasma endotoxin concentrations after carbapenem treatment were significantly lower than those after ceftazidime treatment. It is noteworthy that treatment of P. aeruginosa sepsis with meropenem or biapenem induced significantly more endotoxin release than other carbapenems and the endotoxin concentrations induced by these carbapenems reached those of ceftazidime treatment. The plasma endotoxin concentrations appeared to correlate with the reduction of platelet counts and the elevation of both glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase values.
TI  - Activities of LL-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  - Human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (HNP-1 to HNP-4) and the alpha-helical peptide LL-37. We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Transfer of resistance to oxy-imino-cephalosporins and of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase productions in Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from infected neonates.
AB  - In this communication, we describe the occurrence of strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to cephalosporins of all generations and to aztreonam due to their production of Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases (ESBLs), in two hospitals in Slovakia. They were found to transfer the genetic determinants of resistance of cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam and of ESBL production to suitable recipient strains of Escherichia coli K-12 No. 3110 and Proteus mirabilis P-38. Six donor K. pneumoniae strains were collected from six prematurely born babies gradually infected with strains of K. pneumoniae resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. All six strains of K. pneumoniae gave an identical pattern in ESBL testing (double-disk diffusion test). The second cycle of transfers to nalidixin-resistant E. coli K-12 No. 185 nal+ also confirmed that all transconjugants were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. We conclude that a single gene was transferred from donor strains which confers 'en bloc' the resistance to the beta-lactams tested. Four strains of K. pneumoniae produced a uniform type of ESBI. Although with different quantitative expression. All transconjugants tested produced identical types of ESBL as did the donor strains of K. pneumoniae. This transfer of an identical pattern of ESBL production was confirmed also in the second cycle of transfers. Cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam were actively hydrolysed (as shown by the relative rate of hydrolysis [Vmax]) by strains of K. pneumoniae as well as by transconjugant colonies and clavulanate inhibited the hydrolysis of these beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Novel genes that upregulate the Proteus mirabilis flhDC master operon controlling flagellar biogenesis and swarming.
AB  - By screening for restoration of multicellular migration in a non-swarming but motile Proteus mirabilis mutant lacking the FIgN facilitator of flagella assembly, we identified four distinct genes that, in trans and multicopy, increased flagella production and cell length. Each of the genes upregulated expression of the flhDC master operon that controls flagellar biogenesis, cell division and swarming, not only in the mutant but also in the wild type. The genes were named umoA, umoB, umoC and umoD. Disruption of each of the wild-type chromosomal umo genes caused corresponding reductions in swarming and cell elongation, which correlated with decreased expression of the flhDC operon. The umoA, umoB, umoC and umoD genes are not closely linked, and only umoB is part of an operon. The sequences of the calculated gene products, UmoA (20.6 kDa), UmoB (78.0 kDa), UmoC (15.2 kDa) and UmoD (19.2 kDa), contain putative N-terminal secretion signals and predict a location in the cell membranes or periplasm. UmoB and UmoD have sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli uncharacterized open reading frames YrfF and YcfJ respectively; UmoA and UmoC have no known homologues. The umoB and umoC gene transcripts were present at very low levels, but umoA and umoD expression was similar to that of flhDC and increased in parallel with flhDC expression during differentiation into elongated hyperflagellated swarm cells. Like flhDC, umoA and umoD expression was subject to negative feedback in aflagellar assembly mutant lacking the FlhA inner membrane component of the export machinery. Assays of umo gene expression and cross-complementation indicated that the umo genes do not act in sequence within a pathway to upregulate flhDC, but revealed that umoA and umoD are reciprocally upregulated by FlhDC. Our findings strengthen the picture of the flhDC master operon as a major assimilatory checkpoint in Proteus mirabilis and other Gram-negative bacteria and expand the view of a complex regulatory network coupled to flagellar biogenesis.
TI  - A rapid method for determination of in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics with a bulk acoustic wave bacterial growth biosensor.
AB  - A novel bulk acoustic wave (BAW) bacterial growth biosensor was developed to study in vitro susceptibility by continuous monitoring of disturbances of bacterial growth at low antibiotic concentrations, followed by the accurate and rapid estimation of growth kinetic parameters and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The susceptibilities of bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pr. morganii and Pr. mirabilis, to various antibiotics, e.g. penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin and cefotaxime, were investigated, respectively, and the MICs were rapidly determined with a higher reproducibility than the conventional broth micro-dilution technique (BMDT). The effects of cell constant of conductivity electrode, pH and temperature on bacterial growth and biosensor signals were discussed in detail. The proposed method offers an effective alternative to the conventional methods.
TI  - Asymmetric reduction of racemic sulfoxides by dimethyl sulfoxide reductases from  Rhodobacter capsulatus, Escherichia coli and Proteus species.
AB  - The enantioselective reduction of racemic sulfoxides by dimethyl sulfoxide reductases from Rhodobacter capsulatus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris was investigated. Purified dimethyl sulfoxide reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalysed the selective removal of (S)-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide from a racemic mixture of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide and resulted in an 88% recovery of enantiomerically pure (R)-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide. Rhodobacter capsulatus was shown to be able to grow photoheterotrophically in the presence of certain chiral sulfoxides under conditions where a sulfoxide is needed as an electron sink. Whole cells of Rhodobacter capsulatus were shown to catalyse the enantioselective reduction of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide, ethyl 2-pyridyl sulfoxide, methylthiomethyl methyl sulfoxide and methoxymethyl phenyl sulfoxide. Similarly, whole cells of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris reduced these sulfoxides but with opposite enantioselectivity.
TI  - Evidence that aminoguanidine inhibits endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation was investigated by using its specific blocker aminoguanidine in 46 albino mice (25-35 g) allocated into four groups. METHODS: The first group received intraperitoneal saline (control; 0.9 per cent w v(-1) sodium chloride 1 ml kg(-1); n=6), the second group intraperitoneal endotoxin (Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide 055:B5 20 mg kg(-1); n=19), the third group intraperitoneal aminoguanidine (20 mg kg(-1), 20 min before and 12 h after saline; n=6) and the fourth group both endotoxin and aminoguanidine intraperitoneally (n=15). Some 24 h later, the animals were anaesthetized with ether and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture together with mesenteric lymph node (MLN), spleen and liver specimens under aseptic conditions. Specimens were then cultured to determine the presence of colony-forming units as an index of bacterial translocation. RESULTS: No bacterial growth was detected in samples from the first and third groups. Colony-forming bacteria were found in ten of 14 MLN samples, eight of 14 spleens, four of 14 livers and three of 14 peripheral blood samples in the second group, with E. coli being the predominant pathogen. In contrast, in the fourth group, colony-forming bacteria were found in only three of 14 MLN samples (P=0.02 versus the second group), three of 14 spleens and one of 14 liver specimens. None of the values in the fourth group was significantly different from those in the saline control group. CONCLUSION: The inhibition of iNOS during endotoxaemia by its specific blocker aminoguanidine attenuates the incidence of bacterial translocation in mice. These results may be exploited clinically for the prophylaxis and treatment of septic states.
TI  - Identification of a novel transcription regulator from Proteus mirabilis, PMTR, revealed a possible role of YJAI protein in balancing zinc in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Zinc is an essential trace element required for structural integrity and functional activity of numerous proteins, yet mechanisms by which cells regulate zinc concentration are poorly understood. Here, we identified a gene from Proteus mirabilis that encodes a 135-amino acid residue protein, PMTR (P. mirabilis transcription regulator), a new member of the MerR family of transcription activators. Transformation of Escherichia coli with PMTR-carrying vectors specifically increases cell tolerance to zinc, suggesting the role of PMTR in zinc homeostasis. In response to zinc, PMTR-containing cells robustly accumulate a 12-kDa protein, the amount of which correlates with the cells' ability to grow at high zinc concentrations. The 12-kDa protein is not induced in the presence of Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, or Fe2+, indicating that the PMTR-dependent expression of the 12-kDa protein is specifically regulated by zinc. The 12-kDa protein was identified as the C-terminal fragment of E. coli protein YJAI, and was shown to contain two zinc-binding motifs. Metal-affinity chromatography and 65Zn blotting assay confirmed the ability of the 12-kDa protein to bind zinc specifically (zinc > cobalt >> cadmium). We propose that YJAI is an important component of the zinc-balancing mechanism in E. coli, the up-regulation of which with PMTR results in an increased tolerance to zinc.
TI  - Cloning and characterisation of the Proteus mirabilis xerD gene.
AB  - The Xer site-specific recombination system is involved in the stable maintenance  of replicons (certain plasmids and chromosomes) in Escherichia coli and other bacteria by converting multimers into monomers. This system requires a cis-acting DNA sequence (the chromosomal dif site or the ColE1 cer site) and two trans-acting factors: the XerC and XerD recombinases, which belong to the lambda integrase family of tyrosine site-specific recombinases. In addition, in order to resolve plasmid multimers into monomers, two additional factors are required: the ArgR and PepA proteins. We have previously shown the presence of xerC and xerD genes (and their function) by Southern hybridisation and by in vivo recombination in a wide variety of Enterobacteriaceac. We have now cloned and sequenced the xerD gene of Proteus mirabilis using degenerate and inverse PCR methods. This gene encodes a tyrosine recombinase which is highly similar to the E. coli XerD recombinase, is capable of complementing an E. coli xerD mutant, and displays sequence-specific DNA binding activity.
TI  - Further studies of transferable antibiotic resistance in strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from four clinical settings in three countries.
AB  - This paper describes transferability of antibiotic resistance determinants in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem, cefotaxime and ceftazidime obtained from different clinical settings in three different countries. Two strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli K-12 and Proteus mirabilis P-38) and two strains of P. aeruginosa (PAO and ML) were used as recipient strains. The conjugative transfer of resistance was very specific, i.e. donor strains of P. aeruginosa transferred individual resistance determinants either to recipient strains E. coli K-12 and P. mirabilis P-38, or to P. aeruginosa PAO or ML. In a case when three different species (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were isolated from a single patient, a block of resistance determinants was transferred both to Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa recipients. A single plasmid with rather specific properties was suspected of being exchanged among strains of these different species. It was recommended to study the overall situation of transferability of individual resistance determinants in bacterial strains belonging to various species of nosocomial bacteria, especially of P. aeruginosa, by using a rather specific methodology.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to self-reinforced polyglycolic acid and self-reinforced polylactic acid 96 urological spiral stents in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial adherence to biodegradable self-reinforced polyglycolic acid (SR-PGA) and self-reinforced poly-DL-lactic acid (SR-PLA 96) spiral stents in vitro. They are used as temporary urethral stents in urology. Gold-plated metal wire, polyurethane and latex were used as controls. Materials were incubated up to 28 days in artificial urine, after which a bacterial suspension was added. After detaching by sonication the adhesive bacteria were analysed as colony forming units (CFUs) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Adhesion was more significantly correlated to stent bacterial type than to the tested material in both assays. No encrustation was seen on SR-PGA or SR-PLA 96. SR-PGA and SR-PLA 96 had no effect on the bacterial growth. In conclusion, the bacterial properties are equally or more important than the material properties in the adhesion process.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis inhibit the perinuclear but not the circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA) are found  in 48%-83% of serum samples from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Their pathogenic role and initiating stimuli are unknown. In contrast to patients with vasculitides and ANCA reactivities, the antibodies in UC patients do not react with myeloperoxidase (MPO) or proteinase 3 (PR3). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether bacterial species of the intestinal tract and other sources could interfere with P-ANCA in sera from patients with UC. METHODS: Seventeen P-ANCA-positive and anti-MPO-negative serum samples from patients with UC were tested with Escherichia coli 014 and Staphylococcus aureus Wood 46. Six of these serum samples with different P-ANCA titres were selected to test further the influence of 15 different gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial strains. Six anti-MPO positive P-ANCA, 5 anti-PR3 positive C-ANCA, and 10 antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive serum samples were used as controls. The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were analysed by an indirect immunofluorescence method (IIF) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils, and the ANAs were tested by IIF on HEp-2 cells or rat liver tissues. The bacteria used in the experiments were either live or killed by formalin or glutaraldehyde fixation or heated at 80 degrees C for 30 min. The test was first performed as a bacterial absorption test with sedimented organisms and then at various temperatures with the supernatant from suspension of live bacteria. RESULTS: Both MPO-positive and MPO-negative P-ANCA reactivity was abolished by absorption of patient sera with live E. coli and Proteus mirabilis but not with bacteria representing members of 10 other species, suggesting that antibody reactivity was absorbed away. However, continued experiments indicated that the inhibition of P-ANCA was not due to classic antigen-antibody interactions but rather to decomposition of the antigenic substrate of the neutrophils by factors present in the supernatants of live E. coli and P. mirabilis. The activity of the supernatant was temperature-dependent, with strong activity at room temperature and 37 degrees C, no activity at 0 degrees C, and abolished by mild heat treatment (56 degrees or 60 degrees C). No activity was shown in the supernatants from bacteria treated with formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: Soluble material from live E. coli and P. mirabilis has the capacity to decompose the antigenic substrate of neutrophils responsible for both MPO-positive and MPO-negative P-ANCA, most probably brought about through enzymatic activity. Anti PR3-positive C-ANCA were not affected, which suggests substrate specificity of the proposed enzymatic activity.
TI  - A comparison between single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril) and a 5-day course of trimethoprim in the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - This study is a comparison of the microbiological and clinical efficacy of single-dose fosfomycin trometamol therapy and a 5 day course of trimethoprim in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in female patients. Urine dip-slide samples were obtained from 547 female patients aged 18-65 by 22 General Practitioners (GPs) participating in the study from 21 centres in the UK. All patients were diagnosed as having a urinary tract infection by their GP on the basis of history and clinical examination. Patients were randomised to receive either single dose fosfomycin trometamol or a 5 day course of trimethoprim in a 2:1 ratio. Patients who had significant bacteriuria (> or = 10(5) c.f.u/ml) at the first visit (300) were included in the microbiological analysis. The two commonest urinary pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim resistance was more frequent amongst E. coli isolates whereas fosfomycin trometamol resistance was more common amongst S. saprophyticus isolates. Microbiological cure was demonstrated in 83.3% of the trimethoprim treated group and 83% of the fosfomycin trometamol treated group. Persistence of the infecting bacteria was seen in 17% of each treatment arm.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. Urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. Enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the HPLC assay. The total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. The mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. The antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (UBT), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (E. coli ATCC 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). For the E. coli ATCC 25,922, the organism with the lowest MIC, median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. For the five uropathogens (with increasing MICs: K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis), the UBTs decreased in general, according to MICs, demonstrating the same relations of UBTs for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (P. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher UBTs than enoxacin. The minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (MUBC), as derived from urinary concentrations, and UBTs showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding MBCs as determined in Mueller Hinton broth. In conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as UBTs, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting UBTs followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). A dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. Only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. Therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated UTI could be worth testing.
TI  - beta-Lactamases responsible for resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis isolates recovered in South Africa.
AB  - Although resistance to the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins among members of the  family Enterobacteriaceae lacking inducible beta-lactamases occurs virtually worldwide, little is known about this problem among isolates recovered in South Africa. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins recovered from patients in various parts of South Africa over a 3-month period were investigated for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was evaluated by using the double-disk test, and the beta-lactamases were characterized by spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays and an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points and general substrate or inhibitor characteristics. DNA amplification and sequencing were performed to confirm the identities of these enzymes. The P. mirabilis and E. coli isolates were found to produce TEM-26-type, SHV-2, and SHV-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. An AmpC-related enzyme which had a pI of 8.0 and which conferred resistance to cefoxitin as well as the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was found in a strain of K. pneumoniae. This is the first study which has identified organisms producing different extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from South Africa and the first report describing strains of P. mirabilis producing a TEM-26-type enzyme. The variety of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases found among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from major medical centers in South Africa is troubling and adds to the growing list of countries where these enzymes pose a serious problem for antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of norfloxacin 800 mg once-daily versus norfloxacin 400 mg twice-daily in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial.
AB  - Norfloxacin 400 mg twice-a-day has proven to be effective and safe in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI). Since previous pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate the feasibility of using norfloxacin 800 mg once-daily, and this scheme is assumed to improve patient compliance, a double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of norfloxacin 800 mg once-daily (Group A) versus norfloxacin 400 mg twice-daily (Group B) in the treatment of adult female UTI for a 7-10 day period. Eighty-six adult women with clinical symptoms and urinary sediment signs suggestive of UTI were enrolled. In Group A, treatment was clinically assessed as effective in 95.3% and bacteriologically effective in 92.0% of the patients. In Group B, clinical and bacteriological efficacy was 100% and 95.5%, respectively. Differences between groups are not statistically significant. Adverse events were reported by 14.0% of patients in Group A and 9.6% in Group B (difference not statistically significant). There was one withdrawal due to dizziness. In this study, norfloxacin 800 mg once-a-day was as effective and safe as norfloxacin 400 mg twice-a-day in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.
TI  - Cytochalasin-induced actin disruption of polarized enterocytes can augment internalization of bacteria.
AB  - Cytochalasin-induced actin disruption has often been associated with decreased bacterial internalization by cultured epithelial cells, although polarized enterocytes have not been systematically studied. In assays using confluent polarized HT-29 enterocytes, cytochalasin D appeared to increase internalization of wild-type Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. HeLa and HEp-2 epithelial cells, as well as HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes, were used to clarify this unexpected observation. Resulting data showed that cytochalasin D was associated with increased internalization of S. typhimurium and P. mirabilis by both HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes and with increased internalization of E. coli by HT-29 enterocytes; with either HeLa or HEp-2 cells, cytochalasin was associated with no change or a decrease in internalization of these same bacterial strains. Cytochalasin caused decreased internalization of Listeria monocytogenes by HT-29, Caco-2, HeLa, and HEp-2 cells, indicating that cytochalasin did not consistently augment bacterial internalization by polarized enterocytes. Fluorescein-labeled phalloidin confirmed marked disruption of filamentous actin in cytochalasin-treated HT-29, Caco-2, HeLa, and HEp-2 cells. Cytochalasin had no noticeable effect on epithelial viability but caused distorted apical microvilli, cell rounding, and separation of adjacent enterocytes in confluent cultures (with a corresponding decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance). Scanning electron microscopy showed that cytochalasin-induced enhanced bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface. Colchicine, used to disrupt microtubules, had no noticeable effect on bacterial internalization by HT-29 or Caco-2 enterocytes. These data indicated that for HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes, cytochalasin-induced disruption of filamentous actin might augment internalization of some bacterial species by a mechanism that appeared to involve exposure of the enterocyte lateral surface.
TI  - An in-vitro study of carbapenem-induced morphological changes and endotoxin release in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - One hundred clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, were exposed to carbapenems (imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem) at 0.5 x MIC for 3 h, then their morphology was examined and endotoxin release determined. Ceftazidime, which induces filament formation, was used as a control. Scanning electron microscopy showed that these carbapenems induced formation of spherical or ovoid cells, except for P. aeruginosa treated with meropenem and biapenem; these latter cells had a 'bulge' midway along them and we have termed them 'oval-centred'. There was a relationship between morphology and the amount of endotoxin released following exposure to carbapenems or ceftazidime. Of all the species investigated, P. aeruginosa showed the most variable morphological changes. P. aeruginosa exposed to biapenem were longer oval-centred in shape, and released significantly more endotoxin than those exposed to imipenem, panipenem (spherical) or meropenem (shorter oval-centred cells) (P=0.030, 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). In all strains except P. aeruginosa, carbapenems induced significantly less endotoxin release than ceftazidime (P < 0.05).
TI  - Evaluation of use of a new chromogenic agar in detection of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - CHROMagar Orientation, a new chromogenic medium, was evaluated for the detection  and differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms in 900 urine samples from hospitalized patients. Performance characteristics of the medium were evaluated in comparison to those of 5% sheep blood and MacConkey agars by direct inoculation of the urine samples on the three media. Four gram-negative and two gram-positive strains as well as one yeast control strain from the American Type Culture Collection were used to ensure quality control. CHROMagar Orientation succeeded in detecting all the urine pathogens that were detected by the reference media, including gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, streptococci, and yeasts. Colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation accurately differentiated Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. Owing to the similarity in the pigmentation produced by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter isolates, the medium failed to distinguish among them; however, these isolates were easily recognized as coliforms because of their metallic blue coloration. Staphylococci were clearly perceptible: S. aureus and S. epidermidis grow in regular-size colonies that range from opaque white to yellowish, and S. saprophyticus produces opaque pink colonies. All streptococcus strains, including those from groups B and C, were detected. They grow as undifferentiated flat dry diffused colonies, and additional tests were required for identification. Enterococci were easily discriminated by their strong turquoise pigmentation and their typical growth on the agar's surface. Yeast grow in typical creamy wet convex colonies. The accuracy of antibiotic susceptibility determinations according to standard methods was also tested by picking isolates directly from CHROMagar Orientation. The results showed excellent correlation with those obtained with microorganisms picked from reference media. Owing to the ease in differentiating mixed flora on CHROMagar Orientation, antimicrobic susceptibility tests were performed directly from primary isolates in all cases without the need for subcultures.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded ampC-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis (CF09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated MIC of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. Two beta-lactamases with apparent pIs of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. Substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase with a pI of 9.0. Amplification by PCR with primers for ampC genes (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii) of a 756-bp DNA fragment from strain CF09 was obtained only with C. freundii-specific primers. Hybridization results showed that the ampC gene is only chromosomally located while the TEM gene is plasmid located. After cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that this ampC gene is close to blaCMY-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions Glu --> Gly at position 22, Trp --> Arg at position 201, and Ser --> Asn at position 343. AmpC beta-lactamases derived from that of C. freundii (LAT-1, LAT-2, BIL-1, and CMY-2) have been found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. This is the first example of a chromosomally encoded AmpC-type beta-lactamase observed in P. mirabilis. We suggest that it be designated CMY-3.
TI  - Translocated intestinal bacteria cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats: molecular epidemiologic evidence.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intestinal bacterial translocation is common in cirrhotic rats with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is thought to play a major pathogenic role. There has so far been no evidence for clonality between bacteria isolated from intestine and ascites. This study aimed to use molecular epidemiology techniques to show that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is due to translocated intestinal bacteria. METHODS: Samples of ascitic fluid, portal blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal contents from healthy (n=10) and ascitic cirrhotic rats with (n=12) or without (n=15) spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were cultured. In six infected rats, DNA macrorestriction fragments of 30 bacterial isolates [Escherichia coli (n=13), Enterococcus faecalis (n=12) and Proteus mirabilis (n=5)] from ascites (n=8), mesenteric lymph nodes (n=7), portal blood (n=6), and ileal flora (n=9) were compared. RESULTS: Bacterial translocation was more frequent in animals with (58%) than in those without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (20%, p=0.049) or controls (10%, p=0.026). The same bacterial strain was simultaneously isolated in ascites and in mesenteric lymph nodes and/or ileum in 7/8 (87%) instances. The identity rate for bacteria present in both ascites and mesenteric lymph nodes was 80% (4/5). Likewise, identity was demonstrated in 3/4 instances of bacteria found in both ascites and portal blood. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats is mainly due to intestinal bacteria translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes. Portal blood could be a less frequent route.
TI  - Regulatory conservation and divergence of sigma32 homologs from gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  - The heat shock response in Escherichia coli is mediated primarily by the rpoH gene, encoding sigma32, which is specifically required for transcription of heat shock genes. A number of sigma32 homologs have recently been cloned from gram-negative bacteria that belong to the gamma or alpha subdivisions of the proteobacteria. We report here some of the regulatory features of several such homologs (RpoH) expressed in E. coli as well as in respective cognate bacteria. When expressed in an E. coli delta rpoH strain lacking its own sigma32, these homologs activated the transcription of heat shock genes (groE and dnaK) from the start sites normally used in E. coli. The level of RpoH in Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was very low at 30 degrees C but was elevated markedly upon a shift to 42 degrees C, as found previously with E. coli. The increased RpoH levels upon heat shock resulted from both increased synthesis and stabilization of the normally unstable RpoH protein. In contrast, the RpoH level in Proteus mirabilis was relatively high at 30 degrees C and increased less markedly upon heat shock, mostly by increased synthesis; this sigma32 homolog was already stable at 30 degrees C, and little further stabilization occurred upon the shift to 42 degrees C. The increased synthesis of RpoH homologs in all these gamma proteobacteria was observed even in the presence of rifampin, suggesting that the induction occurred at the level of translation. Thus, the basic regulatory strategy of the heat shock response by enhancing the RpoH level is well conserved in the gamma proteobacteria, but some divergence in the actual mechanisms used occurred during evolution.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - The periplasmic, group III catalase of Vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  - The catalase gene, katA, of the sepiolid squid symbiont Vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of KatA has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group III catalases, including those found in Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus mirabilis. Upstream of the predicted start codon of katA is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in Escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpoS. Further, the level of expression of the cloned katA gene in an E. coli rpoS mutant is much lower than in wild-type E. coli. Catalase activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing V. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. The catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type V. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. No significant catalase activity could be detected in a katA null mutant strain, demonstrating that KatA is the predominately expressed catalase in V. fischeri and indicating that V. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. The catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between V. fischeri and its squid host.
TI  - [Virulence factors and host responses in urinary tract infections].
AB  - Pathogenicity of urinary tract infection (UTI) has been reviewed mainly focussing on the bacterial adherence in uropathogens and the inflammatory responses of urinary mucosa. Bacterial fimbriae or pili, which are encoded by chromosomal gene clusters played a major role in the adherence mechanisms of uropathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli. Furthermore, inflammatory responses in urinary mucosa including cytokine release was also investigated. The latest information concerning pathogenicity of UTI is described and discussed here.
TI  - Enterobacterial antibodies in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microbial infection in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Sera from 39 Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 52 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 51 healthy subjects (HS) were examined for IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (capsular serotypes 31 and 43), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In patients with RA, IgA class antibodies against all bacterial strains used as the antigen were increased when compared to healthy controls. In patients with AS, significantly elevated IgA levels were observed against Campylobacter and Klebsiella K43. IgM class antibodies were less frequently elevated in RA and in AS than IgA class antibodies. In RA patients, IgG antibodies against Klebsiella K43 and Proteus were significantly increased. No differences were observed in IgG class antibodies between AS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increases in serum bacterial antibodies in RA and AS suggest that in both diseases stimulation of the intestinal immune system by enterobacteria may have a role. However, the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased intestinal permeability and/or represents cross reactions between different enterobacteria remains open.
TI  - Molecular mechanisms of polymyxin B-membrane interactions: direct correlation between surface charge density and self-promoted transport.
AB  - We have studied the interaction of the polycationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin  B (PMB) with asymmetric planar bilayer membranes via electrical measurements. The bilayers were of different compositions, including those of the lipid matrices of the outer membranes of various species of Gram-negative bacteria. One leaflet, representing the bacterial inner leaflet, consisted of a phospholipid mixture (PL; phosphatidylethanolamine, -glycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol in a molar ratio of 81:17:2). The other (outer) leaflet consisted either of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from deep rough mutants of PMB-sensitive (Escherichia coli F515) or -resistant strains (Proteus mirabilis R45), glycosphingolipid (GSL-1) from Sphingomonas paucimobilis IAM 12576, or phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine). In all membrane systems, the addition of PMB to the outer leaflet led to the induction of current fluctuations due to transient membrane lesions. The minimal PMB concentration required for the induction of the lesions and their size correlated with the charge of the lipid molecules. In the membrane system resembling the lipid matrix of a PMB-sensitive strain (F515 LPS/PL), the diameters of the lesions were large enough (d = 2.4 nm +/- 8%) to allow PMB molecules to permeate (self-promoted transport), but in all other systems they were too small. A comparison of these phenomena with membrane effects induced by detergents (dodecyltriphenylphosphonium bromide, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodiumdodecylsulfate) revealed a detergent-like mechanism of the PMB-membrane interaction.
TI  - Two nosocomial strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia transferring antibiotic resistance to Proteus mirabilis P-38 recipient strain.
AB  - In this report we describe a specific transfer of carbenicillin and cephaloridine resistance determinants from two different strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: No. 215 and 221 isolated from two critically ill patients treated in different Intensive Care Units of a large University Hospital in Ostrava, Czech Republic. These strains were resistant to flouroquinolones and the following beta-lactam drugs: carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem and aztreonam. Both strains transferred carbenicillin and cephaloridine resistance determinants, with rather different frequency, to Proteus mirabilis P-38. All carbenicillin-selected transconjugants were found by an indirect selection method to be co-resistant to cephaloridine only. In a second cycle of transfers Proteus mirabilis R+ strains directly transferred carbenicillin and cephalothin determinants to Escherichia coli K-12 No. 185 nal+ lac+ recipient strain.
TI  - Microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%), anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). Multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); Bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group B (4); and Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group D, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis (3 each). All patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. Six (55%) of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Chromogenic detection of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases.
AB  - A coupled chromogenic reaction (based on an agar overlay combining NADH, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, and kanamycin sulfate with thiazolyl blue-phenazine methosulfate for detection of NADH consumption) was optimized for the detection of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs). When used after analytical isoelectrofocusing of bacterial extracts from APH-producing strains, this method revealed one band in each of two strains with a genetically confirmed APH (3') I and two bands in another strain with both APH (3') I and APH (3') VI, whereas no bands were detected in susceptible control strains or in aminoglycoside-resistant microorganisms without APH genes.
TI  - Reduction of carriage of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle by  inoculation with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria inhibitory to Escherichia coli O157:H7 were isolated from cattle and evaluated for their potential for reducing carriage of E. coli O157:H7 in calves. Eighteen of 1,200 bacterial isolates from cattle feces and intestinal tissue samples were screened and determined to inhibit the growth of E. coli O157:H7 in vitro. Seventeen of the isolates were E. coli and one was Proteus mirabilis. None produced Shiga toxin. Genomic DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 13 distinguishable profiles among the 18 isolates. Two calves inoculated perorally with a mixture of all 18 isolates (10(10) CFU) appeared to be normal and did not develop signs of clinical disease throughout a 25- to 27-day observation period. These bacteria colonized segments of the gastrointestinal tract and were in feces at the termination of the experiment (25 and 27 days postinoculation) at levels of 50 to 200 CFU/g. Fifteen cannulated calves were studied to determine the efficiency of the probiotic bacteria in reducing or eliminating the carriage of E. coli O157:H7. Nine calves served as controls, with each animal receiving perorally 10(10) CFU of E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was detected intermittently in the rumen samples from all control animals throughout 3 weeks postinoculation, whereas E. coli O157:H7 was shed at various levels in feces continuously throughout the experiment (mean, 28 days). E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from the rumens and colons of eight of nine and nine of nine calves, respectively, at the termination of the study. Six calves each received perorally 10(10) CFU of probiotic bacteria and then 2 days later received 10(10) CFU of E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in the rumen for only 9 days postinoculation in two animals, for 16 days in one animal, for 17 days in two animals, and for 29 days in one animal. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in feces for only 11 days postinoculation in one animal, for 15 days in one animal, for 17 days in one animal, for 18 days in one animal, for 19 days in one animal, and for 29 days in one animal. At the end of the experiment (mean, 30 days), E. coli O157:H7 was not recovered from the rumen of any of the six animals treated with probiotic bacteria; however, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered from the feces of one of the animals. This animal was fasted twice postinoculation. These studies indicate that selected probiotic bacteria administered to cattle prior to exposure to E. coli O157:H7 can reduce the level of carriage of E. coli O157:H7 in most animals.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the elderly.
AB  - The aims of the study were to describe community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia in elderly patients and to determine the factors associated with increased mortality in these patients attending a tertiary hospital in Singapore. A consecutive series of 191 patients aged more than 60 years of age admitted in 1995 was studied retrospectively. All of them had positive blood culture results obtained from the Department of Pathology and the case notes were reviewed and entered into a standard clinical protocol. They were analysed for age, sex, place of origin, race, sites of infection, clinical parameters and bacteriology. The mean age of the study population was 75 years (SD = 8.9 years). Bacteraemia was acquired from the community in 57.5% of patients, 33% was nosocomial in origin and 9.5% acquired it in chronic long term care facilities. The common organisms cultured in community-acquired infections were Escherichia coli (26.1%), Klebsiella species (25.4%), Streptococcus species (11.1%), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.6%) and Proteus mirabilis (4.8%). The common organisms cultured in nosocomial infections were Klebsiella species (19.8%), Enterobacter species (14.6%), E. coli (11.8%), Acinetobacter baumanii (9.2%), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). Whilst most cases of bacteraemia were single organism cultures, 13.5% were polymicrobial. The common sources of bacteraemia were chest (27.5%), urinary tract (24.5%), skin (12.5), hepatic (8.8%), gut (4.3%), cardiovascular system (1%) and others (3.6%). In 12.5% of cases, the sources were multiple and in 5.3% of cases, the source could not be identified. Twenty-one per cent of patients with bacteraemia died. The following factors were associated with increased mortality rate: older age (median age of those that died was 78.5 years compared to survivors with a median age of 73 years, P = 0.011), patient's place of origin (patients in nursing home at higher risk of death, P = 0.04), patient's mobility status (immobile patients at higher risk, P = 0.00297), source of bacteraemia--respiratory infection at increased risk of death (P = 0.00009) but urinary tract infection had a better survival rate (P = 0.03935) and multiple sites of infection (patients with multiple sites of infection had higher risk, P = 0.00897). Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was associated with a mortality rate of 35.3%, followed by Klebsiella species 28.6%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 28.6%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 25%, Proteus mirabilis 25% and E. coli 19.1%. Important clinical parameters which indicated a poor clinical outcome were: high pulse rate, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, low total white cell count, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia and increased creatinine level.
TI  - In vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a Spanish multicenter study.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. More than 90.0% of the Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. In general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (UTIs) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated UTIs. More than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from UTIs, except for P. aeruginosa (31.8%) and Acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. The results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated UTIs.
TI  - Transmucosal passage of bacteria across rat intestinal epithelium in the Ussing chamber: effect of nutritional factors and bacterial virulence.
AB  - Transmucosal passage of bacteria across the intestine, the essential and prerequisite step for bacterial translocation, cannot be effectively studied using in vivo models of translocation. We have adapted the Ussing chamber into a fresh, sterile organ culture system that can facilitate the study of bacterial-epithelial interactions. Intestinal membranes were mounted in the Ussing chamber and perfused with a solution rich in putative mucosal micronutrients. The transmembrane potential difference was constantly monitored as a marker of intestinal integrity. Transmucosal passage of various bacteria across the normal intestinal epithelium was quantitated, and the mucosal membrane was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. The addition of potassium cyanide to the mucosal perfusate resulted in an irreversible loss of potential difference. Oxygen deprivation also led to a precipitous drop in potential difference, but it was reversible with prompt reoxygenation. In contrast, intestinal membranes perfused with a solution consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20 mM glutamine maintained their potential difference for a sustained period (>180 min). Both the viability and structural integrity of the ileal intestinal membrane were maintained in culture ex vivo using this perfusate. Qualitative differences were observed in the mechanism of transmucosal passage of mild to moderately virulent bacteria such as Escherichia coli C-25 and Proteus mirabilis M-13, which pass through the intestinal epithelium without causing overt damage to the mucosa, and more virulent organisms such as Salmonella typhimurium, which cause extensive mucosal damage by light and transmission electron microscopy. The Ussing system should provide a useful model of intact organ culture for the study of the mechanisms of bacterial translocation and the pathogenesis of enteric infections.
TI  - Expression and secretion of functional miniantibodies McPC603scFvDhlx in cell-wall-less L-form strains of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli: a comparison of the synthesis capacities of L-form strains with an E. coli producer strain.
AB  - The paper describes the synthesis of the phosphorylcholine-binding miniantibody McPC603scFvDhl x in cell-wall-less L-form strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Cells of these strains were transformed with the plasmid pACK02scKan, carrying the miniantibody (miniAb) coding sequence under the control of the lac promoter. L-form transformants of both species were able to synthesize the functional miniAb as an extracellular soluble product. The highest quantities were obtained by P. mirabilis L-form strains after induction with 5 mM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Yields of 45-75 mg/l total antibody protein and of 10-18 mg/l functional miniAb were estimated in the growth medium of shaking cultures 40-80 h after induction with IPTG. About 10% of the active miniAb remained cell-bound. The yields of functional miniAb could be optimized by lowering the growth temperature from 37 degrees C to 26-32 degrees C and by supplementation of the medium with 80 mM sodium fumarate. A comparison of the specific activities revealed that the P. mirabilis L-form strains have a similar synthesis capacity (2-4 mg functional miniAb/g cell dry weight) to that of the producer strain E. coli RV308. The results show that the processes of correct folding and assembling of the miniAb molecules are possible without the periplasmic compartment.
TI  - Changing trends in frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens in outpatient clinics and a hospital in Southern Israel, 1991-1995.
AB  - In order to monitor changes in the frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens over several years, urinary cultures received from outpatient clinics and from a hospital during a period of one month each in 1991 and 1995 were analyzed at a clinical microbiology laboratory. In 1991 and 1995, 1366 and 1534 significant monomicrobic cultures respectively were reviewed. The frequency of Escherichia coli dropped significantly in the outpatient clinics from 70.5% to 61.2% (p < 0.0001). The frequency of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria also decreased, but the frequency of Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. increased from 2.6% to 5.8% (p < 0.0001). In the hospital, the frequency of Enterobacter spp. (p < 0.04), Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas the frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), Acinetobacter spp. (p < 0.05), Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative rods increased considerably. The frequency of gram-positive aerobic bacteria rose markedly in outpatient specimens from 6.1% to 13.5% (p < 0.0001), while a decline from 14.4% to 9.3% was noted in hospital specimens (p < 0.02). A significant rise in the resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) was detected in outpatient isolates. In the hospital, gram-negative urinary pathogens demonstrated increased resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.042), cefuroxime (p = 0.005), gentamicin (p = 0.002) and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) during the study period. The changing etiology of urinary tract infections and the increasing resistance of organisms indicate that periodic monitoring and possibly also modification of empirical therapy are required.
TI  - Isolation, purification, and characterization of the major autolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The major (26 kDa) autolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative electrophoresis, ion-exchange, and dye-ligand chromatographies. This purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing peptidoglycan. The pl of the 26-kDa autolysin was determined to be between 3.5 and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for activity. The autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli indicating it to be a beta-glycosidase. It was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria and the O-acetylated peptidoglycans from either Proteus mirabilis or Staphylococcus aureus. The N-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be His-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gly. The 26-kDa autolysin together with a 29-kDa autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal growth, but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth supernatants.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - Use of green fluorescent protein to assess urease gene expression by uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis during experimental ascending urinary tract infection.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a cause of complicated urinary tract infection, expresses urease when exposed to urea. While it is recognized that the positive transcriptional activator UreR induces gene expression, the levels of expression of the enzyme during experimental infection are not known. To investigate in vivo expression of P. mirabilis urease, the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to construct reporter fusions. Translational fusions of urease accessory gene ureD, which is preceded by a urea-inducible promoter, were made with gfp (modified to express S65T/V68L/S72A [B. P. Cormack et al. Gene 173:33-38, 1996]). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing of the fusion junctions. UreD-GFP fusion protein was induced by urea in both Escherichia coli DH5alpha and P. mirabilis HI4320. By using Western blotting with antiserum raised against GFP, expression level was shown to correlate with urea concentration (tested from 0 to 500 mM), with highest induction at 200 to 500 mM urea. Fluorescent E. coli and P. mirabilis bacteria were observed by fluorescence microscopy following urea induction, and the fluorescence intensity of GFP in cell lysates was measured by spectrophotofluorimetry. P. mirabilis HI4320 carrying the UreD-GFP fusion plasmid was transurethrally inoculated into the bladders of CBA mice. One week postchallenge, fluorescent bacteria were detected in thin sections of both bladder and kidney samples; the fluorescence intensity of bacteria in bladder tissue was higher than that in the kidney. Kidneys were primarily infected with single-cell-form fluorescent bacteria, while aggregated bacterial clusters were observed in the bladder. Elongated swarmer cells were only rarely observed. These observations demonstrate that urease is expressed in vivo and that using GFP as a reporter protein is a viable approach to investigate in vivo expression of P. mirabilis virulence genes in experimental urinary tract infection.
TI  - IgM, IgG and IgA class enterobacterial antibodies in serum and synovial fluid in  patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - IgM, IgG and IgA class antibodies against three Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular types, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, as well as total immunoglobulin concentrations, were measured by enzyme immunoassay and radial immunodiffusion technique, respectively, in paired serum and synovial fluid samples from eight patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 10 with rheumatoid arthritis. No clear evidence for intra-articular antibody production against any of the studied microbes was found.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in nosocomial Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain.
AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (298/85) was isolated from the extensively inflamed  conjunctiva of a neonate in a regional hospital in Ostrava, Czech Republic. It was resistant to all available antibiotics except cefepime and trimethoprim. The donor S. maltophilia strain 298/85 transferred carbenicillin and cephaloridine resistance determinants to recipient strains of Escherichia coli K-12 3110 rif+ and Proteus mirabilis P-38 rif+. All transconjugant colonies were co-resistant also to kanamycin, cefotaxime, and aztreonam. Active hydrolysis of imipenem in the original strain was inhibited by ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid, and hydrolysis of cefotaxime and aztreonam in the original strain and in the E. coli K-12 transconjugant was inhibited by clavulanate. In contrast, ceftazidime was hydrolyzed by the original strain and was not inhibited by clavulanate, indicating a different character of the resistance to cefotaxime or aztreonam and ceftazidime.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from six Norwegian hospitals 1991-1992.
AB  - From August 1991 to February 1992, each of the six largest hospitals throughout Norway collected 84 to 107 consecutive blood culture isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, altogether 571 isolates. The distribution of various species and genera at the different hospitals was uniform; Escherichia coli being most prevalent (57-67%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (12-18%) and Proteus mirabilis (7-11%). Twenty-one and 4% of E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and cefuroxime, respectively, and 11% of Klebsiella isolates were cefuroxime resistant. Five Enterobacter isolates and one Citrobacter isolate were resistant to ceftazidime, and one Salmonella isolate was resistant to imipenem. All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin. These results were compared with the antibiotic consumption in each hospital region. Although hospitals in the regions with the highest consumption of ampicillin tended to have a higher percentage of isolates resistant to this agent, no significant differences were found. There was no significant difference between hospitals regarding prevalence of cefuroxime-resistant isolates.
TI  - Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated as H9 (IgG2a) and H20 (IgM), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) of Helicobacter pylori strain TK1029 were established. Affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots with MAb H9 and MAb H20 respectively. These antigens also reacted with the 3C8 MAb previously established in this laboratory, which recognised Yersinia enterocolitica HSP60. By amino-acid sequence analysis, the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the protein recognised by both H9 and H20 MAbs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of H. pylori HSP60 reported previously. Both MAbs reacted with nine strains of H. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis. In addition, MAb H9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria including H. mustelae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei. In contrast, MAb H20 reacted only with strains H. pylori. These results suggest that both the species-specific epitope recognised by MAb H20 and the common epitope recognised by MAb H9 exist on HSP60 of the bacterial cell. Both MAbs also reacted with the 60-kDa protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (MKN45) cells. It was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with MAb H20. These results suggest that there is a common epitope in H. pylori HSP60 and human gastric epithelial cells.
TI  - An infection inhibiting urinary catheter material.
AB  - Catheter associated bacteriuria is a common infection in hospitals and nursing homes. An infection inhibiting catheter material for fabricating urinary catheters is being developed. The material consists of silicone rubber elastomer compounded with chlorhexidene gluconate (CHG) matrix. The antibiotic is released in sustained fashion over at least 4 weeks. A method was established for adding CHG to silicone rubber. To protect the CHG, it is suspended in a water soluble wax that also modulates CHG release from the elastomer. It was found that CHG is randomly dispersed in the elastomer and that the primary release mechanism is by diffusion. The antibacterial activity of the material with a range of 0.1 to 5% CHG by weight was examined using in vitro zone inhibition testing. The new material demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against three pathogens tested (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.). The release rate of CHG was measured in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With 5% CHG loading, the antibiotic was released at a steady rate of approximately 8.4 mg/cm2/day for periods extending beyond 4 weeks. This new material for urinary catheters has the potential to provide protection against infection and surface colonization.
TI  - Novel selective and non-selective optical detection of microorganisms.
AB  - A new instrument, capable of detecting metabolic changes due to microbiological activity, is described. Optical changes in growth media are monitored in a semi-fluid zone that separates the liquid medium containing the sample. Data demonstrate that common media can be utilized in conjunction with this rapid automated technology. Nutrient broth with the pH dye indicator. bromocresol purple was suitable for total counts. Selective media containing dyes were utilized to assess the presence or absence of specific groups of organisms. Biochemical reactions, such as lysine decarboxylase activity, were identified by the unique generated patterns, and specific enzymatic cleavage reactions with chromogenic substrates, such as 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid (X-GLUC), were monitored.
TI  - Concentrations of prophylactic ceftriaxone in abdominal tissues during pancreatic surgery.
AB  - Ceftriaxone concentrations in abdominal tissues were evaluated after administration as antibiotic prophylaxis for pancreatic surgery. Ten patients were given ceftriaxone (1 g i.v.) 30 min before surgery. Ceftriaxone concentrations in fatty tissues ranged from 2.5 to 6.2 microg/g. Ceftriaxone concentrations were 6.0 +/- 8.6 microg/g in pancreatic tissues, 2.1 +/- 2.5 mg/L in pancreatic fluid, 1179 +/- 1271 mg/L in pancreatic bile, and 18 +/- 16 microg/g in the liver. In fatty tissues, 8-10 patients had tissue levels greater than the MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and the 10 patients had tissue levels greater than the MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. In other tissues, penetration was greater than the MIC90 for potential pathogens in 50-100% of the patients.
TI  - Negative feedback from a Proteus class II flagellum export defect to the flhDC master operon controlling cell division and flagellum assembly.
AB  - The Proteus mirabilis flagellum class I flhDC operon was isolated, and its transcript was shown to originate from a sigma70 promoter 244 bp 5' of flhD and 29 bp 3' of a putative cyclic AMP receptor protein-binding site. Expression of this regulatory master operon increased strongly as cells differentiated into elongated hyperflagellated swarm filaments, and cell populations artificially overexpressing flhDC migrated sooner and faster. A class II flhA transposon mutant was reduced in flagellum class III gene expression, as would be expected from the FlgM anti-sigma28 accumulation demonstrated in Salmonella typhimurium, but was unexpectedly also reduced in cell elongation. Here, we show that levels of flhDC transcript were ca. 10-fold lower in this flagellum export mutant, indicating that in cells defective in flagellum assembly, there is additional negative feedback via flhDC. In support of this view, artificial overexpression of flhDC in the flhA mutant restored elongation but not class III flagellum gene transcription.
TI  - An Edwardsiella tarda strain containing a mutation in a gene with homology to shlB and hpmB is defective for entry into epithelial cells in culture.
AB  - Edwardsiella tarda is an enteric pathogen that causes diarrhea, wound infections, and death due to septicemia. This species is capable of invading human epithelial cell lines, and we have now been able to follow the entry and replication of E. tarda within tissue culture host cells. E. tarda escapes from the endocytic vacuole within minutes of entry and then replicates within the cytoplasm. Unlike other well-studied bacteria that replicate and reside in the cytoplasm, we never observed this organism moving directly from cell to cell; instead the bacteria spread by lysing the plasma membrane after several rounds of replication. Efforts to study the interactions of E. tarda with tissue culture cells are complicated by the presence of a potent cytotoxin that the bacterium produces. Using transposon mutagenesis, we isolated a noncytotoxic strain of E. tarda. This mutant is also defective for hemolysin production. The dual phenotype of this strain is consistent with the hypothesis that cytotoxicity is due to the previously characterized E. tarda hemolysin activity. The nonhemolytic strain is also unable to enter HEp-2 cells. The disrupted gene has sequence similarity to members of a family of genes required for transport and activation of the hemolysin genes, shlA and hpmA. A cosmid bearing 40 kb of E. tarda DNA, including wild-type copies of the E. tarda homologs of the transporter-activator protein and the hemolysin itself, confers hemolytic, cytotoxic, and invasive abilities upon normally nonhemolytic, noncytotoxic, and noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli. Sequence data indicate that the genes required for hemolytic activity are linked to a transposable element, suggesting that they arose in the E. tarda genome by horizontal transfer.
TI  - Mechanisms of action of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein BPI on reconstituted outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mechanisms of interaction of the recombinant N-terminal portion of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, rBPI21, with various planar asymmetric and symmetric bilayer membranes, including the lipid matrix of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, were investigated via electrical measurements. For the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leaflet of the outer membrane, isolated deep rough mutant LPS of Escherichia coli strain F515 (F515 LPS) and Proteus mirabilis strain R45 (R45 LPS) were used. The addition of rBPI21 to the LPS side of asymmetric LPS/phospholipid membranes, as well as to black lipid membranes made from dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), led to membrane rupture. The innermembrane potential difference resulted in a slight increase from 0 to 5 mV for symmetric DOPG membranes but changed for asymmetric F515 LPS/PL membranes from -36 to +8 mV and for R45 LPS/PL membranes from -37 to -5 mV following the addition of rBPI21. In all cases, the addition of rBPI21 led to an increase in membrane current. The effect of rBPI21 on the innermembrane potential difference of LPS/PL membranes was significantly reduced in the presence of 40 mM MgCl2 (shift from -36 to -31 mV for F515 LPS). On the basis of these results and from our studies on the interaction of rBPI21 with lipid monolayers and aggregates [Wiese, A., et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 10301-10310], a model is discussed explaining how the observed membrane rupture, increase of membrane current, and change of transmembrane potential as induced by rBPI21 may contribute to bacterial dysfunction.
TI  - Carbenicillin-hydrolysing penicillinase mediated by a plasmid of Proteus mirabilis and its relationship to the PSE-type enzymes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a carbenicillin-hydrolysing (carbenicillinase) gene occurring in an endogenous plasmid, pCS229, of Proteus mirabilis was determined. The amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme, comprising 271 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29,506 Da, was deduced. The pCS229 carbenicillinase showed only 46.4% similarity, in the overall amino acid sequence, to the chromosomal carbenicillinase of Pr. mirabilis GN79; however, the enzyme showed about 98% similarity to a Pseudomonas-specific plasmid-encoded carbenicillinase, PSE-4, that was isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only five of 271 amino acids differed from those of PSE-4. This study proved the close relationship between the carbenicillinase genes distributed in Pr. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - A nonswarming mutant of Proteus mirabilis lacks the Lrp global transcriptional regulator.
AB  - Proteus swarming is the rapid cyclical population migration across surfaces by elongated cells that hyperexpress flagellar and virulence genes. The mini-Tn5 transposon mutant mns2 was isolated as a tight nonswarming mutant that did not elongate or upregulate flagellar and hemolysin genes. Individual cell motility was retained but was reduced. The transposon had inserted in the gene encoding the global transcriptional regulator Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), expression of which was upregulated in differentiating swarm cells. Swarming was restored to the lrp mutant by artificial overexpression of the flhDC flagellar regulatory master operon. Lrp may be a key component in generating or relaying signals that are required for flagellation and swarming, possibly acting through the flhDC operon.
TI  - The Escherichia coli K-12 sheA gene encodes a 34-kDa secreted haemolysin.
AB  - Haemolytic toxins belong to one of several classes of virulence factors that contribute to bacterial pathogenicity. The non-pathogenic Escherichia coli K-12 laboratory strain was considered for years to be non-haemolytic. However, overproduction of several transcriptional regulators induced the appearance of a haemolytic activity that is absent under usual laboratory growth conditions. In this work, we have cloned and characterized an E. coli K-12 gene, sheA, whose overexpression results in a haemolytic phenotype. It maps to min 27 on the genetic map, and codes for a 34-kDa polypeptide with at least one putative transmembrane segment. This polypeptide, which has neither signal peptide nor other known secretory motifs, is secreted to the medium during the exponential growth phase. In vitro coupled transcription/translation assays, using a plasmid carrying only the sheA gene as template, resulted in the production of a polypeptide with haemolytic activity per se. Our results demonstrate that the sheA gene actually encodes the E. coli K-12 chromosomal haemolysin. The SheA haemolysin does not resemble other known cytolytic toxins, and it may represent the prototype of a novel family, as suggested by the presence of homologues in several E. coli pathogenic strains and in Shigella flexneri.
TI  - Enhanced jejunal production of antibodies to Klebsiella and other Enterobacteria  in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure gut immunity directly in jejunal fluid in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Antibodies against three different Enterobacterias were measured in jejunal perfusion fluids (collected by a double balloon perfusion device) of 19 patients with AS, 14 patients with RA, and 22 healthy controls using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The AS patients had significantly increased jejunal fluid concentrations of IgM, IgG, and IgA class antibodies against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and IgM and IgA class antibodies against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis compared with healthy controls. When compared with the patients with RA, the AS patients had higher concentrations of IgA and IgG class antibodies only against K pneumoniae. The RA patients had higher IgM class antibody concentrations against all three studied Enterobacterias, when compared with the healthy controls, suggesting an enhanced mucosal immune response in these patients. A three month treatment with sulphasalazine did not decrease enterobacterial antibody concentrations in the 10 patients with AS. CONCLUSION: There is strong direct evidence for an abnormal mucosal humoral immune response particularly to K pneumoniae in patients with AS.
TI  - [The photometric determination of the antilysozyme activity of microorganisms].
AB  - The method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of Micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. The new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ALA of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ALA. The elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.
TI  - Inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases.
AB  
TI  - [Characterization of plasmids which mediate resistance to multiple antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria of nosocomial origin].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance of 10 strains of gramnegative bacilli (1 Serratia marcescens; 2 Escherichia coli; 1 Proteus mirabilis; 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae; 1 Enterobacter cloacae y 1 Alcaligenes faecalis), isolated from adult patients with nosocomial pulmonary infection at the in-patient facilities of the University Hospital of Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela, have been studied. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations using the dilution method in agar. The study of extrachromosomal genes was carried out by conjugation, bacterial infection with the bacteriophage M13 and curing of plasmid by acridine orange. The plasmids were isolated by alkaline lysis and analysis of restriction endonuclease digestion was carried out separately using the enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. A DNA probe, derived from the region which encodes the TEM-1 beta-lactamase of the plasmid pBR322 was used for dot-blot hybridization tests. RESULTS: All of the gramnegative bacilli showed resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin (> 128 micrograms/ml) and 3 strains also showed resistance to gentamicin (> 64 micrograms/ml). Genetic and molecular procedures showed the presence of conjugative plasmids of approximately 54 kb in all the 10 strains. The restriction patterns obtained by using EcoRI and HindIII indicated common DNA fragments in most of the plasmids studied. The dot-blot hybridization tests confirmed homology between the plasmids and the DNA probe used (TEM-1 beta-lactamase). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the gramnegative bacteria of nosocomial origin harbored self-transferable plasmids of approximately 54 kb, which mediate resistance to gentamicin and encode a beta-lactamase of the TEM group.
TI  - Some pathogenic fungi involved in serious cases of urinary tract infections in Nigeria.
AB  - Three hundred early morning midstream urine samples collected from 200 females and 100 males between the ages of 20 and 60 years, suffering from urinary tract infections (UTI) were studied to determine the etiologic agents. The caliberated loop-direct method used for culturing each sample on both bacterial and fungal media showed significant microbial growth in 117 of the 300 samples. Bacteria were the sole agents of infection in 30% of the cases while pathogenic yeasts were the sole agents of infection in 8% of the cases. Only 1% showed mixed infection. The bacterial pathogens identified from the culture were Escherichia coli (12.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.0%), Proteus mirabilis (4.3%), Klebsiella aerogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus faecalis (2.0%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.3%). The fungal pathogens isolated were Candida albicans (0.3%). While patients between the ages of 20 and 40 years were significantly more susceptible to UTI caused by bacteria (P = 0.05), patients between the ages of 41 and 60 years were more prone to UTI caused by fungi. Also females appeared to contact UTI more often than males.
TI  - Potentiating effect of EDTA-Tris on the activity of antibiotics against resistant bacteria associated with otitis, dermatitis and cystitis.
AB  - Possible synergistic effects of the combination of EDTA-tromethamine (EDTA-Tris)  and three antimicrobial agents (cephaloridine, kanendomycin and enrofloxacin) against resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are reported. Bacteria were isolated from eight cases of chronic otitis externa, five cases of chronic dermatitis and four cases of recurrent cystitis in dogs which had previously been treated with one of the three antibiotics without success. Animals exposed to EDTA-tromethamine plus the antibiotic recovered completely within 10 days, and were controlled clinically and bacteriologically for 180 days. Local irrigation with EDTA-tromethamine solution was well tolerated and no side effects were recorded.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - [Study of in vitro activity of 3 cephalosporins and their combination with 2 beta-lactamase inhibitors against 4 enterobacteria strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefotaxime, cefepime and cefpirome was evaluated alone and in association with two beta-lactamase inhibitors: clavulanic acid and sulbactam against 65 extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae strains [Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Proteus mirabilis (9), Escherichia coli (11), Enterobacter aerogenes (10)]. The lowest MICs were observed for cefepime and cefpirome used alone. In association with inhibitors cefotaxime was less effective against E. aerogenes. Most isolates of K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli were susceptible to all the different tested associations.
TI  - Iron-regulated haemolysin gene from Edwardsiella tarda.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the haemolysin gene locus from Edwardsiella tarda (ETH). This region encoded two open reading frames, designated ethA and ethB. ethA is the haemolysin gene consisting of 4782bp encoding a product of 165.3 kDa and ethB is an activation/secretion protein gene of 1677bp that encodes a product of 61.9 kDa. There were two putative ferric uptake regulator (Fur) binding sites on the 5' upstream region of the ethB gene overlapping the promoter region and ribosome-binding site. The haemolysin produced by the cloned gene was secreted by Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of the ethA and ethB genes were found to be homologous to those of the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens. E. coli carrying the ethA gene but not the ethB gene completely lost haemolytic activity, although the ethA gene was transcribed. The protein expressed by E. coli carrying a recombinant plasmid which encoded the ethA gene had haemagglutination activity. The EthB protein was necessary for activation of EthA protein (haemolysin). The ethA and ethB genes were very prevalent in haemolytic E. tarda strains isolated from diseased fish. Transcription of the ethB gene was regulated by iron. The ethA and ethB genes were transcribed independently.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at Sao Paulo Hospital--UNIFESP/EPM in June and July of 1992. The species distribution was as follows: Enterobacter sp. (62), Escherichia coli (308), Klebsiella pneumoniae (27), Klebsiella sp. (9), Proteus mirabilis (23), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), Pseudomonas sp. (4), Serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives (7). Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. The antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, DU 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, FK 037, imipenem, meropenem and biapenem. RESULTS: DU 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. It was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. The potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae, except for Enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than they were to cefetazidime or FK 037. When testing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active than imipenem or biapenem. In addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. CONCLUSION: The new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. However, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.
TI  - Tazobactam-piperacillin compared with sulbactam-ampicillin, clavulanic acid-ticarcillin, sulbactam-cefoperazone, and piperacillin for activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria isolated from patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tazobactam-piperacillin was compared with that of sulbactam-ampicillin, clavulanic acid-ticarcillin, sulbactam-cefoperazone and piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria isolated from patients with complicated urinary tract infections. Tazobactam-piperacillin showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) of tazobactam-piperacillin were 6.25 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Proteus mirabilis, 3.13 micrograms/ml against Proteus vulgaris, 6.25 micrograms/ml against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and 6.25 micrograms/ml coagulase-negative methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. Against all beta-lactamase-producing bacteria tested the antibacterial activity of tazobactam-piperacillin was at least 4- to 64-fold stronger than that of piperacillin, clavulanic acid-ticarcillin, and sulbactam-ampicillin, and similar to or greater than that of sulbactam-cefoperazone except for E. coli.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Antimicrobial potentiality of a new beta-lactum antibiotic fosfomycin.
AB  - Antimicrobial action of penicillin and some of its derivatives including fosfomycin was studied with respect to 225 strains of Gram-positive and Gram negative bacteria. Fosfomycin was found to possess somewhat less activity against Staphylococcus aureus compared with other penicillins; however, it showed powerful activity towards Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - The effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on bacterial translocation in the splenectomized rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We created a study group in order to investigate the effects of  splenectomy and filgrastim. Filgrastim is an immunomodulator granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), that affects bacterial translocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created 3 study groups with 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats; the first group included sham splenectomy, the second group was splenectomy, and the third group was splenectomy+ filgrastim group. RESULTS: The mean bacterial colony count of the cecum were 2.5 x 10(9) in group 1, 1.2 x 10(10) in group 2 and 3.5 x 10(9) in group 3. The differences between these groups were accepted as statistically significant. The mean counts of the terminal ileum were 1.1 x 10(9) in group 1, 5.5 x 10(10) in group 2 and 2.5 x 10(10) in group 3. The p values of group 1-2 were 0.036 (statistically significant) and 0.123 in groups 2-3) were not statistically significant. The mean counts of the liver were 0.2 x 10(4), 1 x 10(10) and 3.4 x 10(5), respectively. In comparison of the groups the p values of the first and last 2 groups were found to be 0.047 (statistically significant). The mean counts of the mesenteric lymph node were 0.7 x 10(3), 1 x 10(10) and 0.9 x 10(6) respectively. The p values were 0.343 for the first and the last 2 groups both. As they were above 0.05, they were not statistically significant. The degrees of liver Kupffer cell hyperplasia were (+) 40%, (+2) 50% and (+3) 10% (group 1), (+) 10%, (+2) 40% and (+3) 50% (group 2), (+2) 60% and (+3) 40% (group 3) (p = 0.0039). The rates of the absence of pathology in mesenteric lymph nodes were 70% (group 1), 90% (group 2) and 100% (group 3) (p = 0.049). These findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We found that splenectomy has activated the whole predisposing factors of bacterial translocation and created the latter itself. In addition, we showed that filgrastim, a recently widespread used G-CSF, decreases bacterial translocation significantly.
TI  - Association of gut inflammation with increased serum IgA class Klebsiella antibody concentrations in patients with axial ankylosing spondylitis (AS): implication for different aetiopathogenetic mechanisms for axial and peripheral AS?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A role for Klebsiella pneumoniae in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has been suggested because faecal carriage of Klebsiella and serum Klebsiella specific antibodies may be increased in this disease. This study has extended the earlier findings by comparing Klebsiella specific serum IgA class antibodies with inflammatory changes in the gut. METHODS: IgA antibodies to K pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis in serum samples of 25 patients with AS, of eight control patients, and of 100 healthy blood donors were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Gut inflammation of the patients was studied by ileocolonoscopy. RESULTS: Increased IgA antibody concentrations to K pneumoniae associated with gut inflammation in patients with axial form of AS. Such association was not seen in patients with peripheral form of AS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may provide further evidence for the role of K pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of AS. However, at least some of the patients with axial AS without gut inflammation, as well as patients with peripheral AS did not have increased K pneumoniae antibody concentrations, which may be regarded as evidence against the direct role of K pneumoniae in the pathogenesis. The aetiopathogenetic mechanisms in the axial and peripheral form of AS may be different.
TI  - [Experimental bladder stone production by human uropathogenic bacteria].
AB  - To investigate the formation of infection stones by 5 bacterial species isolated  from patients with urinary calculi, such as Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, a zinc disc was implanted and 10(6) bacteria were surgically inoculated at the same time into the bladder of male Wistar rats (10 rats per group). Urinary pH was measured on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. The rats were killed on day 7 and the bladder examined for the formation of infection stones. Infection stones were formed in all rats inoculated with P. mirabilis (mean stone weight 29.7 mg), and in 60% of those inoculated with S. saprophyticus (9.7 mg). Small bladder stones were formed in 30% of the rats inoculated with K. pneumoniae and 25% of those inoculated with P. aeruginosa. No bladder stones were formed in the rats inoculated with E. coli. Urinary pH was increased by P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus but was unaffected by the other species. In conclusion, P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus play a significant role in the formation of infection stones.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of blood culture isolates obtained before and after the introduction of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of 1658 blood culture isolates to ciprofloxacin and 13 other antimicrobial agents were determined, and compared with the results for isolates obtained before and after the availability of ciprofloxacin in 1989. Only six (0.6%) of 995 Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested; all of the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were isolated after 1989 (P = 0.04). No significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance was found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. No resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 124 Staphylococcus aureus isolates prior to 1989, but five (2.4%) of 208 S. aureus strains recovered after 1989 were ciprofloxacin-resistant (P = 0.16). Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat bacteraemic infections have remained relatively low in this Canadian teaching hospital over the past 16 years.
TI  - A simple artificial urine for the growth of urinary pathogens.
AB  - A simple artificial urine medium (AUM) has been developed which provides conditions similar to that found in human urine. AUM solidified with agar enabled the recovery of a wide range of urease-positive and -negative urinary pathogens. Liquid AUM supported growth at concentrations of up to 10(8) cfu ml-1, as found in normal urine. Reproducible, steady-state growth also occurred over many generations in continuous culture. AUM was capable of forming crystals and encrustations resembling those found in natural urinary tract infections. The medium is a suitable replacement for normal urine for use in a wide range of experiments modelling the growth and attachment of urinary pathogens in the clinical environment.
TI  - In vivo phase variation of MR/P fimbrial gene expression in Proteus mirabilis infecting the urinary tract.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, associated with complicated urinary tract infection, expresses mannose-resistant/Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae. Expression of these surface structures, which mediate haemagglutination and have a demonstrated role in virulence, undergoes phase variation. By DNA sequence analysis, a 252 bp invertible element was found in the intergenic region between mrpl, the putative site-specific recombinase gene, and mrpA, the primary structural subunit gene. The invertible segment is flanked by identical 21 bp inverted repeats and the presumptive half-sites for recombinase binding show homology to those recognized by FimB and FimE encoded by the Escherichia coli fim (Type 1 fimbriae) gene cluster. When amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from static broth cultures expressing MR/P fimbriae, the switch region was found in both ON and OFF positions. When PCR was used to amplify agar cultures which do not express the fimbriae, the switch region was OFF only. A canonical sigma 70 promoter inside the invertible element drives the transcription of mrpA when in the ON position; in the OFF position it is directed away from mrpA but does not appear to drive expression of mrpI. The mrpI gene was able to confer inversion of the mrp switch region in trans from both ON to OFF and OFF to ON. To examine the position of the switch in vivo, urine, bladder, and kidneys from mice transurethrally infected with P. mirabilis were used to prepare template DNA for PCR amplification. In the absence of urolithiasis (urease-mediated stone formation), the switch was found 100% in the ON position, a condition never observed following in vitro culture. We conclude that MR/P phase variation is regulated at the transcriptional level by the action of MrpI on an invertible element and that there is strong selective pressure for the expression of MR/P fimbriae in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of rabbit leukocyte CAP18(106-137).
AB  - CAP18 is a cationic antimicrobial protein originally isolated from rabbit neutrophils, of which a 32-mer sequence from its C-terminal and (CAP18(106-137)) has been found to be the most active. The bactericidal action of this peptide has been characterized by conventional culture techniques and flow cytometry. Cultures of Escherichia coli NCTC10418 were exposed to the MBC (12 microM) of the peptide for up to 60 min and stained with a fluorochrome sensitive to changes in either membrane potential (bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol [DiBAC4(3)), or membrane integrity (propidium iodide [PI]) before flow cytometric analysis. Addition of CAP18(106-137) to E. coli in broth culture resulted in immediate collapse of membrane potential [as determined by uptake of DiBAC4(3)] and loss of membrane integrity (as indicated by uptake of PI), with a corresponding 6- to 8-log decrease in viable counts as determined by colony formation on solid media. In identical experiments, the presence of Mg2+ (1 to 10 mM), K+ (50 to 250 mM), or EDTA (5 mM) or incubation in nutrient-free buffer or at 4 degrees C had no effect on peptide-induced dye uptake. In contrast, addition of Ca2+ (1 to 10 mM) or the respiratory chain poison carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (50 microM) inhibited the uptake of both dyes. These findings, however, did not relate to bacterial recovery on solid media, where (unless in the presence of K+ 150 to 250 mM) CAP18(106-137) at 12 microM fulfilled the MBC criteria (99.9% killing). We conclude that CAP18(106-137) exerts a rapid and profound action on E. coli cytoplasmic membranes and viability as measured by colony formation. The results suggest, however, that CAP18(106-137) may exert its action at sites additional to the cell membrane and that its activity profile is unique among cationic antimicrobial proteins.
TI  - Evaluation of clonal relatedness of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Proteus mirabilis isolates by quantitative antibiogram and RAPD typing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate, using two different typing systems, the clonal relatedness of 40 isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESbetaIa)-producing Proteus mirabilis obtained over a period of 7 years in six hospitals in the Paris area and two in Pas-de-Calais. METHODS: Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymerase chain reaction typing was applied by using three random primers on the ESbetaIa-producing P. mirabilis isolates and on isogenic Escherichia coli strains with or without plasmids encoding the representative resistance pattern transferred from P. mirabilis. Quantitative antibiogram typing, which was also applied to the P. mirabilis isolates, was used to define the euclidean distance between these strains. RESULTS: After having demonstrated that P. mirabilis plasmids did not influence chromosomal DNA amplification, we could classify the ESbetaIa-producing P. mirabilis isolates into 12 groups based on RAPD fingerprints. The same isolates were classified into 19 groups by quantitative antibiogram typing. Despite this difference in group numbers, general concordance between the typing systems was observed. This allowed us to show that the greater number of isolates in some hospitals belonged to a single strain and that single isolates obtained in different hospitals generally represented unique strains. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of ESbetaIa-producing P. mirabilis strains was isolated during 7 years in the eight medical centers studied, and the number of different strains identified suggested that inter-hospital transfer had not occurred.
TI  - A national collaborative study of the in vitro activity of oral cephalosporins and loracarbef (LY 163892). Australian Group for the Study of Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR).
AB  - A national collaborative study involving the laboratories of 17 Australian hospitals examined the in vitro activity of loracarbef, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate against 2661 recently isolated common bacterial pathogens. Loracarbef was the most active agent against Escherichia coli (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) and had activity comparable to other agents against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Like the oral cephalosporins, it had no activity against species of Enterobacter and Serratia. beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 8 mg/l for both species). Streptococcus pneumoniae was moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) but strains which were insensitive to penicillin were often highly resistant.
TI  - The effect of the bacterial product, succinic acid, on neutrophil bactericidal activity.
AB  - We investigated the effect of succinic acid on neutrophil bactericidal activity in a model of intra-abdominal abscess induced in mice by the peritoneal inoculation of 5 x 10(6) cfu ml-1 E. coli and 5 x 10(8) cfu ml-1 B. fragilis plus 1 mg of bran as faecal fibre analogue. The mean pH of the induced abscesses at week 1 was 6.7, higher than the pH associated with succinic acid inhibitory activity. We therefore determined the effect of succinic acid (0-100 mM) at pH 6.7 on the bactericidal activity of mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophils. Phagocytic killing of Proteus mirabilis by neutrophils was significantly inhibited by 30-100 mM succinic acid at pH 6.7 but there was no significant effect of succinic acid on engulfment of bacteria at this pH. However, significant inhibition of intracellular killing (assayed by adding succinic acid to suspensions of neutrophils which had engulfed bacteria in low serum concentrations but in the absence of succinic acid) was noted at 70 and 100 mM. These results indicate that succinic acid inhibits neutrophil bactericidal activity at a physiological pH, principally through inhibition of intracellular killing mechanisms and therefore contributing to bacterial persistence in this model of abscess formation.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. At the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees C. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. The highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours and 0800 hours, prior to operation. When applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). These mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. CONCLUSION: Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. This fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomanas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Development of resistance to difuracil (PAP-49) in bacteria and its activity in  combination with other antibacterial drugs].
AB  - Possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or N-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(N'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (PAP-49) in Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. It was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. The most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. During the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (E.coli) or was even somewhat higher (S. aureus and Streptococcus sp.). After that a new increase of the resistance was observed. The most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in Streptococcus sp. and the least marked in Staphylococcus sp. and E.coli. Combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to S.epidermidis, S. pneumonase, E.coli and P.mirabilis. The most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.
TI  - The simultaneous production of both Hly- and Hpm-like hemolysins is characteristic of the Proteus penneri species.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Proteus penneri were tested for the presence of genes encoding hemolytic activity. Strains possessing DNA sequences similar to the hlyCABD genes in Escherichia coli were found. Each secreted a 110 kDa protein which reacted with a specific anti-HlyA antiserum. Southern blotting analysis revealed that the HindIII restriction fragment pattern for the hlyCABD genes of these strains was conserved. Similarly, the chromosomal location of these genes is relatively conserved based on the pattern of NotI digested DNA fragments separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. One strain carried an additional copy of the hlyCABD determinant which was mapped on a second NotI genomic fragment. All strains contained also chromosomally encoded sequences related to the hpmBA genes originally cloned from Proteus mirabilis. All strains produced a 166 kDa exoprotein detected in immunoblots with a specific antiserum raised against HpmA hemolysin. The hpmBA genes were located on other NotI fragments than hlyCABD genes. In contrast to the other Proteae, the simultaneous production of both hemolysins seems to be a common characteristics of Proteus penneri isolates.
TI  - Focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: partial nephrectomy as definitive treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We report 11 cases of focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (FXGP), a disease that is very uncommon. The aim of the present work is to assess the effectivity of conservative treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eleven of the 82 cases of XGP (12.5%) diagnosed between 1970 and 1995 presented the focal form (FXGF). Clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological imaging studies, surgical treatment and follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: FXGP occurred in middle-aged women (female/male ratio 4.5:1) who had a history of calculosis, urinary infections produced by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, or urinary tract abnormalities. FXGP was unilateral in all cases. The most frequent symptom was flank pain. Some hematological and biochemical parameters were altered. Intravenous urography and sonography revealed calculosis, hydronephrosis or renal mass, but these findings are nonspecific. Only abdominal CT scan can establish the correct diagnosis. Five of these patients (45.5%) underwent partial nephrectomy at our hospital. During the follow-up, patients showed no relapse in the ipsilateral or contralateral kidney. Serum parameters were in normal range. CONCLUSION: When FXGP is diagnosed, local excision is recommended in all cases, since relapse in the affected kidney is unusual.
TI  - Antibody responses to gut bacteria in ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Specific immunoreactive anti-Klebsiella antibodies are found in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a significant proportion of whom have occult inflammatory bowel disease. Molecular mimicry between Klebsiella or other bacterial antigens and HLA-B27 has been suggested in the pathogenesis of AS. The specificity of increased immunoreactivity against Klebsiella remains to be assessed against the abundant anaerobic bacterial flora, present either in healthy controls or in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Total immunoglobulin (Ig; IgG, IgA, IgM) immunoreactivity was measured by ELISA against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and ten anaerobic isolates of the predominant normal bowel flora in 35 patients with active AS, 60 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (30 CD, 30 UC), 60 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 60 healthy controls. Ig immunoreactivity to K. pneumoniae was significantly elevated in AS (P < 0.001), CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P < 0.001) patients compared with RA patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, Ig immunoreactivity to P. mirabilis was significantly elevated only in RA patients, compared with the other inflammatory groups (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.001). There was no significant antibody response against E. coli or the ten obligate anaerobes in any of the test groups. The data suggested an increased immune response to Klebsiella in patients with AS, UC, CD and to Proteus in patients with RA. The specificity of these responses in some patients supported a possible role for enteric Klebsiella in the pathogenesis of AS and Proteus in RA. The role of Klebsiella in inflammatory bowel disease requires further study.
TI  - Correlation between anti-Proteus antibodies and isolation rates of P. mirabilis in rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - In a survey of 89 RA patients, carried out under code, Proteus mirabilis was isolated from the urine of 63% (47/75) of female (P < 0.001) and 50% (7/14) of male patients (P < 0.001), compared to a frequency of isolation in healthy women of 32% (38/119) and 11% (13/115) in healthy men. There was no significant difference in isolation rates between 37 non-RA patients and healthy controls. Sera from 20 patients with RA and 20 healthy controls were tested against P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibodies against P. mirabilis but not to E. coli were significantly higher in the RA patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between high anti-Proteus antibody levels in serum samples and the number of Proteus colony-forming units obtained from urine specimens of the 20 RA patients (r = +0.714, P < 0.001). These results support the suggestion of an aetiopathogenic role for P. mirabilis in RA.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella, Proteus, and HLA-B27 peptides in Japanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from Japan have antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis and to assess whether such antibodies are activated against peptides sharing sequences with HLA-B27. METHODS: Serum samples from 152 Japanese patients, 52 with AS, 50 with RA, and 50 healthy controls, were tested against 3 bacteria (K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and Escherichia coli) and 3 synthetic peptides (HLA-B27, pullulanase-D, and scrambled pullulanase-D control peptide) by ELISA under coded conditions. Samples were tested for elevations in IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody classes in patients with active AS or RA, in patients with RA with probable disease, and in patients with inactive AS. Disease activity was determined by an elevated serum C-reactive protein (> 10 mg/l) level and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (> 20 mm/h). RESULTS: Patients with active AS showed specific elevations in serum IgA antibody levels against K. pneumoniae compared to patients with RA and controls (p < 0.001). No such elevation was seen in the IgG and IgM antibody classes. Patients with inactive AS showed no elevation in any class of antibody against K. pneumoniae compared to controls or patients with RA. Patients with active or probably active RA showed significant elevations in IgG antibody levels against P. mirabilis compared to AS and controls (p < 0.001). Patients with AS (active or inactive), RA (active or probably active), and controls showed no elevations in any antibody class to E. coli. Both active and inactive AS patients had specific autoantibodies against HLA-B27 peptide compared to patients with RA and controls (active AS: IgG, IgA, IgM, p < 0.001; inactive AS: IgG and IgA, p < 0.001). Patients with active AS had IgG and IgA antibodies against pullulanase-D peptide, which contains a sequence that cross reacts with HLA-B27 compared to controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of AS and RA patients in Japan having specific elevations of antibody to K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, respectively. This suggests that K. pneumoniae in AS and P. mirabilis in RA may play a role in triggering and/or exacerbating these diseases.
TI  - [Expression of synthetic gene for human angiogenin in E. coli cells].
AB  - A synthetic gene for human angiogenin was cloned into pRTang under control of the Proteus mirabilis recA promoter. After induction with mitomycin C, Escherichia coli cells transformed with pRTang produced an additional 14.2-kDa protein. According to electrophoretic and immunochemical analyses, this protein was identical to human angiogenin.
TI  - The effect of positive semen bacterial and Ureaplasma cultures on in-vitro fertilization success.
AB  - A total of 342 couples planning to undergo in-vitro fertilization (IVF) were examined for the presence of bacteria in semen prior to and during the procedure. Pregnancy rates were analysed retrospectively to ascertain any adverse affects if > 10000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml bacteria were detected in the semen sample. The most common bacteria isolated from semen were Enterococcus spp. (73%). The presence of these bacteria did not affect the pregnancy rate of the patients with positive cultures prior to (32%) or during (37%) the IVF procedure compared with those patients in whom no bacteria were detected (32%). Those patients with semen cultures positive for Escherichia coli prior to the IVF procedure, but which cleared after treatment had a higher pregnancy rate (60%) compared with those patients who were positive for E.coli at the time of the attempt. The group of patients with Staphylococcus aureus in the semen at the time of IVF also demonstrated a low pregnancy rate (17%). Of the patients. 36 (11%) had positive Ureaplasma cultures from the screening test carried out on the semen and 22% became pregnant after successful treatment. None of the three patients with persistently positive cultures became pregnant. In conclusion, the presence of Enterococcus in semen does not affect pregnancy rates following IVF. E.coli, S.aureus and Ureaplasma urealyticum may have a negative effect and should be treated.
TI  - A study on the nutritive value of pollen from the Chinese Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana) and its effect on fecal characteristics in rats.
AB  - A digestion experiment with growing rats was conducted to study the effect of native and broken pollen of Chinese Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana) on fecal composition and digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein and crude ash. For that issue each 10 of 30 animals were fed a semisynthetic diet containing either no pollen or and addition of 6% native or broken pollen for 17 days at restricted amounts. In a second experiment each 6 of 12 growing rats received a semisynthetic diet containing either no or 5% broken pollen. At day 4, 11 and 18 samples of the feces were collected and analyzed for mesophilic aerobic bacteria. The pollen contained large amounts of cell wall constituents (26-30% lignin and 10-15% cellulose, 2-13% hemicellulose) with higher values found in native pollen. The contents of crude protein, crude fat, total lipids, available carbohydrates (starch and sugars), crude ash, gross energy and metabolizable energy were 13%, 2-10%, 8-10%, 17-18%, 3.1-3.5%, 21-22 kJ/g and 5.7-9.0 kJ/g. The addition of native pollen to the diet increased the total amount of feces by 71% as compared to the control level. The fecal contents of dry matter and of crude protein and crude ash in fecal dry matter changed by -5, +4 and -5 percentage units. The apparent digestibilites of dry matter and crude protein decreased by 3 and 5 percentage units, respectively, while the apparent digestibility of crude ash remained unchanged. Broken pollen acted in the same direction, however the effects were about 20% less pronounced as compared to native pollen. The pollen feeding reduced the fecal germ contents of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, while the amounts of alpha-hemolysing streptococci was increased. In total, the observed effects of an addition of native broken or pollen to the diet seemed to be based mainly on the increased intake of cell wall constituents.
TI  - The prevalence of gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in the Proteeae and its role  in the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  - The prevalence of aac(2')-Ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in Providencia stuartii, among species of the Proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in P. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan O-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. An evaluation of the MICs of gentamicin for each of the species of the Proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of O-acetylation of peptidoglycan. The entire aac(2')-Ia gene was used as a probe in Southern hybridization experiments against genomic DNA from each species of the Proteeae. A sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-Ia was present only in Proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also observed to the restriction digested DNA from Providencia rettgeri. Other bacteria that O-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a homologous DNA sequence was only found in Neisseria subflava. These data suggest that AAC(2')-Ia may contribute to the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan in P. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.
TI  - A bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Morganella morganii at low pH.
AB  - To infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach. In this study, we showed that Y. enterocolitica serotype O8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as pH 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. Acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-pH conditions. Acid tolerance of Helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was not specifically activated by low-pH conditions. A ure mutant strain of Y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea was the sole nitrogen source. Examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that Morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but Escherichia coli 1021, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. Consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases were activated in vitro by low pH with an unusually low activity optimum of pH 5.5. In whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below pH 3.0 for Y. enterocolitica and pH 5.5 for M. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. DNA sequence analysis of portions of the M. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of Y. enterocolitica urease. One region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of Lactobacillus fermentum. This region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases since the L. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low pH optimum for activity.
TI  - [Suprapubic bladder aspiration. Utility and complication].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims at evaluating the usefulness of suprapubic bladder aspiration (SBA) in order to diagnose urinary tract infection (UTI), enumerating the complications and describes those found in the existing literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have reviewed the 668 SBAs carried out on 642 children over a period of 3 years. The ages of the children varied from neonate to 5 years. Urine cultures were regarded as positive when any one single germ showed bacterial growth signs. RESULTS: Ninety-four UTIs, 14.6% of the total samples studied, were detected, five of which were in newborns. Infection by Escherichia coli comprised 87.2% of the total. Two complications were observed: needle breakage and vaginal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: SBA is a reliable method, with hardly any complications, and is essential for the accurate diagnosis of UTI. However, it must be used with a more restrictive criterion in the neonatal period.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - An assessment of the ability of a silver-releasing device to prevent bacterial contamination of urethral catheter drainage systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of a silver-releasing device to protect the catheterized bladder from infection by blocking the ascending migration of bacteria from contaminated urine-drainage bags. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A simple physical model of the catheterized bladder and drainage system was used with the device located in the drainage-tube just below the sampling port. Urine was supplied to the model at 1.0 mL/min and the drainage bag was contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Over 10 days, urine from the bag, catheter sampling-port and bladder were examined for contamination. RESULTS: Bacteriological analysis showed that the mean time for test organisms to reach the sampling ports of four different control bag systems ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 days. Urine from the sampling ports of the test systems incorporating the silver device remained sterile for 10 days. The device also prevented the growth of the large populations of bacteria (10(8) colony-forming units per mL) that occurred in the control bags. While scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of bacterial biofilm throughout the control drainage systems, no bacterial colonization was visible on the surfaces of the test systems. Chemical analysis established that the devices consistently generated concentrations of silver in urine ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/mL. CONCLUSION: The incorporation of the silver-releasing device into the drainage systems produced an antibacterial barrier which protected the catheterized bladder from intraluminal contamination for at least 10 days. These in vitro tests suggest a useful role for the device in controlling infection in patients undergoing short-term indwelling bladder catheterization.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis ambient-temperature fimbriae: cloning and nucleotide sequence of the aft gene cluster.
AB  - Uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis produces at least four types of fimbriae. Amino acid sequences from two peptides, derived by tryptic digestion of the structural subunit of one type of these fimbriae, the ambient-temperature fimbriae, were determined: NVVPGQPSSTQ and LIEGENQLNYNA. PCR primers, based on these sequences and that of the N terminus, were used to amplify a 359-bp fragment. A cosmid clone, isolated from a P. mirabilis genomic library by hybridization with the 359-bp PCR product, was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the atf gene cluster. A 3,903-bp region encodes three polypeptides: AtfA, the structural subunit; AtfB, the chaperone; and AtfC, the outer membrane molecular usher. No fimbria-related genes are evident either 5' or 3' to the three contiguous genes. AtfA demonstrates significant amino acid sequence identity with type 1 major fimbrial subunits of several enteric species. The 359-bp PCR product hybridized strongly with all Proteus isolates (n = 9) and 25% of 355 Escherichia coli isolates but failed to hybridize with any of 26 isolates among nine other uropathogenic species. Ambient-temperature fimbriae of P. mirabilis may represent a novel type of fimbriae of enteric species.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum.
AB  - Ten sesquiterpene lactones and one sesquiterpene isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum: 1 alpha, 6 alpha -dihydroxyisocostic acid methyl ester (2), 1 alpha-hydroxy-1-deoxoarglanine (3), douglanin (5), santamarin (6), reynosin (7), 1-epitatridin B (8), ludovicin A (10), armexin (12), armefolin (13), armexifolin (14), and 3 alpha-hydroxyreynosin (15) were tested against the human lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 and the colorectal cancer cell line COLO 320 as well as against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, two germacranolides tatridin A (16) and tamirin (17) were included in the study. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 124 microM) but most of them were not effective in the antimicrobial tests.
TI  - Is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  - The regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for Escherichia coli. The clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. The addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except P. mirabilis. However, when clinical strains of E. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. There was no difference in growth rates of E. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. The ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.
TI  - Evaluation of 500 gram negative isolates to determine the number of major susceptibility interpretation discrepancies between the Vitek and MicroScan Walkaway for 9 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Although the Vitek and MicroScan Walkaway are two of the most commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems, few studies have been performed comparing discrepancies between these systems. In this study, 500 Gram negative clinical isolates were tested against ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin to determine the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems. The 500 isolates consisted of 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter species. Each isolate was tested simultaneously in both systems using the same standardized inoculum. Eighty-four major discrepancies occurred, of which 48 were reproducible. The reproducible discrepancy rate, for the 4,500 isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested, was 48 of 4500 (1.06%). The rate for individual antimicrobics varied from 17 of 500 (3.4%) for ampicillin to no discrepancies for ticarcillin or ciprofloxacin. Of the 48 reproducible discrepancies, 44 (92%) were Vitek resistant, MicroScan susceptible. Fifteen (31%) of the Vitek and 21 (44%) of the MicroScan results were confirmed by broth microdilution. Disk diffusion results were in agreement with 15 (31%) of the Vitek and 21 (44%) of the MicroScan results. Twelve (25%) of the broth microdilution and 12 (25%) of the disk diffusion results were intermediate. The broth microdilution and disk diffusion results for the 48 isolates with reproducible discrepancies were in agreement more often with MicroScan. However, there was less very major error comparing the Vitek results for these isolates to the broth microdilution and disk diffusion. Overall, the result of this evaluation indicate that the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems is minimal for the isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested.
TI  - Molecular cloning and overexpression of a glutathione transferase gene from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The structural gene of the Proteus mirabilis glutathione transferase GSTB1-1 (gstB) has been isolated from genomic DNA. A nucleotide sequence determination of gstB predicted a translational product of 203 amino acid residues, perfectly matching the sequence of the previously purified protein [Mignogna, Allocati, Aceto, Piccolomini, Di Ilio, Barra and Martini (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 211, 421-425]. The P. mirabilis GST sequence revealed 56% identity with the Escherichia coli GST at DNA level and 54% amino acid identity. Similarity has been revealed also with the translation products of the recently cloned gene bphH from Haemophilus influenzae (28% identity) and ORF3 of Burkholderia cepacia (27% identity). Putative promoter sequences with high similarity to the E. coli sigma 70 consensus promoter and to promoters of P. mirabilis cat and glnA genes preceded the ATG of the gstB open reading frame (ORF). gstB was brought under control of the tac promoter and overexpressed in E. coli by induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside and growth at 37 degrees C. The physicochemical and catalytic properties of overexpressed protein were indistinguishable from those of the enzyme purified from P. mirabilis extract. Unlike the GST belonging to Mu and Theta classes, GSTB1-1 was unable to metabolize dichloromethane. The study of the interaction of cloned GSTB1-1 with a number of antibiotics indicates that this enzyme actively participates in the binding of tetracyclines and rifamycin.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in patients with short-term indwelling.
AB  - Seventy patients (44(62.9%) females) requiring short-term urinary bladder catheterisation at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi formed the study population. Their mean ages +/- SD was 41+/- 26 years (range 13-100 years). The common indications and objectives for catheterisation included keeping the environment dry (41.1%), relieving urinary retention (27.0%) and urinary incontinence (24.3%). Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) was documented in 48 (68.6%) of the patients. The commonest infection organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, the three accounting for 78.6% of the infections. Female gender and increasing age increased the risk of catheter-associated UTI. The risk of having catheter-associated UTI was higher in patients with medical and surgical conditions than in those with obstetric and gynaecology conditions. Patients who were on systemic antibiotics for other conditions acquired UTI less often (27%) than those who were not undergoing antibiotic therapy. The organisms isolated showed marked resistance to commonly available antibiotics. We conclude that UTI, due to resistant organisms, is common in patients undergoing acute urinary bladder catheterisation in our setting and recommend that urinary bladder catheterisation should be avoided whenever possible. In a situation where this is inevitable, closed drainage systems should be used for the shortest duration possible.
TI  - Preputial condition and urinary tract infections.
AB  - Recently, an increase in incidences of urinary tract infections in uncircumcised  male infants has been reported. However, determining what is the best management for the prepuce of newborns and infants is still to be solved. I investigated prospectively how much foreskins are retracted with age and what correlations it has with urinary tract infection in 122 males children below 15 years of age. Under 6 months of age, the majority of the foreskins were unretractable. As they got older, over 3 years of age, their prepuces became retractable. The incidence of bacteriuria was 11.4% in uncircumcised but none in circumcised and hypospadias. In 8 patients showing bacteriuria, their foreskins were retracted below 25% in length. Among them, 5 patients, in whom E. coli were grown in their urine, showed radiologic renal abnormalities and suffered from high fever indicating systemic infection. However, the other 3 cases infected by Proteus mirabilis in their urine complained of only local penile symptoms.
TI  - Characterization of an inhibitor-resistant enzyme IRT-2 derived from TEM-2 beta-lactamase produced by Proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  - Ten clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis were found to produce an inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase (IRT) in association with a TEM-1 enzyme. The IRT enzyme was derived from TEM-2. The blaIRT gene differs from blaTEM-2 gene by one point mutation which leads to the amino-acid substitution Arg-->Ser at position 244, as observed for the original IRT-2 enzyme derived from TEM-1 reported in Escherichia coli. This is the first report of an IRT beta-lactamase derived from TEM-2.
TI  - Activation of transcription at divergent urea-dependent promoters by the urease gene regulator UreR.
AB  - The Proteus mirabilis and plasmid-encoded urease loci contain seven contiguous structural and accessory genes (ureDABCEFG) and the divergently transcribed ureR, which codes for an AraC-like transcriptional activator. Previously, it was shown that the plasmid-encoded ureR to ureD intergenic region contained divergent promoters (ureRp and ureDp). Transcription from these promoters required both the effector molecule urea and the activator protein UreR. In this report, we demonstrate that the P. mirabilis urease gene cluster contains similar divergent urea- and UreR-dependent promoters. The ureR gene products from either urease locus were able to activate transcription at both the plasmid-encoded and P. mirabilis promoters. The minimal concentration of urea required to activate transcription at ureRp or ureDp from either gene cluster was approximately 4 mM. The transcriptional start sites for the plasmid-encoded and P. mirabilis divergent promoters were similar in an Escherichia coli DH5 alpha background, as determined by primer-extension analysis. However, in P. mirabilis HI4320, transcription of ureR initiated predominately at an alternative site. Physical mapping and inhibition studies were used to localize the UreR-binding sites within the plasmid-encoded ureRp and ureDp intergenic sequences to regions of 68 bp and 86 bp, respectively. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that UreR bound to a 135 bp fragment in the approximate centre of the plasmid-encoded ureR to ureD intergenic region. The results presented here suggest that the P. mirabilis and plasmid-encoded urease gene clusters utilize similar mechanisms of transcriptional activation in response to urea.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - Survey of prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - During the first six months of 1990 and 1994 respectively, 3179 and 2721 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated at the teaching hospital of Clermont-Ferrand. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found in 147 isolates, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 37) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 15). TEM-3/CTX-1, SHV-4/CAZ-5 and TEM-24/CAZ-6 were the prevalent enzymes. However, the most frequently involved enzyme in 1990 was TEM-3 (48.6%) whereas in 1994 it was SHV-4 (56.0%). Two salient features emerged from this study: the high frequency of TEM-3 production in P. mirabilis and the production of SHV-4 enzyme, heretofore observed solely in K. pneumoniae, in two other species, E. aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Intracellular survival of enteric bacteria in cultured human enterocytes.
AB  - Translocating enteric bacteria have been visualized within intact intestinal epithelial cells in animal models of bacterial translocation. Although the ability of the enterocyte to engulf bacteria has been well documented in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models, relatively little is known about the enterocyte's ability to degrade internalized bacteria. Intracellular survival of eight strains of enteric bacteria (two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, two strains of Escherichia coli, and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis) was quantified over a 20 h period using two different types of terminally differentiated polarized enterocytes considered relevant in vitro models of human small intestinal epithelium, namely Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Caco-2 enterocytes were generally more permissive for bacterial uptake when compared with HT-29 enterocytes. However, bacterial survival was similar within each type of enterocyte, and most strains of enteric bacteria remained viable within enterocytes for the 20 h duration of the assay. In addition, with the exception of one strain of L. monocytogenes in Caco-2 cells, intracellular enteric bacteria had no noticeable effect on host enterocyte viability for this 20 h duration. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize both intact and degraded bacteria within individual enterocytes, suggesting that prolonged bacterial survival might have resulted from simultaneous bacterial degradation and replication. Thus, although enterocytes internalize enteric bacteria, enterocytes might not kill internalized bacteria as efficiently as leukocytes. Observations of bacterial intracellular survival supported the hypothesis that the enterocyte might be a portal of entry for translocating microbes, and observations of intracellular bacterial degradation might have implications for the role of the enterocyte as an antigen-presenting cell.
TI  - Evaluation of CHROMagar Orientation for differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and Enterococcus species.
AB  - A new chromogenic plate medium, CHROMagar Orientation, was evaluated for use in the differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and Enterococcus species by a multipoint inoculation (replicator) technique. In this study, 1,404 gram-negative bacilli and 74 enterococcal isolates were tested on CHROMagar Orientation. Six control American Type Culture Collection strains were also included with the testing to ensure quality control of the media. Of the Escherichia coli isolates (n = 588) tested, 99.3% produced a pink-to-red color. Only in four isolates that were O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) negative did this result differ. Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris were well differentiated on this medium. P. mirabilis (n = 184) produced a clear colony with diffusible brown pigment around the periphery. By contrast, 15 of 16 P. vulgaris isolates produced bluish-green colonies with a slight brown background. All Aeromonas hydrophila isolates (n = 26) tested produced clear to pink colonies at 35 to 37 degrees C. This colony color changed to blue after 2 to 3 h of incubation at room temperature. A. hydrophila exhibited stronger color and better growth at 30 degrees C. Serratia marcescens (n = 29) demonstrated an aqua blue color that deepened to a darker blue when exposed to room temperature. All enterococcal isolates (n = 74) resulted in a blue color and gave pinpoint colonies on purity subcultures at 35 to 37 degrees C after 18 h of incubation. Similarity in color resulted in failure to discriminate accurately between Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species. However, these species could be readily differentiated from other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 151) was easily differentiated from members of the Enterobacteriaceae but was less easily distinguishable from other gram-negative nonmembers of the Enterobacteriaceae. The medium was found to facilitate easy visual detection of mixed bacterial isolates in culture. When used in a replicator system, it easily detected mixed growths of organisms which may have otherwise led to false antibiotic susceptibility results. These mixed growths were not obvious on the routine susceptibility testing medium (Isosensitest).
TI  - Douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. Two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and (or) Pythium spp. in in vitro assays. A significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. Eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were Streptomyces, Streptoverticillium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, or Burkholderia species. The actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. Recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings from nursery and forest sites. Bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, Inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. Strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of urinary tract infections: selecting an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic for nosocomial infections.
AB  - Clinical and in vitro data indicate that cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, may be a valuable addition in the treatment of serious infections. In this study, hospitalized patients with complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), for which parenteral therapy was appropriate, were enrolled in a 2:1 ratio open, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of cefepime and ceftazidime. A total of 180 patients, including 6 with concurrent bacteremia, were evaluated for their response to cefepime (n = 118) or ceftazidime (n = 62), both of which were administered by intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection in doses of 500 mg every 12 hours. In cases of complicated UTI, cefepime produced a satisfactory clinical response in 83 of 93 (89%) patients and eradicated 83 of 98 (85%) pathogens. A satisfactory clinical response to ceftazidime was experienced by 43 of 50 (86%) patients; and in 39 of 50 (78%) cases pathogens were eradicated. In uncomplicated cases, the clinical response and bacterial eradication rates for cefepime were 23 of 25 (92%) and 22 of 26 (85%), respectively, and for ceftazidime 12 of 12 (100%) and 11 of 12 (92%). Of the 6 patients with concomitant bacteremia, 5 received cefepime and 1, ceftazidime. The infecting organisms, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, were eradicated in all cases, although one cefepime-treated patient had an unsatisfactory clinical response. The most common adverse events in both groups were headache, diarrhea, and vomiting; most events were unrelated to therapy. Adverse events forced only a 2% withdrawal of patients in either group. There was local tolerance to both agents, and abnormalities in laboratory values were judged to be clinically insignificant. The results of this study indicate that cefepime can be used safely and successfully to treat both complicated and uncomplicated nosocomial infection of the urinary tract, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia. Moreover, its safety profile appears comparable to those of other cephalosporins, and local tolerance is similar to that of ceftazidime. No patient in either group required discontinuation of therapy because of local intolerance at the infusion or injection site.
TI  - Sonographically guided aspiration: an alternative therapy for tubo-ovarian abscess.
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the role of single-step ultrasound-guided aspiration in conjunction with intracavitary antibiotic instillation for the treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess. Ten women with the clinical and sonographic diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess, who failed to respond to systemic antibiotic therapy, were treated by ultrasound-guided aspiration of the abscess followed by intracavitary instillation of a combination of antibiotics. All ten women improved clinically and none required surgery. The mean time from aspiration to hospital discharge was 3.1 days with mean duration of hospitalization 7.8 days. No major complications were observed. The average time interval between aspiration of the lesion and resolution on sonographic follow-up was 9.5 weeks. In three cases, pelvic inflammatory disease recurred, but none needed surgical intervention. The average follow-up period of the patients was 12 months. One-step sonographically guided aspiration of tubo-ovarian abscess followed by intracavitary antibiotic instillation may serve as an easy and safe alternative therapy in patients in whom treatment with systemic antibiotics has failed.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1994 to May 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. No remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated UTIs. Against E. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. As for Klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to ABPC decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. Against P. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.

TI  - Effect of hypoxia on enterocyte endocytosis of enteric bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effect of hypoxia on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.  DESIGN: Randomized. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Enteric bacterial and cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, HT-29 cells. INTERVENTIONS: The effect of hypoxia on bacterial internalization and intracellular survival was studied, using enterocytes cultured for 21 days in either 20%, 10%, or 5% oxygen. The effect of bacterial growth conditions on bacterial internalization by enterocytes was studied, using bacterial cells in either the log phase or stationary phase of aerobic growth, and using bacterial cells in stationary phase, grown either under low oxygen conditions or under anaerobic conditions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Individual strains of enteric bacteria were incubated with HT-29 cells for 1 hr. Numbers of internalized bacteria were subsequently quantified after enterocyte lysis. Bacterial growth conditions (anaerobic vs. aerobic and log-phase vs. stationary-phase bacterial cells) had no noticeable effect on the numbers of Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli internalized by enterocytes. Enterocytes cultivated in 20%, 10%, or 5% oxygen were >95% viable. Enterocytes cultivated in 20% oxygen were confluent, but those enterocytes cultivated in hypoxia were not confluent and were fewer in number compared with enterocytes cultivated in normoxia. Compared with enterocytes grown in normoxia, enterocytes cultivated in 5% and 10% oxygen internalized greater numbers of each of seven strains of enteric bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes (two strains), Enterococcus faecalis (two strains), and P. mirabilis, E. coli (two strains), with statistically significant increases noted for five of these seven bacterial strains. Intracellular survival of L. monocytogenes and P. mirabilis was assayed. Both species survived intracellularly for 22 hrs, with no noticeable differences in the numbers of intracellular bacteria recovered from enterocytes cultivated in 20%, 10%, and 5% oxygen. CONCLUSION: These in vitro results suggest that augmented bacterial endocytosis by enterocytes might at least partially explain the increased frequency of bacterial translocation associated with tissue ischemia.
TI  - Antibodies to four gram-negative bacteria in rheumatoid arthritis which share sequences with the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility motif.
AB  - The bacteria Proteus, Serratia, Escherichia and Pseudomonas possess sequences resembling the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility sequence EQRRAA, but antibodies were elevated only to Proteus in 66 RA patients (P<0.001) when compared to 61 active ankylosing spondylitis patients and 60 controls.
TI  - The associated microflora to the larvae of human bot fly Dermatobia hominis L. Jr. (Diptera: Cuterebridae) and its furuncular lesions in cattle.
AB  - The microflora associated to furuncular lesions, larvae and pupae of Dermatobia hominis, as well as the relationships between parasite, host and microflora associated, as a comprehensive microsystem, has been studied. One hundred and two furuncular myiasis due to D. hominis larvae in several breeds of cattle were studied and the following bacterial species were significant: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. warneri, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Closely related, the microflora associated to 141 samples from first, second, third instar larva and both external surface and larval cavities has been studied. The representative associated microflora to the larvae were: S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. hycus and Moraxella phenylpiruvica, Moerella wisconsiensis, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, M. phenylpiruvica, M. wisconsiensis, P. mirabilis and P. rettgeri were the representative microflora associated to 64 pupae of D. hominis.
TI  - Prevalence, antimicrobial properties and beta-lactamase production of haemolytic  enterobacteria in patients with diarrhoea and urinary tract infections in Legos, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, antimicrobial properties and beta-lactamase production of haemolytic enterobacteria in patients with diarrhoea and urinary tract infections in Lagos, Nigeria. DESIGN: Hospital based prospective study. SUBJECTS: Total of 324 patients comprising 194 diarrhoeal and 130 urinary tract infection (UTI) cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Production of haemolysms. beta-lactamase and antibiograms of isolates. RESULTS: 186 (57.41 pc) of the 324 clinical specimens screened were positive for enterobacteria, out of which 29 (15.59 pc) were haemolytic. Proteus vulgaris (2.78 pc) Klebsiella spp. (1.85pc). Escherichia coli (1.23 pc). Pseudomonas spp. (0.93 pc). Yersinia enterocolitics and Morganella morganii (0.62 pc). Salmonella spp. Vibrio cholerae and Proteus mirabilis (0.31pc) were the haemolytic enterobacteria Isolated. The susceptibilities of haemolytic bacteria to eight antibotics determined by disc-agar diffusion technique revealed that all 29 (100 pc) haemolytic isolates were sensitive to gentamycin and streptomycin but showed varied susceptibilities to the other drugs. Eleven (37.9 pc) of the 29 isolates produced beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: We conclude that gentamycin and streptomycin are effective drugs against haemolytic isolates from diarrhoea and UTI cases.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.

CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone (1,000 milligrams intravenously) in abdominal tissues during open prostatectomy.
AB  - Ceftriaxone concentrations in abdominal tissues were evaluated at different stages of open prostatectomy. Ceftriaxone was administered as antibiotic prophylaxis, and 15 consecutive patients were given a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 mg intravenously in 1 min) 30 min before surgery. Ceftriaxone concentrations in tissue were determined at three stages of the surgical procedure; upon the opening of the abdominal cavity, during the prostatectomy, and upon the closure of the abdominal cavity. Samples of the following tissues or sample were assayed: epiploic and abdominal-wall fat; Retzius' space, bladder, and prostate tissue; and urine. During the different stages of the surgical procedure, for all patients, and in the different tested tissues, ceftriaxone concentrations greater than or equal to the cutoff point (4 micrograms/g of tissue) were measured. The highest concentrations were obtained in the bladder (43 +/- 18 micrograms/g) and in the prostate (35 +/- 18 micrograms/g). In fatty tissues, concentrations were between 13 +/- 5 and 22 +/- 8 micrograms/g. All patients (15 of 15) had ceftriaxone levels in tissue greater than the MICs for the potential pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). In conclusion, during open prostatectomy and after the use of a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 mg), high antibiotic levels were obtained throughout the surgical procedure in the tissues potentially involved in postoperative infection.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin modulates epithelial permeability and bacterial  internalization by HT-29 enterocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured HT-29 enterocytes. Experiments were designed to determine the effect of B. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. METHODS: Confluent HT-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with B. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, Salmonella typhimurium (two strains), Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli (three strains), and Enterococcus faecalis. Enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. RESULTS: B. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. Enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of L. monocytogenes (P < 0.01) but increased (P < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. Augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. CONCLUSIONS: B. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with HT-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [Evaluation of chromogenic medium CPS ID2 (bioMerieux) in urine cultures].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the chromogenic agar plate CPS ID2 (bioMerieux) and determine its cost-benefit ratio. METHODS: A total of 2,193 urinary sediments were processed. The urine culture was carried out in CPS ID2 agar and in cystine-lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar, when needed. Identification of the microorganisms was performed following standard microbiologic procedures through biochemical tests prepared in our laboratory. The identification, from CPS ID2 agar, by direct detection in medium of four metabolic activities: beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, deaminase, and indol production, was performed following to manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: A total of 289 urine cultures were positive, 18 were negative and 34 were contaminated samples. The identification, directly performed from the colonies detected in CPS ID2 agar, was correct in 96% of 166 Escherichia coli, in 92% of 24 Proteus mirabilis and in 97% of 38 enterococci. CPS ID2 agar exhibited 94% and 100% sensitivity and specificity, respectively in E. coli identification, 92% and 100% in P. mirabilis and 97% and 99% in Enterococcus. The use of this new media, CPS ID2, in our laboratory, implies a budgetary increment. However, if commercial galleries are used for routine identification, the cost will be reduced using this new media. CONCLUSIONS: The CPS ID2 agar allows the isolation and direct identification of the most frequent urinary tract pathogens: E. coli, P. mirabilis and Enterococcus in primary isolation medium. Using this medium, bacteriologists will be able to save time and reagents when identifying the most common uropathogens. Furthermore, the use of this medium would reduce costs in some laboratories.
TI  - Variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact DAPI-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  - As current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) are attractive. In this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic acids are used to identify bacterial cells. Bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with SdFFF if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant. The effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. Specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. Specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. Specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. Such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the SdFFF technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. Moreover, they have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.
TI  - Bacterial reduction of N-oxides of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA).
AB  - 1. Contrary to established metabolic pattern, a recent investigation of NNK metabolism produced in rat urine higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) than their N-oxides, suggesting that reconversion of N-oxides could occur after urine formation. 2. To verify the possible role of bacteria in the reduction of NNK-N-oxide and NNAL-N-oxide to their respective parent compounds, NNK and NNAL, in smokers with urinary tract infection (UTI), the N-oxides were isolated from the urine of rats treated with [5-3H]NNK and individually incubated at 37 degrees C with ten bacterial species in sterile human urine under different pH regimens. After incubation with the bacteria, aliquots of culture media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with radiochemical detection. 3. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis possessed varying capacity to regenerate NNK and NNAL from their N-oxides while others showed no detectable reductive capability within 24 h. 4. This result constitutes the first experimental evidence that in tobacco users with concomitant UTI, bacterial regeneration of the procarcinogenic NNK and NNAL from their N-oxides could occur in the bladder leading to increased carcinogen burden in these individuals.
TI  - A survey of sixty turkey flocks exhibiting hepatic foci taken at time of processing.
AB  - Fifty turkey flocks including 24 16-week-old male flocks and 26 20-week-old male  flocks were sampled at time of processing. Hepatic foci were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The majority of these did not have any bacteria recovered from the lesions. Of the bacteria that were recovered, most were facultative anaerobes, with Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. comprising the most common isolates. All of the birds examined (300 total) for parasites were infected with varying levels of Ascaridia dissimilis. The highest average worm burden was found in the 20-week-old flocks. Heterakis gallinarum were found in only a few of the younger turkeys (16 weeks old) and not in any of the older birds. An analysis of the spatial distribution of the hepatic foci performed in an additional 10 turkey flocks (500 birds) revealed that, although present on the surface of all regions of the liver, 56.12% of the lesions were found on the left hepatic lobe and 43.88% were found on the right hepatic lobe.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial.
AB  - The aim of this multicentered, prospective and open study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 79 adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) requiring hospitalization. Forty-seven women and 32 men (mean age 54.2 years, and range 21-91) from 4 Argentinean and 6 Mexican hospitals were enrolled. Sixty-one clinically and bacteriologically evaluable patients were treated for a mean of 9.1 days (range 5-15). A favorable clinical response was seen in 83.6% and 80% at early and late assessment, respectively. Bacteriological eradication was achieved in 85.3% and 80% at early and late estimation, respectively. Escherichia coli was isolated in 33 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 8, Enterococcus spp. in 7, Proteus mirabilis in 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii in 2. While 21% of all the clinical isolates were resistant to piperacillin, none of them was initially resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, one female patient with a persistent UTI caused by E. coli developed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam during treatment. A 64-year-old man with frontal meningioma developed purulent meningitis due to Enterobacter cloacae after neurosurgery. He was initially treated with ciprofloxacin, rifampin and amikacin and because of persistence of fever, he was moved to piperacillin/tazobactam. After 5 days of therapy, he developed coma secondary to intracranial hemorrhage and died. By then, the platelet count was normal (220,000/microliters), but the prothrombin time (19.5 seconds) and the partial thromboplastin time (63 seconds) were significantly prolonged. Our data suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a reliable therapy for complicated, non-complicated, community or hospital-acquired UTI.
TI  - [A case of psoas abscess associated in the elderly].
AB  - A case of psoas abscess associated with diabetes mellitus in the elderly is reported. A 81-year-old male who had been followed for cerebral thrombosis, diabetes mellitus and basal cell carcinoma was admitted to our hospital because of high fever. Leukocytosis, a positive CRP test and pyuria were seen. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were detected by urine and blood culture, respectively. He was treated with antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection and sepsis. After starting treatment, a low grade fever continued. On the twenty first hospital day he developed pyrexia again, and a large abscess was demonstrated in the right psoas muscle by pelvic couputed tomography. The abscess was drained and a specimen from it yielded E. coli on culture. Treatment with antibiotics and drainage resulted in symptomatic improvement. In Japan, 82 cases of psoas abscess have been reported from 1990 to 1994. Four cases of these reports were above eighty years old. The experience with this case indicates the necessity of adequate care in cases of elderly diabetes complicated by psoas abscess.
TI  - Endophthalmitis in patients with retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the treatment and outcomes of patients presenting with concurrent endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification between 1990 and 1994. RESULTS: Five patients were identified with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. In all patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci were cultured from the vitreous fluid. One patient also had positive cultures for Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. The interval between cataract surgery and treatment ranged from 5 days to 6 months. Echography was beneficial in showing retained lens fragments in five of five patients when media opacities obscured the view of the fundus. Four patients had vitrectomy and removal of retained lens fragments during their initial treatment. The fifth patient was treated with intravitreal antibiotics alone and continued to have marked inflammation, eventually requiring vitrectomy for removal of the retained lens fragments. A final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in four of the five patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients may present with endophthalmitis in the setting of retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. In such cases, the preferred initial management may be pars plana vitrectomy, removal of retained lens fragments, and injection of intraocular antibiotics. In eyes with endophthalmitis and opaque media, echography is a useful screening modality.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaPER-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Evidence that orthotopic transposition following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation corrects overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - An overgrowth of pathogenic organisms occurs following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation. This study assessed whether the bacterial microflora return to normal following subsequent orthotopic transposition of the graft. After 14 days the heterotopic graft was placed into continuity following resection of 15 cm of the host midintestinal loop. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intraluminal bacteria were performed studying the resected host intestine, the heterotopic graft at 14 days, and the graft 14 days after transposition. A group of normal rats were used as controls. An overgrowth of Staphylococcus epidermidis evident in the heterotopic graft at 14 days returned to a more normal bacterial profile following orthotopic transposition. These findings suggest that early interposition of a small bowel graft into an orthotopic position may prevent an alteration in the small bowel ecology toward potentially pathogenic organisms capable of translocation.
TI  - Methanol extracts LPS from deep rough bacteria.
AB  - Several rough strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Proteus mirabilis were cultivated in the presence of (14C)acetate, which incorporated into their phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide. Phospholipids were removed from the cells with ethanol extraction. However, as shown by thin layer chromatography, methanol additionally extracted remarkable quantities of lipopolysaccharide from deep rough strains, but not from bacteria containing complete or nearly complete core.
TI  - Uterine, cervical and vaginal microflora of the normal bitch throughout the reproductive cycle.
AB  - Samples for microbiological culture were collected from the uterus of bitches using transcervical uterine cannulation (31 samples, 23 bitches) and from the uterus, cervix and vagina post mortem (19 bitches) at all stages of the reproductive cycle. Samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and for aerobic mycoplasmas. Bacteria were always found in the uterus during pro-oestrus and oestrus (12 positive in 12 cultures) and rarely at other stages of the reproductive cycle: during anoestrus (one in 14) and other stages (none in 24). When microorganisms were detected at three sites post mortem, those found in the cervix and vagina were always of the same species as those found in the uterus. In six out of 13 instances, microorganisms were found in the cervix or vagina when none were found in the uterus. The mean number of isolates, number of bacteria seen in uterine cytology and bacterial growth were greater (P < 0.005) during oestrus and pro-oestrus than at other stages. Bacteria isolated from the uterus, in order of frequency, were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus species, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium species, Streptococcus canis, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacteroides species, Pasteurella species and Proteus mirabilis. No mycoplasmas were cultured from the samples. This study indicates that the uterus of the normal bitch has a uterine microflora during pro-oestrus and oestrus that is similar to that of the vagina and cervix.
TI  - Screening of in vitro antibacterial activity from Syzygium Guineense (Willd) hydrosoluble dry extract.
AB  - Diarrhoea is one of the most important causes of infant mortality in the world. As modern drugs are expensive or unavailable in developing countries, many people use traditional medicines in Africa for the treatment of several diseases. In our study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of Syzygium Guineense extract in order to assess its activity on some bacterial strains involved in diarrhoeal diseases and to justify its use. The aqueous dry extract was prepared by decoction followed by evaporating to dryness and tested according to dilution method. This extract showed an antibacterial activity against some bacterial strains: Salmonella E., Shigella D., Shigella F., E. Coli., Enterobacter A. It did not show any activity against Citrobacter F., Proteus M., Klebsiella P. Storage conditions (27 degrees C, glass flask) did not affect antibacterial properties of the extract.
TI  - Effect of urinary tract infection on disintegration of calcium-containing stones.
AB  - To evaluate the possible effect of urinary tract infection (UTI) on the fragility of calcium-containing stones (calcium-oxalate, calcium-phosphate), the results of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) therapy in 81 patients with UTI and 30 patients with no sign of UTI were comparatively evaluated. ESWL parameters (shock wave number, kilovolt value, treatment time) and stone-free status during 3 and 6 months of follow-up were assessed for each patient, and the results were evaluated with respect to stone presence. Our results indicated that the presence of UTI may decrease stone fragility and increase stone clearance time. We believe that deterioration of peristaltic dynamics in the renal pelvis and the ureteral wall may reveal prolonged stone clearance phases in such patients.
TI  - Inhibition of mouse liver cytochrome P-450 by gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The ability of bacterial endotoxins, of different origin, to modify the level of  mouse liver cytochrome P-450 was investigated. Endotoxins, (lipopolysaccharides, LPSs) were isolated from Proteus, Escherichia, Salmonella, Bacteroides and Coxiella strains. The most potent inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 activity was S. typhi 0101 LPS, which at a dose of 1 microgram/mouse reduced the cytochrome P-450 activity to 59%. E. coli O55:B5, S. typhimurium, P. mirabilis O3, and C. burnetii LPSs, at dose 10 micrograms/mouse, decrease cytochrome P-450 level from 56 to 69%. B. ovatus LPS significantly suppressed the expression of cytochrome P-450 only at the highest dose used-100 micrograms/mouse. The comparison of inhibitory activity of P. mirabilis complete, S and R types of LPSs indicate that lipid A portion of LPSs are sufficient to decrease the cytochrome P-450 level. However, the core oligosaccharide of LPS significantly enhance that inhibition. The isolated O-specific polysaccharide part of P. mirabilis O3 LPS did not decrease cytochrome P-450 level. The comparison of biological activity of Proteus LPSs, tested by chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test, demonstrated the enhancement effect of O-polysaccharide part of tested LPSs.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Synthesis and secretion of recombinant penicillin G acylase in bacterial L-forms.
AB  - L-form strains of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli lacking the cell wall represent an alternative prokaryotic cell system for the production of recombinant proteins (KLESSEN et al. 1988, LAPLACE et al. 1988a, 1989b). We could demonstrate that they are also able to synthesize the enzyme penicillin G acylase (PAC)1). PAC was processed and secreted into the medium by recombinant L-form strains. The synthesis of PAC was growth-associated and stably regulated. Expression, secretion, and processing were not temperature-dependent and occurred at 26 degrees C, 32 degrees C and even 37 degrees C. The expression vector pHC1 carried the pac gene under the control of the lac UV promotor and a kanamycin resistance gene. It could be maintained in L-form cells, showing low structural as well as segregational instability. The secretion of the biologically active enzyme into the medium indicated that the postranslational processing of the PAC molecule, including the excision of a 54 amino acid spacer peptide between the alpha and beta subunit, is not carried out in the periplasmic space, but occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane or autocatalytically.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in adolescent boys.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory features of 21 adolescent males with urinary tract infections were studied. Sixty-seven percent were symptomatic and 80% revealed abnormalities on initial urinalysis. Forty-eight percent showed structural anomalies of the urinary tract. Recurrences were observed only in those having abnormalities of the urinary tract.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the genes encoding the hemolysin of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We previously identified a heat- and protease-labile haemolytic activity expressed by Haemophilus ducreyi. In order to characterize the haemolysin at the molecular level, genomic DNA from H. ducreyi was probed with haemolysin genes from other Gram-negative organisms. The haemolysin genes of Proteus mirabilis hybridized to H. ducreyi DNA suggesting that the haemolysin of H. ducreyi is related to the Proteus/Serratia pore-forming family of haemolysins. Tn916 mutagenesis was employed to isolate haemolysin-deficient mutants. Approximately 5000 Tn916 transposon mutants were screened for the loss of haemolytic activity and two mutants were identified. One mutant, designated 35,000-1, was further characterized. Sequences flanking the Tn916 element in strain 35,000-1 were employed to identify clones from a lambda DASHII library of H. ducreyi strain 35,000 DNA. A 13 kb insert from one lambda clone was selected for further study. This 13 kb fragment was able to both confer haemolytic activity to Escherichia coli and complement the haemolysin deficiency in strain 35,000-1. The haemolysin gene cluster was cloned from this 13 kb insert and two genes, designated hhdA and hhdB, were identified. The derived amino acid sequence of these genes demonstrated homology to the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of P. mirabilis and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1993 to May 1994 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to chloramphenicol decreased. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to minocycline (MINO) decreased in complicated UTIs. As for Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. Against E. coli, the activities of cefotiam decreased in complicated UTIs, and aminoglycosides decreased. As for Klebsiella spp., susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except aminoglycosides and MINO were good. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter increased, but susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of Serratia spp. to MINO has decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - Isolation and sequence analysis of rpoH genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mRNA and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  - The rpoH genes encoding homologs of Escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): Enterobacter cloacae (gamma), Serratia marcescens (gamma), Proteus mirabilis (gamma), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and Zymomonas mobilis (alpha). Comparison of these and three known genes from E.coli (gamma), Citrobacter freundii (gamma) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. Both the sequence complementary to part of 16S rRNA (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mRNA secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in E.coli were found for the rpoH genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. Moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues Q(R/K)(K/R)LFFNLR, designated the 'RpoH box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in DnaK/DnaJ chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. In addition, a putative sigma E (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoH genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. These results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in E.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.
TI  - [Value of media containing chromogenic substrates for the identification and the  listing of urinary bacteria].
AB  - Performance in terms of enumeration, growth and identification with a new culture medium (CPS ID2, bioMerieux) was evaluated using 405 urine samples and 244 collection strains. The CPS ID2 medium contains chromogenic substrates enabling the detection of 4 bacterial enzymes which leads to the identification of colonies: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus-Morganella-Providencia and enterococci. No discrepancies in the enumeration were observed with the collected strains and urine samples. Sensibility and specificity of the identification of Proteae taxa (TDA +) and enterococcal taxa (Gram positive cocci and beta-glucosidase +) was 100% using urine samples and 95.1% of E. coli strains (beta-glucuronidase +, indole +) are detected. Routine use of this new medium for the bacterial examination of urine is satisfactory and an ultra-violet lamp is no longer required for reading as was the case previously with media containing fluorogenic substrates.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1992). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June 1992 to May 1993 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs to quinolones has decreased. As for S. aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. E. coli, all strains were highly susceptibilities to latamoxef and cefozopran. And the susceptibilities of E. coli isolated from uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter to minocycline has decreased in 1991, but they has been indicated a trend of recovery in 1992. The difference in according UTI's classification of the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. to minocycline in 1991 has not recognized in 1992. And the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. isolated from complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter to quinolones has decreased. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs to quinolones has been indicated a trend of recovery. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1992). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 732 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1992 to May 1993.

TI  - Inhibition of growth of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in urine in response to fasting and vegetarian diet.
AB  - It has recently been shown that serum antibody levels against Proteus mirabilis decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who improved clinically during treatment with 7-10 days of fasting followed by a one-year vegetarian diet. As P. mirabilis is commonly implicated in urinary tract infections, this study was carried out to examine whether fasting and vegetarian diet may influence the growth of P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli in urine. Urine samples were collected from 22 patients who were referred to a health farm for various reasons. The dietary regimen recommended by the health farm consisted of fasting for 7 to 10 days followed by a vegan diet. The growth of both bacteria in urine samples collected after 8 days was significantly slower than in samples collected at baseline. In urine samples collected after 18 days growth was also reduced, although not significantly for E. coli. Our results show that dietary manipulation may reduce the ability of urine to support the growth of P. mirabilis and E. coli.
TI  - In-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  - Driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation or suspension of driving privileges. The accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. Under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of DUI. In this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. Samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees C for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. Ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. Results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. The rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees C or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. Many of these species were also able to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by fermentation.
TI  - Characterization of the hemolytic activity of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - H. ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease most prevalent in developing countries. Chancroid enhances the heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and is identified in focal outbreaks in the United States, but little is known about its pathogenesis. We studied the hemolysin produced by H. ducreyi because this molecule might be an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of chancroid. Ten strains of H. ducreyi were tested on newly devised blood agar plates and were found to have hemolytic activity. We examined the hemolytic activity of H. ducreyi 35000 further and found that it was heat labile, cell associated, greatest at pH 7.0, and produced in logarithmic- but not stationary-phase cultures. Using transposons Tn916 and Tn1545-delta 3, we have isolated three classes of transposon mutants of strain 35000: those with no detectable hemolytic activity, those with reduced hemolytic activity, and those with enhanced hemolytic activity. Transposon insertions in the nonhemolytic mutants were located in a DNA sequence which hybridized to the Proteus mirabilis hemolysin gene. Analysis of clones containing overlapping sections of this region served to further localize the H. ducreyi hemolysin gene and allow its expression in Escherichia coli and complementation of the nonhemolytic defect in an H. ducreyi mutant. These experiments indicate that H. ducreyi 35000 produces a hemolysin that is related to the calcium-independent hemolysin produced by P. mirabilis. Further experiments are needed to define the similarity of the H. ducreyi hemolysin to other calcium-independent hemolysins and to determine its role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.
TI  - The effect of iontophoresis on bacterial growth in urine.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of iontophoresis (electrical current for therapeutic purposes) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in human urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated and inoculated into a dynamic in vitro artificial bladder model. Pooled sterile human urine was regulated through the artificial bladder by intravenous tubing and pumps to simulate filling and emptying of the human bladder. The effect of electrical current on bacterial growth in the system was then studied. RESULTS: When iontophoresis is applied at low bacterial concentrations ( < 10(8) colony forming units [CFU]/l.), inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. However, when iontophoresis is applied after fulminant growth of bacteria ( > 10(8) CFU/l.), no inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. Iontophoresis was not found to enhance the antibacterial action of gentamicin to resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Iontophoresis inhibits bacterial growth at low bacterial concentrations. It does not inhibit bacterial growth after infectious levels have been attained, and it does not potentiate the action of gentamicin on resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Elevation in anti-Proteus antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from Bermuda and England.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from Bermuda and England have an increased anti-Proteus antibody titer when compared to healthy Bermudian and English controls, and to ascertain whether any increase in antibody titer is specific by testing 4 other microbes, Escherichia coli and 3 normal anaerobic bowel bacteria. METHODS: Antibody titers were measured by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) under coded conditions. RESULTS: Elevated titers of anti-Proteus antibodies were demonstrated in 34 patients with active RA from Bermuda when compared to 33 healthy Bermudian controls by ELISA (p < 0.001) and IIFA (p < 0.001). An elevation of anti-Proteus antibodies was also observed in 34 patients with RA from England when compared to 30 healthy English controls again by ELISA (p < 0.001). A similar antibody elevation in 31 patients with RA from England was observed when compared to 30 healthy controls when measured by IIFA (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant elevation in antibody titers against E. coli or the 3 normal bowel flora isolates in the patients with RA from both countries compared to their respective controls, when measured by ELISA. CONCLUSION: A specific elevation in the immune response to Proteus mirabilis has been demonstrated in patients with RA from both Bermuda and England. However, this study cannot distinguish between antibody association with disease per se and association with disease activity. The role of Proteus in RA and the effect of anti-Proteus therapy in patients with RA merits further study.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Expression of flagella and motility by Shigella.
AB  - Since the discovery of Shigella as the aetiologic agent of acute dysentery almost 100 years ago, this organism has been described as a non-motile and nonflagellated organism that invades the human colonic mucosa. In this study, the production of flagella by prototypic strains of all four Shigella species and, moreover, by fresh clinical isolates was demonstrated by electron microscopy. The flagellum of Shigella (flash) is approximately 10 microns long and 12-14 nm in diameter and is typically seen emanating from one pole of the bacterium. Flash is composed of a putative structural polypeptide subunit of 33-38 kDa that shares immunological similarities with Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Proteus mirabilis flagellins, and with the recently described recombinant Shigella flagellins (FliCSS and FliCSF) expressed in E. coli K-12. A fliCSS-specific oligo probe hybridized with all four Shigella species, while a fliCSF probe hybridized with all Shigella flexneri and Shigella dysenteriae strains, but not with all Shigella sonnei or Shigella boydii strains, indicating genetic divergence among their flagellin genes. Shigella exhibits motility in low-concentration motility agar under physiological growth conditions. The expression of flash and motility appears to be strictly regulated by unidentified genetic and environmental factors. These heretofore undescribed features may allow the bacteria to circumvent the natural intestinal mucosal defences leading to bacterial colonization and disease. The motility of shigellae may represent an evolutionary adaptation important for bacterial survival.
TI  - Turkey rhinotracheitis virus isolated from broiler chicken with swollen head syndrome in Japan.
AB  - Turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) virus was first isolated from a commercial broiler chicken with swollen head syndrome (SHS) in Japan. At the same time, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian reovirus (ARV), Escherichia coli (E.coli), Morganella morganii, and Proteus mirabilis were also isolated from the same broiler chicken. The presence of antibodies to TRT virus was confirmed in the sera of 34-day-old chickens of the flock with SHS, however the antibodies to TRT virus were undetectable in the sera of 17-day-old chickens. In this investigation, we confirmed avian pneumovirus infection in chickens in Japan, and the virus and other agents may be considered as a cause of SHS.
TI  - Plasma and urine disposition and dose proportionality of ceftiofur and metabolites in dogs after subcutaneous administration of ceftiofur sodium.
AB  - Nine male dogs (10.3-13.5 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to three groups  of three dogs each and administered ceftiofur sodium subcutaneously as a single dose of 0.22, 2.2, or 4.4 mg ceftiofur free acid equivalents/kg body weight. Plasma and urine samples were collected serially for 72 h and assayed for ceftiofur and metabolites (derivatized to desfuroylceftiofur acetamide) using high-performance liquid chromatography. Urine concentrations remained above the MIC90 for Escherichia coli (4.0 micrograms/mL) and Proteus mirabilis (1.0 micrograms/mL) for over 24 h after doses of 2.2 mg/kg (8.1 micrograms/mL) and 4.4 mg/kg (29.6 micrograms/mL), the interval between treatments for ceftiofur sodium in dogs, whereas urine concentrations 24 h after dosing at 0.22 mg/kg (0.1 mg/Ib) were below the MIC90 for E. coli and P. mirabilis (0.6 microgram/mL). Plasma concentrations were dose-proportional, with peak concentrations of 1.66 +/- 0.0990 micrograms/mL, 8.91 +/- 6.42 micrograms/mL, and 26.7 +/- 1.07 micrograms/mL after doses of 0.22, 2.2, and 4.4 mg/kg, respectively. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, when normalized to dose, was similar across all dosage groups.

AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June 1991 to May 1992 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to cefmenoxime and amikacin has decreased. As for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990 and 1991, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. The susceptibilities of E. coli to minocycline was observed a very clear alteration, that is, in uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, the susceptibilities has decreased. However, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. was not observed an obvious variation. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from uncomplicated UTIs has clearly decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.

TI  - Urinary tract infections and cholelithiasis in early childhood.
AB  
TI  - Proteus mirabilis amino acid deaminase: cloning, nucleotide sequence, and characterization of aad.
AB  - Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella species produce deaminases that generate alpha-keto acids from amino acids. The alpha-keto acid products are detected by the formation of colored iron complexes, raising the possibility that the enzyme functions to secure iron for these species, which do not produce traditional siderophores. A gene encoding an amino acid deaminase of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis was identified by screening a genomic library hosted in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha for amino acid deaminase activity. The deaminase gene, localized on a cosmid clone by subcloning and Tn5::751 mutagenesis, was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. A single open reading frame, designated aad (amino acid deaminase), which appears to be both necessary and sufficient for deaminase activity, predicts a 473-amino-acid polypeptide (51,151 Da) encoded within an area mapped by transposon mutagenesis. The predicted amino acid sequence of Aad did not share significant amino acid sequence similarity with any other polypeptide in the PIR or SwissProt database. Amino acid deaminase activity in both P. mirabilis and E. coli transformed with aad-encoding plasmids was not affected by medium iron concentration or expression of genes in multicopy in fur, cya, or crp E. coli backgrounds. Enzyme expression was negatively affected by growth with glucose or glycerol as the sole carbon source but was not consistent with catabolite repression.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a metalloprotease from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is known for its ability to differentiate from swimmer to swarmer cells, a process crucial for the pathogenesis of these bacteria during urinary tract infections. Among the many virulence factors produced during swarmer cell differentiation is an extracellular metalloprotease. A cosmid containing a large fragment of P. mirabilis chromosomal DNA was obtained by measuring protease expression in recombinant Escherichia coli. The recombinant and native enzymes were purified to over 95% homogeneity from culture supernatants by use of phenyl-Sepharose affinity chromatography and found to be identical. The activity of the 55-kDa enzyme was stimulated by divalent cations (Ca2+ > Mg2+) and inhibited by a chelator of these cations. The enzyme possesses substrate specificity for both serum and secretory forms of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) and IgA2 as well as IgG and, unlike classic IgA proteases, digested to completion both human and mouse IgA. Following subcloning, a 5-kb DNA fragment encoding recombinant protease activity was identified by insertional mutagenesis with Tn5. Four open reading frames were identified within this 5-kb region by limited nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA flanking the transposon. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the metalloprotease structural gene (zapA) were obtained. Computerized homology studies revealed that the P. mirabilis metalloprotein is a member of the serralysin family of proteases and may be part of an operon comprising genes encoding an ATP-dependent ABC transporter in addition to the metalloprotease. The relevance of the metalloprotease to swarmer cell differentiation and pathogenicity is discussed.
TI  - Retrograde transmission of Proteus mirabilis during platelet transfusion and the  use of arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction for bacteria typing in suspected cases of transfusion transmission of infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: When bacteria are found, after a platelet transfusion, in the recipient's blood as well as in the platelet concentrate (PC), a causal relationship is normally suspected, with the PC as the causative agent. The other alternative, that the patient has bacteremia and contaminated the PC, is less well documented in the literature. CASE REPORT: Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) was used for testing strains of Proteus mirabilis isolated from a patient's blood before and after a platelet transfusion and from the PC. Because of a febrile reaction after a platelet transfusion, bacterial culture was performed on the PC used, showing growth of P. mirabilis. The same species was found in the patient's blood after the transfusion. Posttransfusion sepsis caused by a contaminated PC was suspected, and anti-sepsis treatment was given to the recipient. Later, it became apparent that the patient had had bacteremia before the transfusion and that P. mirabilis was one of the species in the isolate. With AP-PCR, the identity of the three P. mirabilis isolates could be distinguished. CONCLUSION: AP-PCR is a useful technique for distinguishing the identity of bacterial isolates from patients and blood components. A patient with bacteremia can contaminate a PC in conjunction with a platelet transfusion. With AP-PCR, the PC could be ruled out as the cause of the posttransfusion sepsis.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis urease: operon fusion and linker insertion analysis of ure gene organization, regulation, and function.
AB  - Urease is an inducible virulence factor of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis. Although eight contiguous genes necessary for urease activity have been cloned and sequenced, the transcriptional organization and regulation of specific genes within the Proteus gene cluster has not been investigated in detail. The first gene, ureR, is located 400 bp upstream and is oriented in the direction opposite the other seven genes, ureDABCEFG. The structural subunits of urease are encoded by ureABC. Previously, UreR was shown to contain a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif 30 residues upstream of a consensus sequence which is a signature for the AraC family of positive regulators; this polypeptide is homologous to other DNA-binding regulatory proteins. Nested deletions of ureR linked to either ureD-lacZ or ureA-lacZ operon fusions demonstrated that an intact ureR is required for urea-induced synthesis of LacZ from either ureA or ureD and identified a urea-regulated promoter in the ureR-ureD intergenic region. However, lacZ operon fusions to fragments encompassing putative promoter regions upstream of ureA and ureF demonstrated that no urea-regulated promoters occur upstream of these open reading frames; regions upstream of ureR, ureE, and ureG were not tested. These data suggest that UreR acts as a positive regulator in the presence of urea, activating transcription of urease structural and accessory genes via sequences upstream of ureD. To address the role of the nonstructural regulatory and accessory genes, we constructed deletion, cassette, and linker insertion mutations throughout the ure gene cluster and determined the effect of these mutations on production and regulation of urease activity in Escherichia coli. Mutations were obtained, with locations determine by DNA sequencing, in all genes except ureA and ureE. In each case, the mutation resulted in a urease-negative phenotype.
TI  - Survival of enterobacteria in liquid cultures during microwave radiation and conventional heating.
AB  - Bacteria in food have been reported to survive in larger numbers after processing by microwave radiation than after conventional processing. The bactericidal effect of a domestic microwave oven (SHARP R-7280) on certain pathogenic enterobacteria species was investigated in vitro, in comparison with conventional heating (boiling). The death rates of different nosocomial strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sofia, Salmonella enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. The microwave oven and the conventional heating system used were both calibrated in order to calculate temperatures from exposure times. For each strain duplicate samples of 25 ml of pure culture with concentrations at least 10(6) cfu/ml were exposed to microwave radiation. An equal number of samples of the same volume and concentration were exposed to conventional heating. Subsequently all samples were examined qualitatively and quantitatively following standard microbiological procedures. The results indicate that microwaves have an efficient bactericidal effect on the enterobacteria in liquid cultures.
TI  - Exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane by dissociation of calcium-dependent  junctional complex augments endocytosis of enteric bacteria.
AB  - Intestinal bacterial translocation is facilitated in a variety of clinical conditions involving increased intestinal permeability, such as shock and trauma. Because there is both in vivo and in vitro evidence that enteric bacteria can be internalized by intestinal epithelial cells, experiments were designed to test the effect of increased intestinal permeability on enterocyte endocytosis of enteric bacteria. Mature, confluent cultures of HT-29 enterocytes were placed in a calcium-free solution for 1 h. Enterocyte viability was not noticeably altered, but transepithelial electrical resistance was significantly decreased (indicating a decrease in epithelial junctional integrity), and the enterocytes were pulled apart. Electron microscopic observations revealed enteric bacteria preferentially adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface, and the numbers of viable enteric bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis) internalized by these enterocytes were significantly increased. Restoration of calcium restored confluency to enterocyte cultures, and bacterial internalization reverted to control levels. Thus, calcium-dependent junctional integrity might play a role in augmenting bacterial translocation in clinical conditions associated with increased intestinal permeability.
TI  - The detection of raised levels of IgM to Proteus mirabilis in sera from patients  with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - An analysis by ELISA of 100 rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive sera selected at random from a collection of sera from patients with various auto-immune diseases and joint pains, and 100 RF-negative sera from the same collection matched by patient age and gender, showed that the RF-positive sera had highly significantly (p < 0.0001) raised levels of IgM antibody, but not IgG antibody, to Proteus mirabilis over those of the RF-negative sera. This response was subsequently found to be associated with sera from patients who clinically had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Sera from the RA patients had significantly greater amounts (p = 0.026) of IgM antibody to P. mirabilis than to the other organisms tested and these values were also highly significantly different (p < 0.0001) from P. mirabilis IgM antibody levels in matched RF-negative sera. Sera from RA patients also had significantly greater amounts of IgA to P. mirabilis (p < 0.0001) and greater amounts of IgM to Escherichia coli (p < 0.0001) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p < 0.0001) than those in matched RF-negative sera. Other classes of antibody to these organisms and all classes of antibody to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not raised in the sera of RA patients over those of RF-negative controls. The IgM response in RA patients was not specific for only one O serotype of P. mirabilis but was associated with all 11 different O serotypes of P. mirabilis tested and those of other Proteus spp. Moreover, the IgM antibodies to Proteus spp. appeared to be independent from C-reactive protein and RF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Intra-uterine infection in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes: maternal and neonatal characteristics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of intra-uterine infection in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes and to evaluate the clinical characteristics of women and neonates according to the presence or absence of intrauterine infection. STUDY DESIGN: Trans-abdominal amniocentesis was performed in 90 consecutive patients admitted with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Maternal clinical parameters evaluated included maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, previous preterm birth, urinary tract infection, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval and cesarean rate. Neonatal clinical parameters evaluated were gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar score, neonatal gender, perinatal death and neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: The prevalence of intra-uterine infection was 66.6% (60/90). No differences between patients with intra-uterine infection and those without intra-uterine infection were observed in maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval, cesarean section, neonate's gender, Apgar score at 5 min and neonatal sepsis. On the other hand, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and Apgar score at 1 min were significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: An intra-uterine infection was found in two thirds of women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes and intra-uterine infection had a lower gestational age at delivery and consequently had a lower neonatal birth weight than those without intra-uterine infection.

AB  - Susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1989 to May 1990 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. As for Citrobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. As for Enterobacter spp., the susceptible strains to flomoxef, cefixime, cefuzonam and ceftazidime increased in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. coli to penicillins increased slightly in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. Against Klebsiella spp., a good activity of minocycline or cephems was found. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin and new quinolones increased in uncomplicated UTIs. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.

TI  - Conserved amino acid residues in the primary structure of ribosomal protein S20 from selected gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Partial DNA sequences encoding ribosomal protein S20 have been determined for a number of Gram-negative bacteria including three species of Aeromonas, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium and compared to the known sequence from Escherichia coli. The derived amino acid sequence is well conserved, particularly in the C-terminal one-third of S20. In contrast, there is much less conservation of the nucleotide sequence or potential secondary structure in the corresponding mRNA.
TI  - Determination of muramic acid in organic dust by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - A method is described for the quantitation of muramic acid, a marker of bacterial peptidoglycan, in organic dust. House dust samples were hydrolysed in hydrochloric acid and then extracted with hexane to remove hydrophobic compounds. The aqueous phase was evaporated, heated in a silylation reagent to form trimethylsilyl derivatives, and analysed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. The muramic acid derivative gave two peaks upon injection into the gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer. Injection of 10 pg of the derivative gave a signal-to-noise ratio of 17 for the dominating peak when using selected ion monitoring in the electron impact mode, and a linear calibration curve was achieved upon analysis of samples containing 5-1500 ng of muramic acid. In a house dust sample, 40 ng of muramic acid was found per mg of dust; the coefficient of variation was 8.2% (n = 6, 1.2 mg of dust analysed). The described method is rapid and simple to apply, and should therefore become widely used for measuring peptidoglycan in many types of environmental samples, including organic dust.
TI  - Inhibitory action of metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - Fifty clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against S. infantis, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. The pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. Pyocyanin, the major metabolite of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit Escherichia coli, Proteus spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of P. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. However, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of P. aeruginosa against a large number of clinical isolates such as Escherichia spp., Klebsiella spp., and Salmonella spp., up to now. For this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of E. coli, 30 of K. pneumoniae, 30 of S. infantis, 6 of Enterobacter cloacae and 9 of Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Characteristics of ulcers of the small bowel induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the rat: implications for clinical practice.
AB  - Small bowel ulcers were created in the rat after the oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Of the six NSAIDs tested, indomethacin and diclofenac alone were associated with such damage which did not occur in a simple dose-related fashion. Bacteria were observed by electron microscopy in an active state of division in the base of the ulcers. When grown aerobically these were shown to be strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Anatomically, NSAID-induced ulcers were found throughout the length of the bowel although more abundant in the proximal half. In vivo and in vitro sensitivity to antibiotics suggested that in addition to the bacteria identified, anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing organisms also have an important role in ulcer production in this model. This rat model of NSAID-induced gut toxicity is discussed in relation to the human situation, particularly for patients who take NSAIDs and who have an iron-deficiency anaemia and blood in their faeces, but no lesions in either the upper or lower bowel.
TI  - Buffering capacity and H+ membrane conductance of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Buffering capacity and membrane H+ conductance were examined in seven Gram-negative species: Aquaspirillum serpens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Aeromonas hydrophila. All strains of Enterobacteriaceae studied here showed a decrease in both parameters as the external pH increased, over the pH range studied. The other four species presented an increase in buffering capacity and membrane conductance to protons as the external pH increased from 5.5 to 7.0.
TI  - Studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  - This study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. These include 56 paucibacillary (PB) and 73 multibacillary (MB) cases. Thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. The non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically PB leprosy (TT/BT/I) patients were: (1) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus(1), Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus subtilis(1), Corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(1), Proteus mirabilis(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). The isolates from clinically MB leprosy (BB/BL/LL) patients were: (a) Gram-positive cocci: Micrococci(1), Staphylococcus aureus(1) and Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1); Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1). (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Proteus mirabilis(2). The specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. These were (a) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus albus(2), Staphylococcus aureus(2) and Micrococci(2); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1), Bacillus subtilis(2), Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(3), Proteus vulgaris(1) and Proteus mirabilis(1). While these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and PB/MB types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out subtypes if any.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - Enhancement of uptake of lipopolysaccharide in macrophages by the major outer membrane protein OmpA of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to the major outer membrane protein OmpA from Proteus mirabilis were generated and used to monitor the kinetics of uptake in macrophages of LPS as well as LPS bound to OmpA. Uptake was measured by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a microtiter culture system. The MAb were of various immunoglobulin G subclasses and showed strong reactivities with their antigens. Four hybridoma clones recognizing LPS and three recognizing OmpA from P. mirabilis 19 were selected for the present study on the basis of reactions in ELISA and Western blot (immunoblot) analyses. In the uptake assay, it was possible to differentiate between antigen on the cell surface and antigen which had been internalized. Uptake of LPS by macrophages was relatively rapid during the first 4 h of culture and then progressed more slowly over the remaining 24-h observation period. The level of detection of LPS in this assay system was in the nanogram range. When macrophages were pulsed with LPS for 30 min and subsequently washed to remove antigen not bound to the cells, the amount of LPS detectable on the macrophage surface decreased progressively for 3 h after the pulse, which indicated internalization of the antigen. Thereafter, LPS rose to an increased level on the cell surface. The rate of uptake of LPS was more rapid when it was in complex with OmpA. When the fate of OmpA was monitored in the same LPS-protein complexes by use of MAb to OmpA in a pulse experiment, the level of protein measured on the cell surface decreased after an initial rise, which again indicated internalization, but the protein did not reappear on the cell surface in a form detectable with the MAb. Compared with the LPS monitoring system, detection of OmpA associated with macrophages was weak, although the MAb to OmpA reacted strongly with the protein in the ELISA and Western blot analyses.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Two hundred and three patients with skin and skin structure infections were treated with isepamicin once daily or amikacin twice daily in an open, randomised, comparative multicentre trial. Patients were randomised to treatment with isepamicin or amikacin in a 2:1 ratio. Severe infections (63 patients) were treated with isepamicin 15 mg/kg once daily (n = 15) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n - 18), less severe infections (140 patients) with isepamicin 8 mg/kg once daily (n = 93) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n = 47). The overall clinical response rate at the end of treatment was excellent in all treatment groups (94-96% cured or improved) with no significant differences between isepamicin and amikacin in patients with either server or less severe infections. The most commonly isolated target pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Overall, in patients who had a valid target pathogen isolated prior to treatment and who met other evaluability criteria, bacteriological eradication was achieved in over 90% of patients; amikacin patients with severe infections had a somewhat lower eradication rate (82%). Over all infections, 4/110 (4%) patients in the isepamicin group and 5/54 (9%) patients in the amikacin had organisms which persisted. Adverse events were reported in 12% of patients in the isepamicin group and 6% in the amikacin group. The most frequently reported adverse event in the isepamicin group as headache. Two patients (one in each treatment group), both of whom experienced skin rashes, were withdrawn. Potentially clinically significant changes in serum creatinine occurred in two patients, who received isepamicin and one who received amikacin (who was withdrawn from the study). Ototoxicity was rare, occurring in one patient treated with isepamicin.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences of two fimbrial major subunit genes, pmpA and ucaA, from canine-uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis strains were isolated from dogs with urinary tract infection (UTI) and fimbriae were prepared from two strains. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the major fimbrial subunits were determined and both sequences appeared identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a urinary cell adhesin (UCA) (Wray, S. K., Hull, S. I., Cook, R. G., Barrish, J. & Hull, R. A., 1986, Infect Immun 54, 43-49). The genes of two different major fimbrial subunits were cloned using oligonucleotide probes that were designed on the basis of the N-terminal UCA sequence. Nucleotide sequencing revealed the complete ucaA gene of 540 bp (from strain IVB247) encoding a polypeptide of 180 amino acids, including a 22 amino acid signal sequence peptide, and the pmpA (P. mirabilis P-like pili) gene of 549 bp (from strain IVB219) encoding a polypeptide of 183 amino acids, including a 23 amino acid signal sequence. Hybridization experiments gave clear indications of the presence of both kinds of fimbriae in many UTI-related canine P. mirabilis isolates. However, the presence of these fimbriae could not be demonstrated in P. vulgaris or other Proteus-related species. Database analysis of amino acid sequences of major subunit proteins revealed that the UcaA protein shares about 56% amino acid identity with the F17A and F111A major fimbrial subunits from bovine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. In turn, the PmpA protein more closely resembled the pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap)-like major subunit protein from UTI-related E. coli. The evolutionary relationship of UcaA, PmpA and various other fimbrial subunit proteins is presented in a phylogenetic tree.
TI  - Experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  - The immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator Urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. The preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. It consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: Escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, Rc mutant of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis, BALB/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with Urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. A stimulatory effect of Urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. An increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. Lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. At the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. An active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by Gram-negative bacteria was obtained. In conclusion, the results obtained characterize Urostim as an effective immunostimulator. Its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Crystal structure of catalase HPII from Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Catalase is a ubiquitous enzyme present in both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of aerobic organisms. It serves, in part, to protect the cell from the toxic effects of small peroxides. Escherichia coli produces two catalases, HPI and HPII, that are quite distinct from other catalases in physical structure and catalytic properties. HPII, studied in this work, is encoded by the katE gene, and has been characterized as an oligomeric, monofunctional catalase containing one cis-heme d prosthetic group per subunit of 753 residues. RESULTS: The crystal structure of catalase HPII from E. coli has been determined to 2.8 A resolution. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a whole molecule, which is a tetramer with accurate 222 point group symmetry. In the model built, that includes residues 27-753 and one heme group per monomer, strict non-crystallographic symmetry has been maintained. The crystallographic agreement R-factor is 20.1% for 58,477 reflections in the resolution shell 8.0-2.8 A. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in size and chemical properties, which were suggestive of a unique catalase, the deduced structure of HPII is related to the structure of catalase from Penicillium vitale, whose sequence is not yet known. In particular, both molecules have an additional C-terminal domain that is absent in the bovine catalase. This extra domain contains a Rossmann fold but no bound nucleotides have been detected, and its physiological role is unknown. In HPII, the heme group is modified to a heme d and inverted with respect to the orientation determined in all previously reported heme catalases. HPII is the largest catalase for which the structure has been determined to almost atomic resolution.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in the sera of ankylosing spondylitis patients with/without iritis and enthesitis.
AB  - IgM, IgG and IgA class serum antibodies against the whole Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against K. pneumoniae and E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were studied earlier in the sera of 98 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. In this study the patients were divided into groups according to the clinical picture, i.e. presence or absence of iritis and enthesitis. The previous major finding of increased IgA class antibody levels against the whole K. pneumoniae bacteria in AS patients when compared to the healthy controls was not specifically associated with any single patient group in the present study. However, the patients with iritis had higher levels of IgA class antibodies to LPS of K. pneumoniae and E. coli when compared to the patients without iritis. In addition, the patients without enthesitis had higher level of IgG class antibodies against whole K. pneumoniae bacteria compared to the patients with enthesitis. The increased IgA class antibody levels against K. pneumoniae and E. coli LPS in AS patients with iritis may reflect an inflammatory process in the gut area. Furthermore, there were certain other differences in the immunological parameters between the AS patients with and without iritis or enthesitis and the possibility that they reflect different mechanisms involved in the disease processes cannot be excluded.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in the sera of patients with axial and peripheral form of ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - IgM, IgG and IgA class serum antibodies against the whole Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against K. pneumoniae and E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were studied earlier in two separate patient populations of 99 and 85 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. In this study the patients were divided into groups according to the presence or absence of peripheral arthritis. The patients with peripheral type AS had increased levels of IgM and IgA class antibodies against K. pneumoniae, whereas the patients with axial type AS had increased levels of IgG and IgA class antibodies to K. pneumoniae, as well as IgA class antibodies against E. coli and P. mirabilis bacteria. Sulphasalazine treatment decreased the IgM and IgA class antibodies in peripheral AS and IgA class antibodies in axial AS against K. pneumoniae LPS. The antibody levels were also decreased against E. coli and P. mirabilis bacteria in the sera of patients with axial AS. The immunological findings in patients with peripheral and axial form of AS were different from each other and thus may reflect different aetiopathogenetic mechanisms for these two types of AS.
TI  - Molecular cloning of Proteus mirabilis uroepithelial cell adherence (uca) genes.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis bacteria are a common cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract  infection. In a previous study, we described a P. mirabilis fimbrial protein, UCA, that adhered to human uroepithelial cells. Genes sufficient for expression of UCA adherence were cloned into Escherichia coli K-12. E. coli bacteria that contained the uca recombinant plasmid adhered to human uroepithelial cells. In addition, the ucaA gene encoding the structural component of UCA pili was subcloned, and its DNA sequence was determined. Amino acid sequence homology (30 to 50%) was found between mature UcaA protein and pilins from pathogenic bacteria representing several genera, including E. coli F17, G, and type 1C pilins, Haemophilus M43 pilin, and a Bordetella pilin.
TI  - Effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by Escherichia coli and Proteus, Providencia, and Pseudomonas spp.
AB  - Osmotic stress, salicylate, and Mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the OmpF porin. Since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of P and CFA fimbriae in Escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. Hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in E. coli (C. Li, C. J. Louise, W. Shi, and J. Adler, J. Bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). In the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. Swarming did not occur at 20 mM sodium salicylate. Salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in E. coli. Phenotypic Mar mutants of E. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. Flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when P. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mM salicylate. Salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kDa porin protein in P. mirabilis. This finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on Proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the Proteus porin may not be analogous to OmpF in E. coli. Salicylate decreased the motility of Pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - The role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  - This study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive surgical infections. A dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. Therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. It was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. Therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. The times above the MIC in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: Escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; Haemophilus spp., 12 h; Proteus mirabilis, 12 h; Klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; Providencia spp., 9.2 h; Clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; Peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all S. aureus, 6.8 h. From the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the Gram-negative anaerobes. For those infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  - Using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. The bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Rhodococcus equi (n = 4), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and Escherichia coli (n = 3). In addition, two isolates of Enterobacter spp. and one isolate of Streptococcus equisimilis, Staphylococcus intermedius, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens were examined. For determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were fixed as limiting values: Trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. As expected, Rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. However, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. According to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.
TI  - [Phenotypes of resistance to antibiotics of the most frequently isolated strains  in five specialized hospital centers. Multicenter study].
AB  - Antibiotic susceptibility of 948 bacterial strains isolated from varied samples essentially proceeding from urinary infections in five Paris psychiatric Hospitals was determined by disk diffusion method. E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa et S. aureus are the predominant bacteria. 40% of S. aureus are methicilline resistant. Enterobacteriaceae are progressively becoming resistant to aminopenicillines, but remain sensitive to third generation cephalosporines. They are still susceptible to first generation quinolones. At least, if no resistance of P. aeruginosa to imipeneme has been reported, 30% of strains are resistant to ciprofloxacine. Resistance phenotypes to antibiotics of the strains isolated in patients from psychiatric Hospitals are located between those observed in out patients and in patients from general Hospitals. However, we noticed a worrying evolution of resistance to those encontered in psychiatric Hospitals. Therefore, a multiresistant strains emergence monitoring must be carried out regulary.
TI  - Development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. Prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  - Wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. Over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. Seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. Seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. Forty of 63 (64%) infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (17%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. Only 7 of 42 (17%) noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only S aureus, S epidermidis and Corynebacterium species isolated. Ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. Rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. Emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. Therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Decrease in anti-Proteus mirabilis but not anti-Escherichia coli antibody levels  in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with fasting and a one year vegetarian diet.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli antibody levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during treatment by vegetarian diet. METHODS: Sera were collected from 53 RA patients who took part in a controlled clinical trial of fasting and a one year vegetarian diet. P mirabilis and E coli antibody levels were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and an enzyme immunoassay, respectively. RESULTS: The patients on the vegetarian diet had a significant reduction in the mean anti-proteus titres at all time points during the study, compared with baseline values (all p < 0.05). No significant change in titre was observed in patients who followed an omnivorous diet. The decrease in anti-proteus titre was greater in the patients who responded well to the vegetarian diet compared with diet non-responders and omnivores. The total IgG concentration and levels of antibody against E coli, however, were almost unchanged in all patient groups during the trial. The decrease from baseline in proteus antibody levels correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with the decrease in a modified Stoke disease activity index. CONCLUSION: The decrease in P mirabilis antibody levels in the diet responders and the correlation between the decrease in proteus antibody level and decrease in disease activity supports the suggestion of an aetiopathogenetic role for P mirabilis in RA.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - Requirement for FlhA in flagella assembly and swarm-cell differentiation by Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Swarming by Proteus mirabilis is characterized by cycles of rapid population migration across surfaces, following differentiation of typical rods into long, aseptate swarm cells that overexpress flagella and virulence factors, particularly haemolysin. A non-swarming Tn5phoA mutant was unable to synthesize flagella, to fully elongate or to induce high levels of the toxin. The mutation lay within a 2091 bp gene encoding a homologue of the Escherichia coli FlhA belonging to a family of proteins that are required for assembly of flagella or virulence proteins and that are suggested to act either directly in membrane translocation and/or in regulating synthesis of the export apparatus. In trans expression of multicopy flhA restored cell elongation and migration and generated differentiation-specific hyperexpression of flagellin and toxin genes to levels above those seen in the wild-type strain. Transcription of flhA was strongly induced during differentiation, from its own putative sigma 28 promoter. The results suggest a mechanistic coupling of flagella assembly and swarm-cell differentiation.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the NapA acid phosphatase/phosphotransferase of Morganella morganii: identification of a new family of bacterial acid-phosphatase-encoding genes.
AB  - The gene encoding a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named NapA) of Morganella morganii was cloned and sequenced, and its product characterized. NapA is a secreted acid phosphatase composed of four 27 kDa polypeptide subunits. The enzyme is active on several organic phosphate monoesters but not on diesters, and is also endowed with transphosphorylating activity from organic phosphoric acid esters to nucleosides and other compounds with free hydroxyl groups. Its activity is inhibited by EDTA, inorganic phosphate, nucleosides and Ca2+, but not by fluoride or tartrate, and is enhanced by Mg2+, Co2+ and Zn2+. At the sequence level, the NapA enzyme did not show similarities to any other sequenced bacterial phosphatases. However, a search for homologous genes in sequence databases allowed identification of two open reading frames located within sequenced regions of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis genomes respectively, encoding proteins of unknown function which are highly homologous to the Morganella enzyme. Moreover, the properties of the NapA enzyme are very similar to those reported for the periplasmic nonspecific acid phosphatase II of Salmonella typhimurium (for which no sequence data are available). These data point to the existence of a new family of bacterial acid phosphatases, which we propose designating class B bacterial acid phosphatases.
TI  - [Uro-intestinal fistulas of cancerous origin].
AB  - Malignant entero-vesical fistulas are uncommon. Colonic malignancy is the main cause although fistula are present in just 1%. Pneumaturia and fecaluria are pathognomonic for entero-vesico-fistula and are present in half of cases. By combining the results of cystoscopy, barium enema and urine culture, fistula can be identified in almost all the cases. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis are very often isolated from the urine cultures. The management of entero-vesical-fistula depends of the etiology. The treatment requires in most of the case resection of the diseased bowel with partial cystectomy and primary anastomosis. But sometimes, is necessary to perform a diverting colostomy and urinary diversion.
TI  - Effects of silver on adherence of bacteria to urinary catheters: in vitro studies.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. The relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. For strains of E. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. Antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. The radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.
TI  - [Antimicrobial and sporicidal efficacy of various disinfectant solutions].
AB  - The often indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents has led to increased bacterial resistance over the past years. This phenomenon is above all evident in nosocomial environments but also at a community level. It is therefore important that, in addition to the rational use of antibiotics, an accurate prophylaxis is performed which includes the correct use of disinfectants. This study examines the antimicrobial activity of various commercially available disinfectant solutions consisting of one or more active ingredients. An analysis of the results reveals that products consisting of an association of individual components (quaternary ammonium chloride with o-phenylphenol and/or isopropyl alcohol; chlorhexidine with benzalkonium chloride or with diazolidinylurea and isopropanol) demonstrate a greater efficacy in terms of microbicidal concentration and contact times.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparison of single-dose regimens of rufloxacin and pefloxacin for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. French Multicenter Urinary Tract Infection-Rufloxacin Group.
AB  - In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, 463 adult women with symptomatic acute uncomplicated cystitis were treated orally with either a 400-mg single dose of rufloxacin (n = 226) or an 800-mg single dose of pefloxacin (n = 237). Escherichia coli (78%) and Proteus mirabilis (7%) were the most common isolates from 350 patients with significant pretreatment bacteriuria (uropathogens, > or = 10(5) CFU/ml). In the intention-to-treat analysis of patients with significant pretreatment bacteriuria, 343 patients were assessed for bacteriological outcome and 345 were assessed for clinical outcome. The bacteriological cure rate was 88% in the rufloxacin group and 84% in the pefloxacin group (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference in proportions, -4 to 12%), while the clinical resolution rate was 85 and 84%, respectively (95% CI, -8 to 9%). The per-protocol analysis demonstrated that among the 264 assessable patients, the bacteriological cure rate obtained with rufloxacin at 4 weeks of follow-up was comparable to that with pefloxacin (91 versus 85%; 95% CI, -3 to 15%). Among 295 clinically assessable patients, the clinical resolution rate at 4 weeks of follow-up was 89% in the rufloxacin group and 88% in the pefloxacin group (95% CI, -6 to 10%). Potentially drug-related adverse events occurred in 19% of the rufloxacin patients and in 18% of the pefloxacin patients. A single oral dose of 400 mg of rufloxacin is as effective and safe as a single oral dose of 800 mg of pefloxacin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women.
TI  - The specificity of the anti-Proteus antibody response in tissue-typed rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) patients from Brest.
AB  - Anti-Proteus mirabilis antibody titres were found to be elevated in 50 active tissue-typed French rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients from Brest when compared to 49 healthy French controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; P < 0.001) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA; P < 0.001). However, there was no significant elevation in antibody titres against Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium in the RA patients compared to the controls when measured by ELISA. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were also found to be significantly higher in RA patients when compared to healthy control subjects (P < 0.001). These results suggest that P. mirabilis may play an important and specific role in the triggering and persistence of RA.
TI  - Molecular cloning and site-directed mutagenesis of glutathione S-transferase from Escherichia coli. The conserved tyrosyl residue near the N terminus is not essential for catalysis.
AB  - Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was purified from Escherichia coli K-12, and its  N-terminal sequence was determined to be MKLFYKPGAXSLAS. The gene encoding this sequence was cloned and mapped at 1731-1732 kilobases on the E. coli gene map. It encoded a polypeptide of 201 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 22,860. The overexpressed product of the gene was confirmed to have GST activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and ethacrynic acid and GSH-dependent peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide. The relative molecular mass of the gene product was determined to be 40,000 by gel chromatography and 25,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating a homodimeric structure. The deduced amino acid sequence was 54% identical with that of Proteus mirabilis GST. Although the homologies between the GSTs from E. coli and mammals were low, many of the residues assigned to be important for the enzymatic function or structure in mammalian cytosolic GSTs were found to be conserved in E. coli GST. Therefore, E. coli GST is considered to have diverged from the same ancestor with other cytosolic GSTs. A specific tyrosyl residue in the vicinity of the N terminus is conserved in all of the known cytosolic GSTs and has been shown to function as a catalytic residue in alpha, mu, and pi class GSTs from mammals. Although Tyr5 in E. coli GST appeared to be the counterpart of the catalytic residue, its replacement with phenylalanine did not significantly affect the enzymatic activity. Therefore, this apparently conserved tyrosyl residue is not essential for catalytic activity in E. coli GST.
TI  - A plasmid-encoded surface protein on Enterococcus faecalis augments its internalization by cultured intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Aggregation substance, a plasmid-encoded Enterococcus faecalis surface protein, plays a role in mediating the formation of mating aggregates, resulting in plasmid transfer. The role of aggregation substance in the internalization of E. faecalis by cultured intestinal epithelial cells, namely HT-29 cells, was analyzed. It was associated with a significant increase in endocytosis of E. faecalis by HT-29 cells: Numbers of internalized enterococci were fewer than of an invasive strain of Listeria monocytogenes, similar to Salmonella typhimurium and another L. monocytogenes strain, and greater than relatively noninvasive strains of E. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Electron microscopy confirmed aggregation substance on the surface of strains interacting with the enterocyte microvillous surface, and intracellular enterococci were localized within membrane-bound vacuoles in the enterocyte cytoplasm. Thus, aggregation substance may facilitate E. faecalis internalization by host epithelial cells.
TI  - Rapid identification of micro-organisms from urinary tract infections by beta-glucuronidase, phenylalanine deaminase, cytochrome oxidase and indole tests on isolation media.
AB  - Two commercially available media recommended for the isolation and rapid identification of Escherichia coli from urinary tract infections were supplemented with L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan. The non-selective medium proved suitable for the direct detection of lactose fermentation, beta-glucuronidase and phenylalanine deaminase activities, indole production and the oxidase test. It was highly efficient in making a presumptive identification at species level of the most common gram-negative urinary pathogens, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that account for c. 85% of all urinary isolates. Among the gram-positive isolates, most colonies were non-fluorescent and could be separated into staphylococci and enterococci on the basis of the catalase test. Fluorescent colonies were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates, 61% of which were fluorescent. The selective medium proved suitable for the same biochemical tests, with the exception of indole, which was not visible against the red colour of the medium. Therefore, the differentiation of P. mirabilis from other Proteus-Providencia species was impossible on this medium.
TI  - Isolated fibrils rescue cohesion and development in the Dsp mutant of Myxococcus  xanthus.
AB  - Extracellular fibrils are involved in cell cohesion and cell development in Myxococcus xanthus. One group of social motility mutants, Dsp, is unable to produce extracellular fibrils; these mutants also lose the abilities to cohere and to develop. Extracellular fibrils isolated from vegetative wild-type cells and added to Dsp cells fully restored the abilities of these cells to cohere and to undergo normal morphological development. The fibrils thus mimic the ability of intact, wild-type cells to carry out the same rescue. Optimal cohesion rescue by fibrils required calcium and magnesium ions, did not require protein synthesis, but was energy dependent, i.e., sodium azide and sodium cyanide blocked rescue. Cohesion rescue was also blocked by the diazo dye Congo red. Cohesion rescue is genus specific, i.e., isolated fibrils did not cause the cohesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, or the related myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca. Developmental rescue of Dsp by isolated fibrils included aggregation, fruiting body formation, and myxospore morphogenesis. Developmental gene expression in the Dsp mutant was only partially rescued by the isolated fibrils.
TI  - [Use of a combination of cefoperazone with sulbactam for treatment of patients with wound infections].
AB  - The clinical efficacy of sulperazone (cefoperazone + sulbactam) manufactured by Pfizer (USA) was studied in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infections. By the disease severity and complications 9 patients belonged to the risk group. Insulators with abacterial media or bandages with ointments on the polyethylene glycol base and drugs stimulating reparative processes (methyl-diadioxylin, dioxyzol, gentacycol) were used for the local treatment of the wounds. The clinical efficacy was stated in 92 per cent of the cases and in 76 per cent of the cases the efficacy was bacteriological. The tolerance of sulperazon was good in all the cases. The signs of the drug intolerance or affection of the hepatic or renal function were not detected. 281 clinical isolates of the aerobic microflora were tested for their antibiotic susceptibility. The highest susceptibility to sulperazone was observed in gram-positive organisms, gram-negative bacilli (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.) and some nonfermenting bacteria.
TI  - Single-step purification of Proteus mirabilis urease accessory protein UreE, a protein with a naturally occurring histidine tail, by nickel chelate affinity chromatography.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis urease, a nickel metalloenzyme, is essential for the virulence  of this species in the urinary tract. Escherichia coli containing cloned structural genes ureA, ureB, and ureC and accessory genes ureD, ureE, ureF, and ureG displays urease activity when cultured in M9 minimal medium. To study the involvement of one of these accessory genes in the synthesis of active urease, deletion mutations were constructed. Cultures of a ureE deletion mutant did not produce an active urease in minimal medium. Urease activity, however, was partially restored by the addition of 5 microM NiCl2 to the medium. The predicted amino acid sequence of UreE, which concludes with seven histidine residues among the last eight C-terminal residues (His-His-His-His-Asp-His-His-His), suggested that UreE may act as a Ni2+ chelator for the urease operon. To exploit this potential metal-binding motif, we attempted to purify UreE from cytoplasmic extracts of E. coli containing cloned urease genes. Soluble protein was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, a metal chelate resin with high affinity for polyhistidine tails, and bound protein was eluted with a 0 to 0.5 M imidazole gradient. A single polypeptide of 20-kDa apparent molecular size, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10 to 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was eluted between 0.25 and 0.4 M imidazole. The N-terminal 10 amino acids of the eluted polypeptide exactly matched the deduced amino acid sequence of P. mirabilis UreE. The molecular size of the native protein was estimated on a Superdex 75 column to be 36 kDa, suggesting that the protein is a dimer. These data suggest that UreE is a Ni(2)+-binding protein that is necessary for synthesis of a catalytically active urease at low Ni(2+) concentrations.
TI  - The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole inhibits acid survival of Helicobacter pylori by a urease-independent mechanism.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Omeprazole, a benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor, has an antibacterial effect against Helicobacter pylori at neutral pH and inhibits its urease activity. The aim of this study was to characterize H. pylori acid resistance and to determine whether omeprazole effects its survival at low pH. METHODS: We studied survival of H. pylori and other enteric organisms in buffered solutions (pH 2-7) in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/L urea and/or omeprazole. RESULTS: In the absence of urea, the acid tolerances of wild-type H. pylori, a urease-negative H. pylori mutant, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were similar. In the presence of urea, the survival of the wild-type H. pylori at pH 2 was significantly greater than that of the other organisms. Omeprazole (100 micrograms/mL) had a marked inhibitory effect on the survival of both wild-type and urease-negative H. pylori at low pH, and similar effects on E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas survival of H. pylori below pH 4 is urease dependent, H. pylori uses non-urease-mediated mechanisms at or above pH 4. Omeprazole inhibits the survival of H. pylori at low pH through a mechanism independent of its effect on urease, an antibacterial effect that extends to other enteric bacteria.
TI  - Virulence determinants of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The urinary tract is among the most common sites of bacterial infection and E. coli is by far the most common infecting agent. In patients with urinary catheters in place or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, Proteus mirabilis is also a frequent isolate. To study virulence of these bacterial species, we have isolated the genes that encode putative virulence factors, constructed specific mutations within these genes, introduced the mutation back into the wild type strain by allelic exchange, and analyzed these mutants for virulence in appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. Specific virulence markers have been identified for strains that cause urinary tract infection. For E. coli, these include P fimbriae, S fimbriae, hemolysin, aerobactin, serum resistance, and a small group of O-serotypes. Redundant virulence factors must be present in these organisms as mutation of the most clearly identified epidemiological marker, P fimbriae, does not result in attenuation of a virulent strain. For P. mirabilis, urease appears to contribute most significantly to virulence. Fimbriae play a significant but more subtle role in colonization. Hemolysin, although potently cytotoxic to renal cells in vitro, does not appear to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of ascending urinary tract infection. We can conclude that the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis caused by uropathogenic E. coli and P. mirabilis are multifactorial, as mutation of single genes rarely causes significant attenuation of virulence.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis in ankylosing spondylitis: effect of sulfasalazine treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To make a longitudinal study of antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to assess treatment effects. As a comparison we measured antibodies of 2 other gut associated bacteria, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: In a double blind study in 84 Finnish outpatients with AS before and after 26 weeks' treatment with sulfasalazine or placebo we measured serum antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli and Proteus mirabilis with ELISA: Serum samples of 100 healthy blood donors served as controls. RESULTS: The levels of IgA class antibodies to all 3 bacteria were statistically significantly higher in the sera of the patients compared to the controls. During sulfasalazine treatment significant decreases were observed in concentrations of the IgA class antibodies to Klebsiella and E. coli whereas only a slight decrease was observed in the concentrations of IgA antibodies to Proteus mirabilis. There were no correlations between the clinical and laboratory results observed with sulfasalazine and decrease in concentrations of IgA class antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our results agree with the role of gut associated lymphoid tissue in the pathogenesis of AS, but do not totally exclude Klebsiella pneumoniae as a specific agent contributing to the development of AS.
TI  - Sequence and genetic analysis of multiple flagellin-encoding genes from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Surface-induced overproduction of flagellin is one of the hallmarks of Proteus mirabilis swarmer cell differentiation. In this study, we analyzed the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences, and expression of the P. mirabilis flagellin-encoding gene (fliC) region. The nt sequence analysis of a 3567-bp region reveals three ORFs, each with homology to known Escherichia coli flagellar genes. The first ORF corresponds to fliD, the gene encoding the flagellar filament capping protein, FliD (HAP2). The second and third ORFs are highly homologous to each other and to fliC genes from many other Gram- bacteria. To distinguish between the two alleles, we have designated these genes fliC1 and fliC2. Sequences highly homologous to promoter sites for the alternate sigma factor of RNA polymerase, sigma 28, are found 5' to the start of each gene. Additionally, both fliC1 and fliC2 have a conserved direct tandem repeat (DTR) sequence upstream from the sigma 28 promoter that may have functional significance in the transcriptional control of fliC expression during swarmer cell differentiation. Both FliC1 and FliC2 were produced in E. coli, but only FliC1 could complement FliC- mutants of E. coli. Southern hybridization data indicate the presence of fliC1 and fliC2 in six distinct P. mirabilis strains, indicating that multiple flagellin-encoding genes are common in P. mirabilis. Hybridization data also suggest the presence of a third flagellin-encoding gene, fliC3, in all isolates. The possible significance of multiple fliC in swarmer cell differentiation is discussed.
TI  - Hemoglobin, a newly recognized lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein that enhances LPS biological activity.
AB  - Cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) is a purified preparation of human hemoglobin that is being developed as a resuscitation fluid. In vivo administration of hemoglobin has resulted in significant toxicity, due in part to contamination with bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). To better understand this toxicity, we have studied the interaction between Hb and LPS. Mixtures of each of three different Hb preparations (cross-linked alpha alpha Hb, cross-linked carbon monoxy-alpha alpha HbCO, and non-cross-linked (native) HbAo) and LPS (Escherichia coli O26:B6 or Proteus mirabilis S1959) were examined by several independent methods for evidence of Hb.LPS complex formation. Binding assays in microtiter plates demonstrated saturable binding of LPS to immobilized Hb, with a kD of 3.1 x 10(-8) M. Binding of LPS to Hb also was demonstrated wiht a radiolabeled LPS photoaffinity probe. Ultrafiltration of Hb/LPS mixtures by 300- and 100-kDa cut-off membranes showed that the majority of LPS in these mixtures (87-97 and 64-72%, respectively) was detected in the filtrates, in contrast to the lack of filterability of LPS in the absence of Hb. Density centrifugation demonstrated that LPS co-migrated with each of the three Hbs, whereas unbound LPS had a distinctly greater sedimentation velocity than Hb or Hb.LPS complexes. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that in the presence of Hb, LPS migrated into the gel and co-electrophoresed with Hb, whereas LPS alone did not appreciably enter the gel. Finally, precipitation by ethanol of each of the three Hb preparations was increased in the presence of LPS compared with precipitation in the absence of LPS. Interaction of LPS with each of the three Hb preparations was also associated with altered biological activity of LPS, as shown by enhancement of LPS activation of Limulus amebocyte lysate. Therefore, our data provide several lines of independent evidence for Hb-LPS complex formation and indicated that LPS exhibited altered physical characteristics and enhanced biological activity in the presence of Hb.
TI  - [Experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  - The role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological factor in the development of bladder cancer. The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with UTI at the Kyushu University Hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mM) in a growth medium (pH 7.2) at 37 degrees C. Of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microM NO2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of E. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microM) could be detected. Various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. The effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. The mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees C was assayed by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test (using TA100 or TA98 with S9-mix). The mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing S. marcescens or P. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. Potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an XAD-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 3 for 4 hrs. The potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. The mutagen formation at an optimal pH 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. It was noted that even at a physiological pH 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. The mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 6. Mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. The levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The single-stranded-DNA-binding proteins (SSB) of Proteus mirabilis and Serratia  marcescens.
AB  - The single-stranded-DNA-binding (SSB) proteins from Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens were purified from overproducing Escherichia coli strains, which were devoid of their own ssb gene. The strains harboured an endA insertion mutation and a xonA mutation resulting in the absence of endonuclease I and exonuclease I activities from the preparations. The amino acid sequences of the SSB of all three species are nearly identical in the N-terminal parts of the proteins that contain the DNA-binding domain, but differ in the C-terminal parts. Both proteins have an apparent binding-site size of 65 and 35 nucleotides at high and low salt concentrations, respectively. The association-rate constant for binding to poly(dT) is 3.2 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 for P. mirabilis SSB (PmiSSB) and 3.4 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 for S. marcescens SSB (SmaSSB). These binding parameters are very similar to those of E. coli SSB (EcoSSB). The structural similarity of the proteins is also documented by the finding that they can exchange subunits among each other to form mixed tetramers. The transcriptional regulation of the ssb and uvrA genes from P. mirabilis and S. marcescens in SOS-induced E. coli cells was studied using lacZ fusions. While the uvrA genes were inducible, there was no induction of the ssb genes transcribed divergently from the uvrA genes. Apparently, regions with nucleotide sequence similarity to the E. coli SOS-box preceding the ssb genes of P. mirabilis and S. marcescens had no gross effect on the transcription. Studies on growth of the cells and recovery from ultraviolet damage indicate that the heterologous SSB proteins support DNA replication and recombinational DNA repair of E. coli with the same efficiency as the E. coli SSB protein. Interactions with other E. coli proteins involved in these processes either do not occur, or are not impeded.
TI  - Analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable peptidoglycan autolysins of select  gram-negative pathogens by using renaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - For the first time, peptidoglycan autolysins from cellular fractions derived from sonicated cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Escherichia coli W7, Klebsiella pneumoniae CWK2, and Proteus mirabilis 19 were detected and partially characterized by zymogram analysis. Purified murein sacculi from P. aeruginosa PAO1 were incorporated into a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel at a concentration of 0.05% (wt/vol) to serve as a substrate for the separated autolysins. At least 11 autolysin bands of various intensities with M(r)s ranging between 17,000 and 122,000 were detected in each of the homogenated cultures. Some of the autolysins of the four bacteria had similar M(r)s. The zymogram analysis was used to show that a number of the autolysins from E. coli were inhibited by the heavy metals Hg2+ and Cu2+, at 1 and 10 mM, respectively, high ionic strengths, and reagents known to affect the packing of lipopolysaccharides. The activity of an autolysin with an M(r) of 65,000 was also impaired by penicillin G, whereas it was enhanced by gentamicin. A preliminary screen to determine the relationship between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and autolysins was carried out by using a dual assay in which radiolabelled penicillin V bands were visualized on an autolysin zymogram. Radiolabelled bands corresponding to PBPs 3, 4, 5, and 6 from E. coli and P. aeruginosa; PBPs 3, 4, and 6 from Proteus mirabilis; and PBP 6 from K. pneumoniae degraded the murein sacculi in the gels and were presumed to have autolytic activity, although the possibility of two distinct enzymes, each with one of the activities, comigrating in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels could not be excluded. Some radiolabelled bands possessed an Mr of <34,000 and coincided with similar low-Mr autolysin bands.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of FK-037, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, a novel parenteral oxime-type cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefepime, cefpirome, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin against a total of 668 recent clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) colony forming units). FK-037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas species, and Haemophilus influenzae at < or = 1 microgram/ml. FK-037 was less active against Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas species, requiring 16 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and was inactive against Xanthomonas maltophilia. FK-037 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 1 microgram/ml and 90% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus at < or = 8 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - [Agents of clinically significant bacteriuria].
AB  - Bacterial composition of cultures isolated from 468 patients hospitalized at the  urologic surgery department was analyzed to elucidate the etiologic structure of clinically significant bacteriurias. A total of 342 bacterial cultures were isolated. In 63.7% of cases monocultures were isolated, in 66.7% the isolated cultures were referred to Enterobacteriaceae and in 18.7% to Pseudomonas. The most significant agents of bacteriurias were Escherichia coli. Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Genes encoding high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae are part of gene clusters.
AB  - We previously reported the cloning and sequencing of genes designated hmw1 and hmw2 from a prototype nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain. The genes encode proteins which are related to filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella pertussis and promote attachment of the nontypeable H. influenzae strain to human epithelial cells (J. W. St. Geme III, S. Falkow, and S. J. Barenkamp, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2875-2879, 1993). Subcloning studies suggested that correct processing of these high-molecular-weight proteins required the products of additional downstream genes. In the present study we analyzed the 3'-flanking regions of the hmw1A and hmw2A structural genes and found that both genes are flanked by two additional downstream open reading frames (ORFs), designated B and C, respectively. The B ORFs are 1,635 bp long. Their derived amino acid sequences are 99% identical and demonstrate similarity to the derived amino acid sequences of two genes that encode proteins required for secretion and activation of hemolysins of Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. The C ORFs are 1,950 bp long, and their derived amino acid sequences are 96% identical. In Escherichia coli transformants, interruption of the hmw1C or both the hmw1B and hmw1C genes resulted in defective processing of the hmw1A structural gene product and loss of the ability of the transformants to adhere to human epithelial cells. The precise interactions of the proteins encoded by these gene clusters are yet to be defined, but their elucidation may further our understanding of the biology of nontypeable H. influenzae bacteria and the interaction of these organisms with the human host.
TI  - Bees aren't the only ones: swarming in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Swarming is a form of active surface motility that is widespread among flagellated, Gram-negative bacteria. In the laboratory, growth of the bacteria on certain agar surfaces leads to induction of the differentiated swarmer-cell state. Swarmer cells are generally long and multinucleate, always hyperflagellated, and can move rapidly over the agar surface in a coordinated manner. Some swarm colonies exude large amounts of 'slime', which could be essential for promoting intimate cell-cell contacts during swarming. There is evidence that the differentiated swarmer-cell stage facilitates pathogenic associations with host tissue. Almost nothing is known about the molecular signalling mechanism of surface sensing. Increased viscosity appears to be sensed by several bacteria, but other environmental cues, specific to each bacterium, are also important. In organisms in which swarming motility has been studied in some detail, the chemotaxis system has been shown to play an important role. The recent discovery of swarming motility in two genetically well-characterized organisms--Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium--should lead to rapid progress in understanding this process.
TI  - The features and aetiology of Fournier's gangrene.
AB  - This paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (Fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. Even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women as well. The disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. The commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. The infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. Fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of isepamicin against fresh clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of isepamicin (ISP), MICs of ISP as well  as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many strains of Gram-negative bacilli that were clinically isolated in 1993. 1. No ISP-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. or Proteus mirabilis. 2. ISP-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The frequency of resistant strains in each species, however, was lower for ISP than other AGs. 3. When MIC90s were compared, antibacterial activities of ISP determined in this study were quite similar to those determined during the drug's development period (1980's) in Japan, suggesting no increase in the number of ISP-resistant strains over the years. 4. The number of clinically isolated Gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs are increasing in from year to year Japan. Our results in this study suggest that antibacterial activities of ISP may be potent enough against such Gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - Bacteriuria in patients with a continent ileal reservoir for urinary diversion does not regularly require antibiotic treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the importance of bacteriuria in patients with a continent urinary diversion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen asymptomatic patients (16 women and two men, with a mean age of 53 years [range 22-73]) with ileal reservoirs coupled to the skin for urinary diversion were studied. Consecutive urine cultures were performed over 5 months. Concomitant measurements of antibody titres against Escherichia coli and Proteus, and C-reactive protein (CRP) values were made. RESULTS: The results of the urine cultures varied considerably between samples. Increased titres of antibodies against E. coli were seen in several patients but the correlation with bacteriuria caused by E. coli was weak (sensitivity 33%, specificity 56%). Increased titres of antibodies against Proteus were rarely seen and in no patient correlated with bacteriuria caused by Proteus. Increased levels of CRP were seen in three patients. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with a continent ileal reservoir for urinary diversion is generally of no clinical importance and should not be treated with antibiotics. This conclusion is based on the observations that the bacterial strains growing in the reservoir changed spontaneously indicating colonization rather than infection. Raised titres of antibodies against E. coli correlated weakly with bacterial growth. The observed elevations in antibody titres were usually just above the normal upper limit.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of Bridelia ferruginea (Euphorbiaceae).
AB  - Water and ethanol extracts of Bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. The extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella sp. The zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. Sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. The Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the Gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against common intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - The activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against pathogens usually involved in intra-abdominal infections was studied. Metronidazole 1 g and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) were simultaneously administered i.v. over 30 minutes every 24 hours to 12 healthy volunteers for three doses. Serum samples were collected at baseline, just before the last dose, and 12, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours after the start of infusion of the last dose. Serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) were performed in duplicate for each serum sample from 12 hours on. Serum ceftriaxone and metronidazole concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the elimination rate and half-life were calculated for each antimicrobial in each volunteer. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antibiotic for two strains each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis were determined by microdilution. Eleven volunteers completed the study. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole maintained SBTs of at least 1:4. Serum ceftriaxone concentrations remained above the MICs for E. coli, P. mirabilis, and K. pneumoniae, and serum metronidazole concentrations remained above the MIC for B. fragilis throughout the study. Ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole resulted in intense and prolonged activity against E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and B. fragilis.
TI  - Investigation of synergism with combinations of dibromopropamidine isethionate or propamidine isethionate and polymyxin B.
AB  - Combinations of polymyxin B and dibromopropamidine isethionate exhibited synergistic inhibitory and bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Similar results were obtained with polymyxin B plus propamidine combinations except that propamidine was not as active as dibromopropamidine and the combination of polymyxin B plus propamidine against S. aureus only had additive activity. The antibacterial agents were tested in solutions and in a cream formulation. The findings indicate a potential for the use of selected combinations of these antibacterial agents in the treatment of wound and superficial eye infections.

AB  - An additional case of perinephric abscess post-ESWL is described. The clinical and radiological features and the therapeutic approach are discussed. The literature is briefly reviewed.
TI  - Bacterial translocation in cultured enterocytes: magnitude, specificity, and electron microscopic observations of endocytosis.
AB  - Previous in vivo evidence has shown that bacterial phagocytosis by enterocytes may be an initial step in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium. This study analyzed the interactions of cultured enterocytes, namely Caco-2 cells, with nine strains of enteric bacteria, tested in pure culture and in mixed culture. These nine strains had a spectrum of invasive potential and included Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (three strains), Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Numbers of viable intracellular bacteria recovered from Caco-2 cells were: L. monocytogenes > S. typhimurium > P. mirabilis > E. coli > E. faecalis. Uptake of a given microbe by enterocytes was strain-specific and was not influenced by the presence of another strain, regardless of the invasive ability of the coinfecting strain. Electron microscopic visualization of bacterial adherence and uptake by Caco-2 cells indicated that the epithelial interactions of normal enteric bacteria were similar to these observed with invasive strains of salmonella and listeria.
TI  - Bacteremia in a long term care facility.
AB  - Episodes of bacteremia identified in a long term care facility over a seven and a half-year period from July 1984 to December 1991 were reviewed. Twenty-nine episodes of bacteremia were identified, a rate of 4.35/100,000 patient-days. The most common infecting organisms were Escherichia coli (11 episodes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (four), Proteus mirabilis (three), Staphylococcus aureus (three) and Bacteroides species (two). The source of bacteremia was urinary in 45% of patients, gastrointestinal in 17%, pneumonia in 14%, skin in 14% and unknown in 10%. The overall case fatality rate was 24%, but for the final six years of the review the case fatality rate was only 9.5%. These observations report a rate of bacteremia 10-fold lower than reported from other North American long term care facilities and, potentially, a lower case fatality rate. The primary site of bacteremia, however, in long term care facilities is the urinary tract.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract to various segments of the mesenteric lymph node complex.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis translocate to different segments of the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) complex at levels reflecting their population levels in the regions of the gastrointestinal tract that provide lymph to these various MLN segments. Salmonella typhimurium, however, translocates to all segments of the MLN complex equally regardless of regional intestinal population levels.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Over a period of one month, five isolates of Proteus mirabilis resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins colonized or infected five patients of the same intensive care unit. The antibiotic resistance phenotype and the metabolic profiles of the five strains were identical. All five produced a plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase closely related to TEM-3/CTX-1 according to its pI (6.3), to its substrate profile and to the hybridization of the corresponding gene with blaTEM-3 specific oligonucleotide probes. Ability to produce this enzyme transferred by conjugation to Escherichia coli along with aminoglycoside and sulphonamide resistance. These resistance markers were encoded by a plasmid, (pAP1) which was identical in all five isolates but which was different from the TEM-3 beta-lactamase plasmids found in other Enterobacteriaceae. Plasmid pAP1 differed by its smaller size (47 kb), its EcoRI restriction pattern, its resistance co-markers (AAC(6') and sulphonamide only) and its much lower transfer frequency (2 x 10(-8)). Furthermore this plasmid did not belong to any known Enterobacteriaceae incompatibility group.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Hematogenous osteomyelitis in infants and children in the northwestern region of  Namibia. Management and two-year results.
AB  - We reviewed the records of fifty-five children, including eleven infants (three of whom were neonates), who had at least one skeletal manifestation of hematogenous osteomyelitis. Forty-two of the patients were boys and thirteen were girls. The patients were classified into three groups: those who had early acute, those who had late acute, and those who had chronic osteomyelitis. This classification system was based on clinical and radiographic criteria. Seven patients had early acute osteomyelitis; eighteen, late acute osteomyelitis; and thirty, chronic osteomyelitis. The bones most often affected were the tibia (twenty-two patients) and the femur (nineteen patients). Penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus grew on culture of specimens of purulent material from twenty-nine (76 per cent) of thirty-eight patients. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter grew on culture of specimens of purulent material from one patient each. Six cultures showed no growth. No purulent material was obtained from seventeen of the fifty-five patients. The seven patients who had early acute osteomyelitis, and four of the eighteen patients who had late acute osteomyelitis, responded well to antibiotic treatment only. A combination of antibiotic and operative treatment was needed in fourteen of the eighteen patients who had late acute osteomyelitis and in all thirty patients who had chronic osteomyelitis. Forty-nine of the fifty-five patients were followed for two years; the remaining six patients were lost to follow-up. The two-year results were good in nineteen of the twenty-three patients who had acute (early or late) osteomyelitis and in fifteen of the twenty-six patients who had chronic osteomyelitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the Proteus mirabilis gene for a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and complementation of Escherichia coli ssb point and deletion mutations.
AB  - The gene of Proteus mirabilis coding for a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) was cloned in Escherichia coli from a genomic library. It restored the UV resistance and the rate of cell division of an E. coli ssb-113 mutant to the same extent as the cloned E. coli ssb+ gene did. An E. coli mutant with deleted ssb was viable with the P. mirabilis ssb+ gene provided on a single-copy-number plasmid and had the same cell division rate as with the E. coli ssb+ gene on the same vector plasmid. The recovery from UV damage of an excision repair deficient (uvrA) mutant deleted for the ssb gene was identical with the ssb+ gene from P. mirabilis or E. coli, suggesting full substitution in recombinational DNA repair of the homologous by the heterologous SSB protein. The nucleotide sequence of the gene revealed that the SSB has 81% amino acid sequence homology with the E. coli SSB and only 58-63% with various plasmid SSBs. The data provide evidence that the bacterial chromosomally coded SSBs and the plasmid encoded SSBs constitute separate groups.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of a siderophore. 3. The activity of deferoxamine in vitro and its influence on the effect of antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of deferoxamine (DFO) both per se and in combination with the reductant ascorbic acid (AA) was determined against 10 E. coli strains, 5 P. mirabilis strains, and 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci. In terms of interaction, the influence of DFO on the activities of cephalothin and gentamicin was furthermore investigated against the same panel of strains employing a macrobroth dilution technique and killing-curve kinetics. The MICs of cephalothin and gentamicin were lowered for one half of the strains. Moreover, DFO prolonged the generation times of logarithmic growth phase considerably, especially when the reductant AA was present. The interactions between DFO or DFO+AA and subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were established by the application of growth constants, and resulted in synergy for 15 out of 25 strains with cephalothin and 9 out of 25 strains with gentamicin.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of crude extracts of Mitracarpus villosus.
AB  - Mature leaves and inflorescence of Mitracarpus villosus, collected from Niger State, Nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a Waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. The crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. The extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. The ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chain length on interactions of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein and its bioactive 23-kilodalton NH2-terminal fragment with isolated LPS and intact Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The target-specific cytotoxicity for gram-negative bacteria and the endotoxin-neutralizing activity of the 55-kDa bactericidal/Permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and its bioactive 23-kDa NH2-terminal fragment depend on the strong attraction of BPI for the lipid A region of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We have shown before that smooth gram-negative bacteria with long-chain LPS are more resistant to BPI (especially holo-BPI) than are rough strains. It has been suggested that the high BPI resistance of some gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis, might also reflect the structural diversity of lipid A. To explore this possibility, we compared the antibacterial activity and binding of natural and recombinant holo-BPI and a recombinant NH2-terminal fragment (rBPI-23) to an isogenic rough (Re-LPS chemotype) and a smooth (S-LPS chemotype) strain of P. mirabilis and to LPS isolated from the two strains. Holo-BPI and rBPI-23 were both potently active against the Re strain of P. mirabilis (90% lethal dose, 20 nM). In contrast, the smooth strain was > or = 100 times more resistant to holo-BPI but only 10 times more resistant to rBPI-23. rBPI-23 was also more potent against several Escherichia coli strains from clinical bacteremia isolates. Differences in the antibacterial potency of BPI toward the Re and S strains of P. mirabilis correlated with differences in the binding of holo-BPI and rBPI-23 to these bacteria. In contrast, the binding of biosynthetically (in vitro transcribed and translated) 35S-labeled holo-BPI and NH2-terminal fragment to isolated Re- and S-LPS from P. mirabilis in solution was similar. Moreover, in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, holo-BPI and rBPI-23 potently neutralized both forms of LPS with equal effectiveness. Together, these results strongly suggest that BPI recognizes Proteus lipid A and that the relative resistance of (smooth) P. mirabilis to holo-BPI is due to the inhibitory effect of long polysaccharide chains of tightly packed LPS in the envelope.
TI  - Mutational analysis of the Bordetella pertussis fim/fha gene cluster: identification of a gene with sequence similarities to haemolysin accessory genes involved in export of FHA.
AB  - The chromosome of Bordetella pertussis harbours a region of 27 contiguous kb, which contains the bvg, fha and fim genes, involved in the co-ordinate regulation of virulence genes, FHA production and fimbriae production, respectively. The linkage of FHA and fimbrial genes has resulted in some confusion concerning the existence and location of genes required for the production of FHA and the function of the fimbrial genes fimB-D, which were proposed to be involved in both FHA and fimbriae biosynthesis. Through the use of non-polar mutations in each of these genes, we found that fimB-D are required for the production of both serotype 2 and 3 fimbriae, but not for FHA biosynthesis. Furthermore, a large open reading frame, designated fhaC, was identified downstream of fimD. It was shown that fhaC is essential for FHA production but not for fimbriae biogenesis. We propose that insertion mutations in fimB-D affect FHA production because of polar effects on fhaC expression. An insertion in the region downstream of fhaC had only a slight effect on FHA and fimbriae production. The fhaC gene product shows homology with ShIB and HpmB, two outer membrane proteins involved in export and activation of the haemolysins, ShIA and HpmA, of Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis, respectively. Homology is also observed between the N-termini of FHA, ShIA and HpmA. Export of the haemolysins requires the N-termini of these molecules, and when this region was removed from FHA by an in-frame deletion, FHA biosynthesis was abolished. These results suggest that the N-terminus of FHA interacts with FhaC, and that as a result FHA is transported across the outer membrane.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary cellulitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.
AB  - Eight episodes of gram-negative bacillary cellulitis in seven patients with hepatic cirrhosis are reported. The patients comprised five women and two men (mean age 59.6 years). The diagnosis was based on a positive culture of specimens obtained by needle aspiration from cutaneous lesions. All patients had grade C cirrhosis according to Pugh's classification. Cellulitis involved the lower extremities in all cases. Five patients developed bullous lesions, three ulcers, two abscesses and two extensive cutaneous necrosis. A single bacterial species was found in seven cases. Organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), Proteus mirabilis (1 case) and Aeromonas hydrophila (1 case). Bacteremia was documented in six cases. Four patients died, death being related to sepsis in three of them. It is concluded that gram-negative bacilli should be considered as possible pathogens in severe infectious cellulitis in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Microbiological study of cutaneous specimens obtained by needle aspiration may be of high diagnostic value in these cases.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - [Dr. Wang's tube--study of a new technique for eliminating pathogens in sperm preparation for reproductive medicine].
AB  - A total of 30 ejaculates has been tested for ejaculate volume, spermatozoal concentration, motility, agglomeration, agglutination and contamination by microorganisms. After that the ejaculate has been washed twice and transferred in the Dr. Wangs Tube which was filled with medium before. After an incubation time of 90 minutes very quickly moving spermatozoan could be observed through the microscope in the upper part (C-D) of the Tube. After the Tube was cut by means of a special glasscutter the motility of the containing spermatozoans of part C-D has been determined again, followed by a second bacteriological examination of the so prepared ejaculate. The results of sperm preparation with the Dr. Wangs Tube regarding the sperm motility has been very good (85.7% of the sperm samples showed a motility rate of 90% or even more after treatment). The bacteriological examination has been satisfactory: in 77.7% of the cases all existing sperm bacterias has been eliminated by preparation in the Dr. Wangs Tube. Among other microorganisms Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus which are considered to be pathologic could be isolated from five of the ejaculates and have been removed after treatment with the Dr. Wangs Tube. The handling of the Tube was rather demanding and Technically problematic. There has been caused glass-splinters by cutting the Tube which got visible while observing the ejaculate-medium-liquid through the microscope. Their sizes were nearly equivalent to the size of a sperms head or even bigger. If the so prepared ejaculate would be used for insemination and in-vitro fertilisation the very small splinters may destroy the success of the treatment and should be avoided or removed. The Dr. Wangs Tube offers a new modified swim-up technique for sperm preparation and is able to produce a high quality, nearly sterile sperm sample. Because of the technical deficiency of the system, the high purchase and running costs and the very small output (sperm sample volume, number of spermatozoans) the Dr. Wangs Tube is not be recommended for the reproductive medicine in its present shape.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of combinations of EDTA-Tris and amikacin or neomycin on the microorganisms associated with otitis externa in dogs.
AB  - Combinations of EDTA-Tris and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin and neomycin) were tested for synergistic activities against the microorganisms associated with otitis externa in dogs and for the solutions' stability over time. Synergistic activity was observed when EDTA-Tris plus amikacin and EDTA-Tris plus neomycin were tested against Staphylococcus intermedius, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, but not against Candida albicans. Stability studies over a 3-month period indicated that the test solutions were stable at room temperature and that their antimicrobial activity was maintained.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - [Staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. Bacteriologic aspects].
AB  - Struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. Ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. Incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. This trial examines the bacteriologic aspects pre and post-ESWL. Eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (UTI) were submitted to urine cultures pre and post-ESWL. The first 50 patients underwent during and post-ESWL, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of generalized sepsis. No patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. With respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-ESWL UTI, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a UTI post-ESWL. The distribution of organisms pre and post-ESWL was as follows: Proteus mirabilis (22/22), Escherichia coli (11/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), Enterobacter cloacae (0/1), Alcaligenes odorans (1/2) Enterococcus faecalis (1/3), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and Candida albicans (1/1). In this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-ESWL probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. According to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. In 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial infection.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration and in-vitro activity of loracarbef, a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of loracarbef in plasma and a mild inflammatory exudate were studied in human volunteers. After a single oral dose of 400 mg, a mean maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of 17.8 mg/L was achieved in the plasma at 1.2 h (mean Tmax). The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) was 1.3 h. In the inflammatory exudate the mean Cmax was 8.9 mg/L at a mean Tmax of 2.0 h and with a mean T1/2 of 1.7 h. The mean penetration into the inflammatory exudate was 90.1%. The in-vitro activity of loracarbef was determined against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L respectively, regardless of beta-lactamase production), as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 of 2 mg/L). Loracarbef was also active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s of < or = 2 mg/L). The in-vitro activity and pharmacokinetics of loracarbef suggest that it would be efficative therapy for patients with community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by the most frequently-encountered bacterial pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - The effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  - The effect of a direct electric current (10 microA) on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was investigated. When the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. The zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. Zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. Bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were similarly affected by the application of a 10 microA electric current. A negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. The results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. This may offer a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

TI  - [A case of transverse myelitis with good outcome].
AB  - The study presents a case of transverse myelitis in a 22 year old male. MRI was used to establish the diagnosis. It ought to be mentioned that, according to the medical literature, cases with paraplegia and total sensory loss have a rather poor prognosis. Hence the described case is a rare example of transverse myelitis which was successfully treated.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. Cefepime was active at low concentrations (MIC50 values < or = 0.06 mg/L and MIC90 values < or = 0.12 mg/L) against non-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.). For Klebsiella pneumoniae, MICs were between 0.016 and 16 mg/L; the highest MIC values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing Enterobacter cloacae, MICs were < or = 0.5 mg/L, but MICs against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. Ticarcillin-sensitive strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/L, while cefepime MICs were 8-64 mg/L for strains resistant to ticarcillin. The cefepime MIC50 value for Haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/L. Against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime MICs were 0.5-16 mg/L; MICs against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/L). Against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime MIC values were 0.03-16 mg/L; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/L. Streptococci (Groups A, C and G) were sensitive to cefepime with MICs ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/L (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L; MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). The activity of cefepime against Group B streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with MIC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Most enterococci and all Listeria monocytogenes strains had MICs > or = 32 mg/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  - Urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in Oklahoma. Of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were: Escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), Pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Providencia stuartii (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of P. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting P. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  - The genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD [EC 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a Pseudomonas putida (formerly P. aeruginosa) (ATCC 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. Plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed using known amino acid sequences. A 1.5-kb SmaI fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading frames, designated pcaH and pcaG, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-PCD. The amino acid sequences deduced from pcaHG matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-PCD in all except three positions. Cloning of pcaHG into broad-host-range expression vector pKMY319 allowed high levels of expression in P. putida strains, as well as in Proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahG promoter with salicylate. The recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from P. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-PCD. The physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. These studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of P. putida 3,4-PCD, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.
TI  - Iontophoresis and chloride-containing compounds: parameters required for killing.
AB  - Fungi, and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were susceptible to iontophoretic killing in simple media. Iontophoresis did not depend on electrode type but did require chloride-containing compounds in the medium. All organisms could be killed efficiently if chloride-containing compounds (for example sodium chloride and calcium chloride) were present in physiological concentrations. Effectiveness of iontophoretic killing could be reduced by nonphysiologically elevated concentrations of other substances (for example creatinine and albumin). The data suggest that iontophoresis should function well in urine, since chloride-containing compounds are present in adequate concentrations even if some naturally occurring compounds, such as creatinine or albumin, are elevated.
TI  - Characterization of ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae: a multicentre study in 26 French hospitals. Vigil'Roc Study Group.
AB  - During a multicentre study performed in 26 French hospitals, 287 (3.2%) of 9038 Enterobacteriaceae isolated, mainly Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. were classified as ceftriaxone resistant on the basis of an MIC > 4 mg/L or the presence of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was present mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae (65 strains, 10.2%) and very rarely in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases conferred low-level resistance to ceftriaxone in nearly 60% of the strains harbouring them, emphasizing the need for routine testing for the presence of these enzymes. Among transconjugants three types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were identified. Those resembling TEM-3 were the most common, but TEM-21, and SHV-4 were also found. Clavulanate and to a lesser extent sulbactam inhibited all the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases encountered in this study.
TI  - The effect of cytokines on bactericidal activity of murine neutrophils.
AB  - A range of recombinant cytokines have now been shown to modify aspects of the phenotype and function of human and murine neutrophils. However, few reports describe modification of the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. We therefore examined the recombinant murine cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, 10-1000 ng ml-1) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF, 10-1000 U ml-1) for their ability to increase the bacterial killing capacity of murine neutrophils. Neutrophils from either bone marrow (fresh or cultured), or peritoneal exudates, or abscesses, were pre-incubated with either cytokine for 30-60 min and the killing of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, or Bacteroides fragilis was examined in the presence or absence of serum over a 90 min period. Only for one combination was a small but significantly enhanced level of bacterial killing observed, the phagocytic killing of P. mirabilis by peritoneal exudate neutrophils in the presence of GM-CSF and serum. With this exception there was no enhancement of bacterial killing for the range of combinations of neutrophils and bacterial species tested. In contrast, at the concentrations tested for effect on bactericidal activity, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF were able to significantly upregulate CR3 (but not Fc gamma RII) expression on mouse neutrophils. These results indicate that upregulation of CR3 as an index of neutrophil activation does not necessarily correlate with increased bactericidal activity.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  - One hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. Beta-Lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-Lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 Streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 Escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 Bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 Proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 Staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). Anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%). However, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. Therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - Development of a catheterised bladder model to evaluate urinary drainage equipment.
AB  - A catheterised bladder model was developed to examine the design features of urinary drainage bags. The drainage bag of 4 commonly used products was inoculated with either Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis. The speed of retrograde contamination towards the "bladder" was determined over 96 h. The effect of lifting the drainage bag above the level of the "bladder" was examined also. Within 4 days micro-organisms were detected in the backflow valves/drip chambers of all products, but contamination had not progressed as far as the catheter. Ps. mirabilis appeared to migrate more rapidly than Esch. coli. Lifting the drainage bag had no effect on the migration of either organism. The implications of these results for clinical practice are discussed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after non-lethal hemorrhage in the rat.
AB  - Translocation of enteric bacteria has been suggested to compromise patients in severe catabolic stress. Mechanisms for this route of infection are not known. In this study, rats were subjected to hemorrhage without reinfusion during 60 min, total blood loss was 3.28 +/- 0.14 ml/100 g BW. Control groups consisted of sham-operated animals without bleeding, and rats not operated at all. The mean number of viable bacteria found in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of bled animals was 168 +/- 45 colony forming units (c.f.u./MLN), significantly higher compared to sham operated (5 +/- 3 c.f.u./MLN) and not operated (0 +/- 0 c.f.u./MLN) controls (P < 0.01). Cultures from MLN were positive in 7/9 rats after bleeding, in 3/9 of sham operated, and in 0/6 of non-instrumented control animals. No positive blood cultures were isolated. Escherichia coli was the dominant species found in MLN. A biochemical fingerprinting method (the PhP system) was used to identify translocating strains of E. coli among strains found in cecum. The method was also used to compare translocating strains between different animals. Our findings reveal that bacteria translocate to MLN after hemorrhage. Some phenotypes of E. coli strains translocate more frequently than others, suggesting that they have properties facilitating translocation.
TI  - Hepatobiliary complications in healthy, intra-abdominally infected, and high-output fistula rats receiving total parenteral nutrition.
AB  - This study examines the pathophysiology of hepatobiliary complications induced by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) by using animal models that underwent cecal ligation to produce intra-abdominal infection and received an enterostomy to mimic a high-output fistula, which causes the interruption of enterohepatic circulation of bile salt. Aspartate transaminase was elevated after TPN (p < .05). Alkaline phosphatase was increased in animals receiving TPN plus an enterostomy (p < .05). Serum albumin was significantly decreased in animals receiving TPN plus undergoing cecal ligation or enterostomy (p < .05). Liver weight and liver protein and water content decreased in animals receiving TPN alone (p < .05). Liver water content increased in animals receiving TPN plus undergoing cecal ligation (p < .05). Liver lipid content increased after TPN and to a significant degree in rats receiving TPN plus undergoing cecal ligation or enterostomy (p < .05). Bile flow diminished after TPN and to a level reaching significance in animals receiving TPN plus undergoing cecal ligation or enterostomy (p < .05). Reduction of bile flow, decrease of biliary cholesterol secretion, and increase of biliary bilirubin secretion, which may be the cause of TPN-induced bilirubinate stones, were most significant in animals receiving TPN plus undergoing cecal ligation (p < .05). In conclusion, TPN can induce hepatic dysfunction and bilirubinate stones, but these complications are more common in animals with associated intra-abdominal infection or high-output fistula.
TI  - Bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984-1989).
AB  - Twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH), University of California, Davis, between 1984 and 1989. Characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13 foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. Laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dL), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microL), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microL). Thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. In 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. Microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (TBA) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. Microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. Tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. Cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or postmortem. Virologic examination of TBA, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. Viral culture of TBA from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type II (EHV-II). In addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. Pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. The predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. Many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. The peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. Type II cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  - In order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (CFTM), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from July 1990 to June 1991 and from July 1992 to February 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. The obtained results are summarized below. 1. No CFTM-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. It appeared that Streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were increasing. The former included benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) of PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "Extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. The MIC's of beta-lactams against the above PISP or PRSP, and against cephems-resistant E. coli tended to be high, but those of CFTM were relatively low (in most cases). 3. Proportions of strains resistant to cephems, including CFTM among Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri were high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. As mentioned above, CFTM is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. Except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of MIC90's, and as far as MIC80's are concerned, CFTM still is as active as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - Blockage of urethral catheters by bacterial biofilms.
AB  - We report the case of a 63-year-old woman whose indwelling urethral catheter became blocked regularly at 4-5 day intervals over a period of 10 weeks. 'Worm-like' structures 25-30 cm in length were found either in the catheter, completely occluding the lumen, or in the drainage tube thereby blocking the valve of the drainage bag. Electron microscopy showed that these structures were composed of bacteria, while culture revealed them to be mixed communities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Following treatment with ciprofloxacin, catheter drainage continued freely for a further period of 10 weeks.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to hydrophilic polymer-coated polyurethane stents.
AB  - Biliary stent blockage by adherence of bacteria and formation of biofilm is a major problem in endoscopic stenting procedures. We have investigated bacterial adherence to hydrophilic polymer (Hydromer)-coated polyurethane stents in stationary and perfusion experiments. Adherence of gram negative and gram positive organisms under stationary conditions was similar between Hydromer-coated and non-coated control polyurethane stents; however, a marked 1 to 3 log reduction in adherence to Hydromer-coated stents occurred when perfusion experiments in phosphate buffer solution or bile were performed. The results suggest that Hydromer-coated polyurethane stents could be useful in preventing complications caused by biliary stent blockage.
TI  - The ureter in vitro: normal motility and response to urinary pathogens.
AB  - The effects of bacteria on in vitro ureteric contractility were studied, using a  model which allowed selective exposure of organisms to the ureteric mucosa and smooth muscle, respectively. A cannula attached to a pressure transducer was ligated into the proximal lumen of 2.5-cm segments of canine ureter. The distal ureter was ligated to form a closed pressure monitored system, and the segment suspended in a 20-ml organ bath containing Krebs Henseleit buffer at physiological pH and temperature. Following onset of spontaneous activity, broths of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were added to either the buffer solution or ureteric lumen in doses of > 10(6) organisms/ml. Experiments were repeated using heat-killed organisms, bacterial filtrates and E. coli endotoxin. Ureteric contractility was stimulated by organisms added to the buffer medium, but reversibly inhibited by bacteria placed in the ureteric lumen. Heat-killed organisms, endotoxin and live filtrates had no effect on normal motility when exposed to either the ureteric mucosa or muscularis respectively. These findings reflect the conflicting changes in ureteric motility seen in vivo when bacteria are administered systemically or directly into the ureteric lumen.
TI  - Review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by MEDLINE; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. STUDY SELECTION: Only published comparative clinical trial reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. Noncomparative clinical data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the Food and Drug Administration are not included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. In clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. Cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. Cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.
TI  - Effect of LPS on epithelial integrity and bacterial uptake in the polarized human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been speculated to facilitate bacterial translocation by a mechanism involving physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. Polarized, cultured intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 cells) were used to study the effect of LPS on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. Varying concentrations of biologically active LPS were incubated with enterocytes for 1 and 16 hr. LPS had no noticeable effect on enterocyte viability or morphology, as measured by uptake of vital dyes, by distribution of cytoskeletal filamentous actin, and by visualization of subcellular ultrastructure. Transepithelial electrical resistance was similar in enterocyte cultures incubated with LPS for 1 hr, but there was a noticeable decrease after 16 hr, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity after prolonged exposure to LPS. The effect of LPS on bacterial uptake was studied using six strains of enteric bacteria with varying abilities to invade Caco-2 cells: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli (2 strains), and Enterococcus faecalis. Electron microscopy showed enteric bacteria in intimate association with enterocyte apical microvilli, and internalized bacteria were consistently observed within cytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles. Following a 1-hr incubation of individual strains of enteric bacteria with Caco-2 cells, numbers of viable intracellular bacteria varied significantly between individual bacterial strains, but numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for each strain incubated with enterocytes exposed to 0, 10, and 100 micrograms LPS for 1 and 16 hr. Thus, although prolonged exposure to LPS might have some effect on enterocyte culture integrity (as measured by decreased electrical resistance), LPS had no discernible effect on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. These results suggested that LPS-induced bacterial translocation might not involve loss of epithelial viability, or facilitated entry of bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Infection and antibiotic therapy in 4000 burned patients treated in Milan, Italy, between 1976 and 1988.
AB  - The pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. Between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. The most frequent isolates were: Pseud. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae, such as Acinetobacter, Citrobacter. The most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus isolates. Staph. aureus, Klebsiella and E. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; Enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and Pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. E. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and P. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. Thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of Enterococcus spp. and E. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of Enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of two different dosage regimens of imipenem in an in-vitro dynamic model.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of imipenem was tested in an in-vitro model mimicking  human serum pharmacokinetics after either 1000 mg im once daily or 500 mg im twice daily. Six recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella group B were used as test strains. Our results suggest that a single daily dose of imipenem 1000 mg im exerts an antibacterial action comparable to that obtained with two divided doses of 500 mg.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - [Histamine release from mast cell induced by main pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infections in Guangzhou area].
AB  - The methodology for isolating rat peritoneal mast cell was established. The main  pathogenic bacterial ultrasonicates of respiratory infection in GuangZhou area have been examined for their ability to release histamine from purified rat peritoneal mast cells. The results were as following: (1) 7 pathogenic bacteria can cause direct release of histamine from rat mast cells. The most effective histamine releasers were P. mira (histamine release percent is 26.89% +/- 6.70%), Strep. Pneu (24.16% +/- 3.71%), E. Coli (20.40% +/- 4.83%) and K. Pneu (17.91% +/- 4.60%). (2) Histamine release initiated by bacterial ultrasonicates was completed within 30 minutes E. Coli differed from K. Pneu induced histamine release was independent of its dose. (3) The products of K. Pneu did not induce histamine release directly and bacterial hemolysin may play a potent role in bacteria-induced release of histamine. Our findings provide some evidence for mechanism by which respiratory bacterial infection can precipitate or exacerbate attacks of bronchial asthma.
TI  - Sequence of the Proteus mirabilis urease accessory gene ureG.
AB  - We report the sequence of ureG, an accessory gene that is a part of the ure gene  cluster of uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis and required for full enzymatic activity of urease. The 615-bp open reading frame predicts a M(r) 22,374 polypeptide, which contains a consensus amino acid (aa) sequence for ATP-binding. The polypeptide shares sequence homology with UreG of Escherichia coli (93% of identical aa), Klebsiella aerogenes (59%) and Helicobacter pylori (59%).
TI  - Cloning, expression and sequencing of Helicobacter felis urease genes.
AB  - Urease genes from Helicobacter felis were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. A genomic bank of Sau3A-digested H. felis chromosomal DNA was created using a cosmid vector. Cosmid clones were screened for urease activity following subculture on a nitrogen-limiting medium. Subcloning of DNA from an urease-positive cosmid clone led to the construction of pILL205 (9.5 kb) which conferred a urease activity of 1.2 +/- 0.5 mumole urea min-1 mg-1 bacterial protein to E. coli HB101 bacteria grown on a nitrogen-limiting medium. Random mutagenesis using a MiniTn3-Km transposable element permitted the identification of three DNA regions on pILL205 which were necessary for the expression of an urease-positive phenotype in E. coli clones. To localize the putative structural genes of H. felis on pILL205, extracts of clones harbouring the mutated copies of the plasmid were analysed by Western blotting with anti-H. felis rabbit serum. One mutant clone did not synthesize the putative UreB subunit of H. felis urease and it was postulated that the transposable element had disrupted the corresponding structural gene. By sequencing the DNA region adjacent to the transposon insertion site two open reading frames, designated ureA and ureB, were identified. The polypeptides encoded by these genes had calculated molecular masses of 26,074 and 61,663 Da, respectively, and shared 73.5% and 88.2% identity with the corresponding gene products of Helicobacter pylori urease.
TI  - Genotoxicity studies in semiconductor industry. 1. In vitro mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies of waste samples resulting from plasma etching.
AB  - Solid waste samples taken from the etching reactor, the turbo pump, and the waste air system of a plasma etching technology line in semiconductor production were studied as to their genotoxic properties in a bacterial repair test, in the Ames/Salmonella microsome assay, in the SOS chromotest, in primary mouse hepatocytes, and in Chinese hamster V79 cell cultures. All three waste samples were found to be active by inducing of unscheduled DNA-synthesis in mouse hepatocytes in vitro. In the bacterial rec-type repair test with Proteus mirabilis, waste samples taken from the turbo pump and the vacuum pipe system were not genotoxic. The waste sample taken from the chlorine-mediated plasma reactor was clearly positive in the bacterial repair assay and in the SOS chromotest wit Escherichia coli. Mutagenic activity was demonstrated for all samples in the presence and absence of S9 mix made from mouse liver homogenate. Again, highest mutagenic activity was recorded for the waste sample taken from the plasma reactor, while samples collected from the turbo pump and from the waste air system before dilution and liberation of the air were less mutagenic. For all samples chromosomal damage in V79 cells was not detected, indicating absence of clastogenic activity in vitro. Altogether, these results indicate generation of genotoxic and mutagenic products as a consequence of chlorine-mediated plasma etching in the microelectronics industry and the presence of genotoxins even in places distant from the plasma reactor. Occupational exposure can be expected both from the precipitated wastes and from chemicals reaching the environment with the air stream.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in the community].
AB  - 4,612 urine samples were sent to this laboratory in 1990, and the results of those sent during a single week in each of the 4 seasons were studied. Of 4501 urinary cultures sent from the general population, 811 (80%) were positive for E. coli, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis. 60% were resistant to ampicillin, 35% to cotrimoxazole and 20% to cephalexin. Of 111 urine samples sent from senior citizen homes, 57 (80%) were positive for E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas. 74% were resistant to ampicillin, 72% to cotrimoxazole and 46% to cephalexin. Ofloxacin and norfloxacin were very effective in urinary tract infections in the general population, with 94% and 97% sensitive to them, respectively. 68% of the urinary cultures sent from the senior citizen centers were sensitive to each of them.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of isoxazolyl++ naphthoquinones. I].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of 2-hydroxy-N-(3,4-dimethyl-5-isoxazolyl) 1,4 naphthoquinone-4-imine (I) and three of this derivatives against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis y Morganella morganii was investigated. From the four naphthoquinone-imine studied, compound I exhibited activity against S. aureus. This effect was observed even in oxygen atmosphere with 5% CO2 and in the presence of human albumin. The development of drug-resistant strains by serial passage in media with concentrations lower than the C.I.M. was determined in 31 strains of S. aureus from clinical material and one from collection. No significant differences in C.I.M. were observed.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis urease: histidine 320 of UreC is essential for urea hydrolysis  and nickel ion binding within the native enzyme.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis urease, a nickel-containing enzyme, has been established as a critical virulence determinant in urinary tract infection. An amino acid sequence (residues 308 to 327: TVDEHLDMLMVCHHLDPSIP) within the large urease subunit, UreC, is highly conserved for every urease examined thus far and has been suggested to reside within the enzyme active site. Histidine residues have been postulated to play a role in catalysis by coordinating Ni2+ ions. To test this hypothesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to change amino acid His-320 to Leu-320 within UreC. The base change (CAT for His-320 to CTT for Leu-320) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant and mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels in Escherichia coli as detected by Western blotting (immunoblotting) of denaturing and nondenaturing gels. Specific activities of the enzymes were quantitated after partial purification. Strains expressing the mutant enzyme showed no detectable activity, whereas strains expressing the recombinant enzyme hydrolyzed urea at 149 mumol of NH3 per min per mg of protein. In addition, the mutant enzyme was able to incorporate only about one-half (58%) of the amount of 63Ni2+ incorporated by the active recombinant enzyme. While the mutation of His-320 to Leu-320 within UreC does not affect expression or assembly of urease polypeptide subunits UreA, UreB, and UreC His-320 of UreC is required for urea hydrolysis and proper incorporation of Ni2+ into apoenzyme.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  - Bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. Adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. In E. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. On the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as S. epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of the aminothiazolyl cephalosporin RU 29,246.
AB  - A total of 1,007 clinical isolates from a tertiary care center were tested against RU 29,246, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, Augmentin, oxacillin, piperacillin, gentamicin, amikacin and vancomycin. Bacteria tested consisted of 479 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 64 pseudomonads, 18 Xanthomonas, 42 other gram-negative bacilli, 56 enterococci and 348 isolates of staphylococci. RU 29,246 showed excellent in vitro activity inhibiting > 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia, Morganella, Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophila, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at an MIC of 0.5-1.0 mg/l. Seventy-seven percent coagulase-negative staphylococci had an MIC of 1.0-4.0 mg/l. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and X. maltophilia were resistant to RU 29,246. Fifty-six percent of the enterococcal isolates were inhibited by 1.0-16.0 mg/l of RU 29,246.
TI  - Oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. Ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (two strains), Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and a Bacteroides sp. The phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. The three Listeria strains were the most susceptible to phagocytic uptake and the Salmonella strain was relatively resistant. The intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. The strains with the best intracellular survival were Ent. faecalis and two of the three Listeria strains. The ability of S. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two E. coli strains. Oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.
TI  - In vitro loss of tensile strength and elasticity of five absorbable suture materials in sterile and infected canine urine.
AB  - The loss of breaking strength and elasticity of five absorbable suture materials  (polydioxanone [PDS-II], polyglycolic acid [PGA], polyglactin 910 [PG-910], polyglyconate [GTMC], and chromic gut) after in vitro incubation in sterile, Escherichia coli- and Proteus mirabilis-inoculated canine urine was studied. Biomechanical testing, in a controlled environment, was performed during the 28-day study period. Polydioxanone and chromic gut retained greater than 90% of their original strengths after 28 days of incubation in sterile urine and 87% of original strengths in E. coli-inoculated urine. Polyglyconate retained 24% and 18% of original strength, respectively, after incubation in sterile and E. coli-inoculated urine for 28 days. Polyglycolic acid and PG-910 retained less than 30% of original strength in sterile urine and only 7% in E. coli-inoculated urine after 21 days of incubation. In P. mirabilis-inoculated urine, loss of tensile strength and elongation was significant for all suture materials. Polyglycolic acid and PG-910 lost all strength after 24 hours of incubation. Polydioxanone lost all strength after 7 days of incubation, whereas GTMC retained 19% at day 7. Chromic gut retained 78% at day 7 and 16% after 21 days of incubation, however, the absence of normal phagocytic destruction of chromic gut in this in vitro study may have artificially elevated these values. In sterile urine with chemically modified pH, loss of strength and elongation was greater in alkaline urine than in neutral or acidic urine for all types of suture materials.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - Biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase I. Its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. Biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - [A clinical study on upper urinary tract calculi treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) monotherapy, with regard to bacteriuria before ESWL treatment].
AB  - To study a clinical problem in urolithiasis complicated with bacteriuria treated  by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), we studied relationships between the frequency of bacteriuria and some clinical factors such as sex, location of, size of and composition of calculi in patients with upper urinary tract calculi. We also evaluated whether bacteriuria caused fever elevation after ESWL monotherapy. Six hundred seventy patients with upper urinary tract calculi, 440 renal calculi and 230 ureteral calculi, were subjected to the present study. The results were summarized as follows: 1) Bacteriuria was found in 40 of 440 patients with renal calculi (9%) and 12 of 230 patients with ureteral calculi (5%). 2) The frequency of bacteriuria was significantly higher in female (11%) than in male (6%) (p < 0.05). 3) Ten strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7 of Escherichia coli and 6 of Proteus mirabilis were isolated in patients with bacteriuria. 4) On the location of renal calculi in patients with bacteriuria, 37 out of 40 patients (93%) were found in R2. In contrast, bacteriuria was the most frequently found in DS 6 (19%), whereas the positive rates were about 10% in DS 3 (7%), DS 4 (*7%) and DS 5 (9%). The presence of bacteriuria was not related to the location of calculi or the size of calculi in patients with ureteral calculi. 5) Most of the calculi with bacteriuria were composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate or the mixture of calcium phosphate and carbonate with or without oxalate. 6) Patients with bacteriuria had a significantly higher rate of fever elevation after ESWL than those without bacteriuria (p < 0.01).
TI  - [An urease enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection].
AB  - A sensitive and specific serological diagnostic test for Helicobacter pylori infection has been developed and validated in 120 patients with dyspeptic symptoms undergoing endoscopy. This test is to use urease, a protein unique to H. pylori, as the basis for the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects serum H. pylori urease antibodies. The ELISA mean optical density (OD) in H. pylori-positive group is higher than that in H. pylori-negative group (0.57 +/- 0.23 vs 0.24 +/- 0.15, P < 0.001), a cut-off 0.3 OD yields a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93%. Serum absorption test showed that Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolotica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell lysate do not influence serum H. pylori urease antibody level, though they all have urease except E. coli. The result implied that H. pylori urease can be a good antigen to detect serum H. pylori antibody and it would be useful for epidemiological survey and routine diagnostic approach. Nearly half of the blood donors showed positive result with H. pylori urease antibody. It is suggested that H. pylori infection is quite common in the asymptomatic population.
TI  - Loracarbef. A review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  - Loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. At low concentrations (< 2 mg/L) in vitro, it inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups B, C and G. Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. At therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. When administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. Loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is administered twice daily. It offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - Spontaneous and experimental infections in scid and scid/beige mice.
AB  - Severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice are valuable animals to study a variety of physiologic and disease processes. Their capacity to support multiple tissue xenografts permits these mice to be used as intermediate models for host-specific, fastidious organisms for which a small animal model has not been available previously. However, because they are unable to mount a normal immune response, they are very susceptible to a variety of primary and opportunistic microbial pathogens. Fatal, naturally occurring infections with bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans, and Escherichia coli have been observed. In addition, based on observations after experimental or naturally occurring viral infections, scid and scid/beige mice have been shown to be very susceptible to infections with viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, and murine respiratory virus, with resulting mortality. Of the parasitic infections, Pneumocystis carinii is a relatively common contaminant of the respiratory tracts of scid mice and may complicate research projects, particularly experimental respiratory tract infections. In view of the enhanced susceptibility of these mice to infections of this type, it is essential that they be housed under optimal conditions, which include implementing stringent management practices and a functional barrier system.
TI  - Serum and urinary cefpodoxime levels and time killing curves performed in the urine of children presenting urinary tract infections.
AB  - Since resistance to several oral antimicrobials useful for the treatment of pediatric urinary tract infections (UTI) is overwhelming in Argentina, an in vitro investigation was performed testing 400 isolates obtained from urines of children suffering UTI's, 200 collected in 1990 and 200 in 1991. Their susceptibility against oral antimicrobials marketed in Argentina and appropriate for the treatment of UTI was determined by the agar dilution methods. An increase of the resistance to aminopenicillin combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors and to fluoroquinolones was observed comparing the two periods. Cefpodoxime (CPD), cefixime and fluoroquinolones except norfloxacin were the sole oral antimicrobials showing in vitro activity at the 90 per cent level. Unfortunately fluoroquinolones are not yet approved for pediatric use. Consequently we realized an in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic study in order to determine CPD activity against E. coli isolated in UTI cases. Five children (6-10 y) showing E. coli UTI infections received 10 mg/kg/d CPD in a single oral daily dose and were treated up to 10 days, 3 had lower UTI and 2 upper UTI. All patients were clinical and bacteriologically cured. Cultures obtained up to 4 weeks after treatment were negative. CPD serum levels at 2 hours after the first dose of treatment showed a median of 2.7 mg/l (2.3-3.4 range). Bactericidal serum titers at the same time against the patients own strain and an E. coli TEM-1 hyperproducer strain (MIC 4,096 mg/l for ampicillin and 0.5 mg/l for CPD) showed a median value of 1/8 against patients strains and 1/2 against the THP strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. A total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. Of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. All were included in the safety analysis. Clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. Bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18 (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. One Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. Persisting organisms with amoxicillin included Haemophilus influenzae (four), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), Escherichia coli (two), Streptococcus pneumoniae (one), Neisseria species (one), and Proteus mirabilis (one). Adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. Insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. Fleroxacin may be indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due to Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis. The 92% incidence of resistance among the S. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.
TI  - A sequential study of intravenous and oral fleroxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study enrolled patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in  a trial to determine the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with intravenous fleroxacin (first 3 days) followed by oral fleroxacin, for a total course of 7-14 days, both administered at a dosage of 400 mg once a day. We enrolled 68 patients with complicated UTIs or acute pyelonephritis, 32 of whom were evaluable for bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. The pathogens isolated included Escherichia coli, 15; enterococci, 9; miscellaneous, 15. Intravenous fleroxacin was given for a mean of 3.2 days, followed by oral fleroxacin for a mean of 5.3 days. A total of 27 patients were clinically cured (84%), two improved, and three failed. A total of 26 patients were bacteriologically cured (81%), and six failed (19%). The bacteria that were not eradicated included enterococci, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; and Pseudomonas species, 1. One enterococcal isolate became resistant to fleroxacin. Four patients were bacteremic (E. coli, 3; Proteus mirabilis, 1); the pathogen was eradicated in all cases. Two patients developed urinary enterococcal superinfections. A total of 12 patients experienced 16 adverse reactions remotely, possibly, or probably related to fleroxacin (insomnia, 3; dizziness, 2; miscellaneous, 11). One patient had a grand mal seizure after aspirating gastric contents; the seizure was thought to be only remotely related to the study drug. Fleroxacin was discontinued in two patients because of adverse effects (phlebitis at intravenous access site, 1; anxiety and insomnia, 1). Only minor and asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities were observed. All clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved with discontinuation of the study drug. Fleroxacin is a safe and effective antibiotic for sequential intravenous and oral treatment of acute pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs. Enterococci may be problematic pathogens, as reported with other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Osteomyelitis in sickle cell disease.
AB  - Records of the Sickle Cell Clinics of the South Carolina Children's Rehabilitative Services from 1977 to 1990 were analyzed for cases of osteomyelitis. Cases included in the study demonstrated either positive bone cultures or blood cultures with correlating radiographs. Seven hundred seventeen charts were reviewed, and 16 cases of osteomyelitis were identified in 15 patients. Thirteen cases were due to Salmonella sp., one was due to Proteus mirabilis, one to Escherichia coli, and one to Staphylococcus aureus. The annual incidence of osteomyelitis in our series was 0.36%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefcanel.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration of cefcanel, a new oral cephalosporin, has been determined for 182 clinical isolates, of which 84 were from the family Enterobacteriaceae, 45 were from the genus Streptococcus, 18 were nonfermentative rods, 25 were Haemophilus influenzae and 10 were Branhamella catarrhalis. In general, cefcanel was more active than the other cephalosporins against the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis. Among the genus Streptococcus only the enterococci were resistant to cefcanel. H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis showed also a reasonable susceptibility towards cefcanel. Oxidative rods were highly resistant to cefcanel.
TI  - Characterization of a plasmid-encoded urease gene cluster found in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Plasmid-encoded urease gene clusters found in uropathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, and Salmonella cubana demonstrated DNA homology, similar positions of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites, and manners of urease expression and therefore represent the same locus. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the plasmid-encoded urease genes are closely related to the Proteus mirabilis urease genes.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  - Immunological characterization of various Pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using sera from infected humans and from patients with other bacterial infections. Somatic (SOM) and partially purified cell extracts (PCE) gave more complex SDS-PAGE patterns: M(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kDa, respectively. The culture-filtrated antigens (CF) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands M(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kDa. PCE and CF reacted specifically with infected human sera; SOM did not. The components with M(r) of 40 kDa in CF reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri. This peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in CF thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.
TI  - Outer membrane permeability barrier to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin in gram-negative enteric bacteria.
AB  - Mutations which severely affect the function of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (lpxA and firA mutations of lipid A synthesis and rfaE mutation of the lipopolysaccharide inner-core synthesis) were found to decrease the MICs of erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin by factors of 32 to 512, 32 to 1,024, 64 to 512, and 16 to 64, respectively. The sensitization factors for three other hydrophobic antibiotics (rifampin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin) ranged from 16 to 300. The outer membrane permeability-increasing agents polymyxin B nonapeptide (3 micrograms/ml) and deacylpolymyxin B (1 microgram/ml) sensitized wild-type E. coli to azithromycin by factors of 10 and 30, respectively. Quantitatively very similar sensitization to the other macrolides took place. Polymyxin-resistant pmrA mutants of S. typhimurium displayed no cross-resistance to azithromycin. Proteus mirabilis mutants which were sensitized to polymyxin by a factor of > or = 300 to > or = 1,000 had a maximal two- to fourfold increase in sensitivity to azithromycin. These results indicate that azithromycin and the other new macrolides use the hydrophobic pathway across the outer membrane and that the intact outer membrane is an effective barrier against them. Furthermore, the results indicate that azithromycin, in contrast to polymyxin, does not effectively diffuse through the outer membrane by interacting electrostatically with the lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Adjuvant activity of the Escherichia coli WF table L-form cytoplasmic membranes.
AB  - It was established that the stable E. coli WF+ L-form cytoplasmic membranes (CM)  increase the antibody response in rabbit during experimental hyperimmunization with cells of Streptococcus pyogenes A49 and Proteus mirabilis D52. Using the skin-induration test and the reaction for aggregation of macrophages in presence of homologous antigens it was established that CM increase the cell-mediated immunity of guinea-pigs to protein antigens of the same bacterial strains.
TI  - [Antibacterial chemotherapy of "septic kidney"].
AB  - In the present retrospective study we report on antibacterial chemotherapy in patients suffering from a septic kidney. The results were documented in a course table, in which the septic parameters were divided into scores from 0 to 4 allowing to follow each patient's course with respect to the indicated scores. Two antibacterial substances were applied as short infusions with intervals of 4-6 hours between the administration of the different substances (Innsbruck scheme of chemotherapy). In all cases within 6 days from the onset of this therapy the septic parameters turned to normal values. None of the 24 patients suffering from a severe course of urosepsis, all treated at the University Hospital of Urology in Innsbruck between 1980 and 1990, died.
TI  - Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis: a twenty-one-year experience.
AB  - We reviewed our experience with gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in neonates and infants from 1969 through 1989. Ninety-eight patients were identified. Their ages were from 1 day to 2 years with a median of 10 days. In 25 patients (26%), predisposing factors were identified, the most common of which were neural tube defects and urinary tract anomalies. The causative agents were Escherichia coli (53%), Klebsiella-Enterobacter species (16%), Citrobacter diversus (9%), Salmonella species (9%), Proteus mirabilis (4%), Serratia marcescens (3%), Bacteroides fragilis (3%), and Aeromonas species (2%). At the time of diagnosis, Gram-stained smears of cerebrospinal fluid revealed gram-negative bacilli in 61% of patients. The causative organism was cultured from blood obtained from 55% of patients, and 21% had positive urine culture results. The cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts ranged from 0 to 80,600 cells/mm3, and the cerebrospinal fluid/serum glucose concentration ratio was less than 0.5 in 72% of patients. Antimicrobial regimens varied greatly. After initiation of antibiotic therapy, an average of 3 days was needed for eradication of bacteria from cerebrospinal fluid. The case-fatality rate was 17%, and 61% of survivors had long-term sequelae that included seizure disorders, hydrocephalus, physical disability, developmental delay, and hearing loss.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Bacteriologic examinations of patients with burns].
AB  - Bacteriological studies were performed on 189 patients treated during 1985-1989.  800 samples were tested which were taken from various sites of burn wound (3-5 smears from a patient). Surface of burn amounted to 15-86% and degree of burn was IIb/III. In 772 samples, 2073 bacterial strains were found. Most frequent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31%) and Staphylococcus aureus (29%). Remaining strains consisted chiefly of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Serological typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried according to Fisher demonstrated dominance of immunotype T3.7 (43%). Staphylococcal strains were most frequently sensitive to group III phages and/or supplementary phages.
TI  - Microwave sterilization of enterobacteria.
AB  - A new method is described which makes it possible to treat metal materials with microwaves. In consequence scalpel blades as well as cover glasses contaminated with four species of bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were sterilized. With this method sterilization can be achieved quite rapidly (1.5-2 min). Scanning electron microscopy revealed a progressive alteration in the morphology of micro-organisms and this proved proportional to the microwave exposure time. Only in Proteus mirabilis were no modifications found, even after long periods of microwave exposure.
TI  - Potentiation of the in vitro activity of some antimicrobial agents against selected gram-negative bacteria by EDTA-tromethamine.
AB  - The in vitro synergistic effects of combinations of EDTA-tromethamine and six antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, nalidixic acid and sulphadimethoxine) on clinically isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were investigated. The antibacterial activity was assessed from the minimal inhibitory concentration for the antibiotics alone or in combination with EDTA-tromethamine. EDTA-tromethamine potentiated the antibacterial activity of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline and streptomycin up to four-fold. There were no significant or consistent synergistic effects with nalidixic acid or sulphadimethoxine.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis MR/P fimbriae: molecular cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the major fimbrial subunit gene.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis, produces several putative virulence determinants, among them, fimbriae. Principally, two fimbrial types are produced by this species: mannose-resistant/Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae and mannose-resistant/Klebsiella-like (MR/K) fimbriae. To isolate MR/P fimbrial gene sequences, a P. mirabilis cosmid library was screened by immunoblotting and by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated fimbrial polypeptide, ADQGHGTVKFVGSIIDAPCS. One clone, pMRP101, reacted strongly with a monoclonal antibody specific for MR/P fimbriae and with the DNA probe. This clone hemagglutinated both tannic acid-treated and untreated chicken erythrocytes with or without 50 mM D-mannose and was shown to be fimbriated by transmission electron microscopy. A 525-bp open reading frame, designated mrpA, predicted a 175-amino-acid polypeptide including a 23-amino-acid hydrophobic leader peptide. The unprocessed and processed polypeptides are predicted to be 17,909 and 15,689 Da, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the processed fimbrial subunit exactly matched amino acid residues 24 to 43 predicted by the mrpA nucleotide sequence. The MrpA polypeptide shares 57% amino acid sequence identity with SmfA, the major fimbrial subunit of Serratia marcescens mannose-resistant fimbriae.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis urease: transcriptional regulation by UreR.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, initiating the formation of urinary stones. The enzyme is critical for kidney colonization and the development of acute pyelonephritis. Urease is induced by urea and is not controlled by the nitrogen regulatory system (ntr) or catabolite repression. Purified whole-cell RNA from induced and uninduced cultures of P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli harboring cloned urease sequences was probed with a 4.2-kb BglI fragment from within the urease operon. Autoradiographs of slot blots demonstrated 4.2- and 5.8-fold increases, respectively, in urease-specific RNA upon induction with urea. Structural and accessory genes necessary for urease activity, ureD, A, B, C, E, and F, were previously cloned and sequenced (B. D. Jones and H. L. T. Mobley, J. Bacteriol. 171:6414-6422, 1989). A 1.2-kb EcoRV-BamHI restriction fragment upstream of these sequences confers inducibility upon the operon in trans. Nucleotide sequencing of this fragment revealed a single open reading frame of 882 nucleotides, designated ureR, which is transcribed in the direction opposite that of the urease structural and accessory genes and encodes a 293-amino-acid polypeptide predicted to be 33,415 Da in size. Autoradiographs of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptides obtained by in vitro transcription-translation of the PCR fragments carrying only ureR yielded a single band with an apparent molecular size of 32 kDa. Fragments carrying an in-frame deletion within ureR synthesized a truncated product. The predicted UreR amino acid sequence contains a potential helix-turn-helix motif and an associated AraC family signature and is similar to that predicted for a number of DNA-binding proteins, including E. coli proteins that regulate acid phosphatase synthesis (AppY), porin synthesis (EnvY), and rhamnose utilization (RhaR). These data suggest that UreR governs the inducibility of P. mirabilis urease.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefprozil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a fine granular form for pediatric use, was administered to children with bacterial infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) against the following 84 strains isolated from cases to which CFPZ was administered; 55 strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 49 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 29 strains of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including 10 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. MIC determination of these strains was done with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. In pharmacokinetic studies, serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were investigated using bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CFPZ was orally administered 30 minutes before meals to 9 children with ages ranging from 7 years and 1 month to 12 years and 3 months. Three groups of 3 children were tested with doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. In addition to the above, clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 160 cases consisting of children with ages ranging 5 months to 12 years and 5 months. A mean dose of 8.6 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses (130 cases of t.i.d. and 30 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 7 days. The 160 cases included 34 cases of pharyngitis, 5 cases of tonsillitis, 8 cases of acute bronchitis, 8 cases of pneumonia, 52 cases of scarlet fever, 4 cases of acute purulent otitis media, 47 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis and 1 case of posthitis. Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined in 166 cases, including 6 cases excluded from the evaluation of clinical efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. With regard to GPC, MICs of CFPZ against 2 strains of S. aureus were 0.78 or 1.56 micrograms/ml and CFPZ showed the second highest activity to MCIPC. MICs of CFPZ against 49 strains of S. pyogenes were all less than 0.025 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - Identification of gram-negative bacteria by isoelectric focusing of soluble cellular proteins.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, isolated from clinical specimens were disrupted by repeated freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. The samples were separated by isoelectric focusing using polyacrylamide gels. The resulting protein patterns showed clear differences between the three species and made identification possible.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - The effect of dexamethasone and endotoxin administration on biliary IgA and bacterial adherence.
AB  - Adherence of bacteria to the intestinal epithelial cell may be the crucial initiating event for invasion and translocation and is normally prevented by both immune (IgA) and nonimmune (mucus, peristalsis, desquamation) mucosal defense mechanisms. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of endotoxin administration on mucosal immunity and to define the role of glucocorticoids, commonly released during endotoxicosis, in this process. Thirty female Fisher rats were randomly assigned to three groups of 10 animals each. Group I (CONT), was fed rat chow and H2O ad lib., Group II (DEX) was administered 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously of dexamethasone, and Group III (ETX) was given 1 mg/kg of endotoxin. Twenty-four hours later animals were sacrificed and mesenteric lymph nodes and vigorously washed stool-free ceca were collected and cultured. Bile was collected and assayed for IgA from 5 animals in each group. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in secretory IgA was noted in animals treated with either dexamethasone or endotoxin (CONT = 332 +/- 42, DEX = 78 +/- 24, ETX = 68 +/- 16 micrograms/mg protein +/- SEM). No difference in S-IgA between animals in the dexamethasone-treated group and the endotoxin-treated group was noted (P = NS). A statistically significant increase (P < 0.001) in bacteria adherent to the cecal wall in both the dexamethasone-treated rats and the endotoxin-treated rats over that in = 7.5 +/- 0.8, CONT = 6.4 +/- 0.6 cfu/g(log10) +/- SD). Our results suggest that endotoxin or glucocorticoid administration results in significant bacterial adherence to the cecal mucosa and a decrease in IgA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. Of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). The organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. Of the organisms isolated, 77% were Gram positive cocci, 15% Gram negative rods and 8% Candida. No blockage of the stents occurred. All of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. None of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections while the stent remained in place. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. Clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. The high recovery rate of Gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. The findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with Gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.
TI  - Acute phlegmonous gastritis with mural abscess: CT diagnosis.
AB  
TI  - Survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the Royal London Hospital.
AB  - beta-Lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. This survey, performed between January and April, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. The distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. This increase was balanced by a decreased proportion of enterobacteria. Amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (especially), TEM-2, SHV-1 and OXA types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. Their frequency in Escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst Proteus mirabilis isolates. An apparent decrease in their frequency amongst Enterobacter cloacae isolates, from 48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. Plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of P. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. In the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of E. cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii, and in 2/170 P. aeruginosa isolates. These proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (P approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). Extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were found in 11/70 Klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. Ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced TEM-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified SHV-derived enzyme.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new heterocyclic structures: [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c] [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo [4', 5': 4,5] pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine.
AB  - Some derivatives of thiazolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine, pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[2,3-i]purine, [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4',5':4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1 (HSV-1), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Coxsackievirus B5 (CoxB5). The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses, mycetes and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited a modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - A descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  - Out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. Of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while Escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. The most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (30 cultures), E. faecalis-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (28), E. faecalis-P. aeruginosa (13), K. pneumoniae-P. aeruginosa (9), and E. coli-P. aeruginosa (9).
TI  - Cloning of a creatinase gene from Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli by using an indicator plate.
AB  - A genomic library of Pseudomonas putida DNA was constructed by using plasmid pBR322. Transformants of Escherichia coli in combination with Proteus mirabilis cells grown on creatinase test plates were screened for creatinase activity; transformants were considered positive for creatinase activity if a red-pink zone appeared around the colonies. One creatinase-positive clone was further analyzed, and the gene was reduced to a 2.7-kb DNA fragment. A unique protein band (with a molecular weight of approximately 50,000) was observed in recombinant E. coli by minicell analysis.
TI  - Composition of urinary calculi related to urinary tract infection.
AB  - The composition of 3,084 urinary calculi was determined using an infrared spectrophotometer. Mixed calcium oxalate-calcium phosphate stones were most frequently implicated. Of the urinary calculi analyzed 199 were associated with urinary tract infection. Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated (43 strains) and urease-producing organisms, such as Proteus mirabilis, were cultured from 40 patients. The core culture of 20 staghorn calculi yielded 15 isolates from 14 stones. There were 13 identical species isolated from the urine and stone specimens of 13 patients (65%), including 7 strains of P. mirabilis. These results suggest that cultures of urine specimens of urolithiasis patients, especially those with staghorn calculi, may help to elucidate the bacteriology of the stones.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction for detection of Leptospira spp. in clinical samples.
AB  - A sensitive assay for Leptospira spp., the causative agent of leptospirosis, was  developed on the basis of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A 331-bp sequence from the Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola rrs (16S) gene was amplified, and the PCR products were analyzed by DNA-DNA hybridization by using a 289-bp fragment internal to the amplified DNA. Specific PCR products also were obtained with DNA from the closely related nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa but not with DNA from other spirochetes, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia hermsii, Treponema denticola, Treponema pallidum, Spirochaeta aurantia, or more distant organisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Proteus mirabilis. The assay was able to detect as few as 10 bacteria. Leptospira DNA was detected in urine from experimentally infected mice. In addition, the test was found to be suitable for diagnosing leptospirosis in humans. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine from patients with leptospirosis were positive, whereas samples from control uninfected patients were negative.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of tosufloxacin against and uptake of tosufloxacin by outer membrane mutants of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of tosufloxacin and other quinolones against and apparent uptakes of tosufloxacin and other quinolones by outer membrane mutants of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium were studied. The hydrophobicity of tosufloxacin was nearly equal to that of ofloxacin or lower than those of sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. OmpF- and OmpC-deficient E. coli and 40-kDa porin-deficient P. mirabilis mutants were twofold more susceptible to tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin but two- to fourfold less susceptible to other quinolones than their parent strains. In S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide-deficient (rough) mutants, the differences in susceptibility to tosufloxacin were similar to those to sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. The apparent uptake of tosufloxacin by intact cells was increased in porin-deficient mutants compared with that by their parent strain. These results suggest that the permeation route of tosufloxacin across the outer membrane is different from that of other fluoroquinolones and that tosufloxacin may permeate mainly through the nonporin pathway, presumably phospholipid bilayers. However, this characteristic is independent of the hydrophobicity of the molecule.
TI  - Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody to the O-acetylated peptidoglycan of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (PmPG5-3) specific for the O-acetylated peptidoglycan of Proteus mirabilis 19 was produced by an NS-1 myeloma cell line and purified from ascites fluid by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography. The monoclonal antibody (an immunoglobulin M) was characterized by a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to be equally specific for both insoluble and soluble O-acetylated peptidoglycan but weakly recognized chemically de-O-acetylated P. mirabilis peptidoglycan, the non-O-acetylated peptidoglycans from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and the peptidoglycan monosaccharide precursors N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid dipeptide. The monoclonal antibody did not react with D-alanine or lipopolysaccharide isolated from P. mirabilis. Based on this evidence, the binding epitope on the P. mirabilis peptidoglycan is predicted to be linear and to comprise the glycan backbone, including both the N- and O-acetyl moieties. Monoclonal antibody PmPG5-3 was used to localize the O acetylation of the P. mirabilis peptidoglycan by immunoelectron microscopy. Murein sacculi of P. mirabilis were heavily and randomly labelled with the immunogold, whereas very little labelling and no labelling were observed on the sacculi isolated from de-O-acetylated P. mirabilis and E. coli, respectively. Based on the apparent pattern of immunogold labelling, a physiological role for peptidoglycan O acetylation in P. mirabilis is proposed.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in acute spinal cord injury.
AB  - Preservation of renal function and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients. METHOD--The hospital courses of fifty such patients admitted to our Rehabilitation Department from August 1989 to August 1990 were studied according to age, gender, spinal cord injury level, method of bladder drainage on admission and upon discharge, type of urinary tract infections and results of bladder management were documented. RESULTS--Forty-five men and ten women were studied. Mean age of males was forty and females, forty-two. The commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident followed by accidents at work place. Fifty-three percent had cervical cord injuries, thirteen percent thoracolumbar and sixteen percent lumbo sacral injuries. Seventy-eight percent had an indwelling foley catheter upon admission. Upon discharge eighty-two percent of spinal cord injury patients were able to void with/without tapping and compression. There were a total of one hundred and forty-three urinary tract infections in our study group. All positive urine cultures had greater than or equal to 100,000 CFU/ml. The commonest organisms causing urinary tract infection were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION--For bacteria to produce disease in the urinary tract, they must gain access and colonise the uroepithelium, induce inflammation and tissue damage. The indwelling catheter provides a direct access to the uroepithelium, making bacteriuria and subsequent infection inevitable. Impaired voiding and sensation in spinal cord injury patients provides an excellent reservoir for the multiplication of bacteria, tissue invasion and recurrent urinary tract infection. Hence current methods of neurogenic bladder management have to focus on attaining a catheter-free status as soon as possible; relevant antibiotic therapy and careful attention to individual urinary tract problems to reduce morbidity and improve on spinal cord injury patient's future. Although spinal cord injury patients are described, the material covered is applicable to any type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
TI  - Brain abscess in infants.
AB  - Brain abscesses are rare in infants and their clinical presentation is specific for this age group. Seven cases of brain abscess in infants aged 2-11 months are reported. The underlying cause was meningitis in four, sepsis in two, and unknown in one. Gram-negative organisms were cultured in 6 patients. The abscess size was 5 cm or more in five cases; in four there were multiple lesions. Two abscesses were aspirated and irrigated; four particularly large lesions were drained and repeatedly aspirated and irrigated. One craniotomy was done. There were two deaths, one in the postoperative period and the other 6 months after discharge. Follow-up information is available for four children, showing a good result in only one of them. Formation of an abscess should be diagnosed early, and close ultrasound monitoring or CT scanning in infants with bacterial meningitis and sepsis is essential. The prognosis in cases in which large/multiple abscesses develop is poor.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - Klebsiella aerogenes urease gene cluster: sequence of ureD and demonstration that four accessory genes (ureD, ureE, ureF, and ureG) are involved in nickel metallocenter biosynthesis.
AB  - The region located immediately upstream from the Klebsiella aerogenes urease structural genes was sequenced and shown to possess an open reading frame capable of encoding a 29.8-kDa peptide. Deletions were generated in this gene, denoted ureD, and in each of the genes (ureE, ureF, and ureG) located immediately downstream of the three structural genes. Transformation of the mutated plasmids into Escherichia coli resulted in high levels of urease expression, but the enzyme was inactive (deletions in ureD, ureF, or ureG) or only partially active (deletions in ureE). Ureases were purified from the recombinant cells and shown to be identical to control enzyme when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, in every case the activity levels correlated to nickel contents as analyzed by atomic absorption analysis. UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG peptides were tentatively identified by gel electrophoretic comparison of mutant and control cell extracts, by in vivo expression of separately cloned genes, or by in vitro transcription-translation analyses; the assignments were confirmed for UreE and UreG by amino-terminal sequencing. The latter peptides (apparent M(r)s, 23,900 and 28,500) were present at high levels comparable to those of the urease subunits, whereas the amounts of UreF (apparent M(r), 27,000) and UreD (apparent M(r), 29,300) were greatly reduced, perhaps because of the lack of good ribosome binding sites in the regions upstream of these open reading frames. These results demonstrate that all four accessory genes are necessary for the functional incorporation of the urease metallocenter.
TI  - Purification of recombinant Helicobacter pylori urease apoenzyme encoded by ureA  and ureB.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative, microaerophilic, spiral-shaped bacterium, is an etiologic agent of human gastritis and peptic ulceration and is highly restricted to the gastric mucosa of humans. Urease, synthesized at up to 6% of the soluble cell protein, hydrolyzes urea, thereby releasing ammonia, which may neutralize acid, allowing survival of the bacterium and initial colonization of the gastric mucosa. The urease protein is encoded by two subunit genes, ureA and ureB; however, accessory genes are necessary for enzyme activity. H. pylori urease genes were isolated from a cosmid gene bank and subcloned on a 5.8-kb Sau3A partial fragment carrying ureCDAB, corresponding to four open reading frames described by A. Labigne, V. Cussac, and P. Courcoux (J. Bacteriol. 173:1920-1931, 1991). Clones were confirmed as ureas gene sequences by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The recombinant enzyme was purified from the soluble protein of French press lysates of Escherichia coli DH5 alpha(pHP402) by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Phenyl-Sepharose, Mono-Q, and Superose 6 resins. Fractions containing a catalytically inactive apoenzyme were identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by using antisera to native UreA (29.5 kDa) and UreB (66 kDa). Purified recombinant urease was indistinguishable from native enzyme on a Superose 6 column and on Coomassie blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The protein reacted specifically on Western blots (immunoblots) with anti-UreA and anti-UreB antibodies and was recognized with an intensity equal to that of the native enzyme in an ELISA using human sera. Clones containing only ureA and ureB also produced an assembled but inactive enzyme. Enzyme activity was not restored by in trans complementation with cloned urease accessory gene sequences from Proteus mirabilis or Morganella morganii. H. pylori urease genes (ureCDAB) subcloned into pACYC184 were also not complemented with any of 1,000 cosmid clones containing H. pylori chromosomal sequences. However, larger clones containing 4.5 kb of DNA downstream of ureB synthesized catalytically active urease when grown in minimal medium. These data indicate that the ureA and ureB genes encoding H. pylori urease are transcribed and translated in E. coli and that these genes alone are sufficient for the synthesis and assembly of the native size enzyme. Genes downstream of ureB, however, are necessary for production of a catalytically active urease.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - [Effect of pH on preferential antibacterial-activity of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)].
AB  - Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chelating agent, was examined for the antibacterial activity against 15 species of bacteria by treating with a 10mM solution at pH adjusted to 5.0, 7.0 or 9.0. All bacterial species tested were classified into three groups; tentatively named the pH5 EDTA-sensitive group comprising Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus, the pH9 EDTA-sensitive group comprising Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the EDTA-nonsensitive group comprising Proteus mirabilis. The EDTA-sensitivity grouping may be used as a tool for preferential decontamination of certain bacteria in live edible fishes, although further experiments are needed to characterize more strains and also species of bacteria.
TI  - Effects of cefaclor, cefetamet and Ro 40-6890 on inflammatory responses of human  granulocytes.
AB  - The effect of three cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefaclor and Ro 40-6890) upon human granulocytes and their ability to modulate the chemiluminescence response, phagocytose, kill bacteria and generate leukotrienes was studied. In the presence of the cephalosporins there was a significant increase in phagocytosis of Escherichia coli. The bactericidal activity of human granulocytes for several other bacteria was also enhanced. Cefetamet and cefaclor increased the chemiluminescence response of human neutrophils to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis in contrast to Ro 40-68790, which decreased the chemiluminescence response. The cephalosporins decreased the synthesis of leukotrienes from human neutrophils after stimulation with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These data emphasize the immunomodulatory functions of various cephalosporins on cells involved in host defence.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - Potential for local and systemic bacterial infection in some occupational groups  in Benin City, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many Third World countries may not have adequate facilities for rapid sensitivity testing of antibiotics as an aid to diagnosis and chemotherapy. It may therefore be valuable to relate bacterial carriage on the skin to type of work a person does. METHODS: Given areas of skin in workers from 10 occupational groups were sampled. The bacteria obtained were analyzed after growth on appropriate media. The sensitivity profiles of potential pathogens isolated from these groups, as well as of those (Staphylococcus aureus only) isolated from patients with certified infections, were carried out and the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus constituted the most widely and frequently isolated potential pathogen. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species were also frequent colonizers of skin. There was a statistical relationship between work type and overall prevalence of bacteria on skin (p less than 0.01). Most isolates of the work groups were highly sensitive to gentamicin and cefuroxine but not to penicillin G, ampicillin, and trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole; isolates from infected persons were generally more resistant than were the community-acquired ones. CONCLUSIONS: A relationship may exist between the types of bacteria carried on the skin and the type of work in which a person is engaged.
TI  - Review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/mL; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/mL; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/mL) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. Among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. For anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including Clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Eubacterium. The activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. In these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and C. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary antibody, and survival in the institutionalized elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical status of elderly institutionalized subjects with  asymptomatic bacteriuria and normal urinary antibody to those with elevated urinary antibody to the major outer membrane of Escherichia coli. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Long term facility for the elderly. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 63 elderly subjects, 26% of those resident in the institution, aged 78.8 +/- 8.4 years with urine specimens collected and stored in 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in clinical or functional status, demographic features, and outcome during 3-years follow-up between bacteriuric subjects with normal and elevated urine antibody. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects had no bacteriuria, and 12 had infrequent, intermittent bacteriuria; 38 (60%) had persistent bacteriuria, including four with frequent, intermittent infections. In the persistently bacteriuric group, 18 (47%) had persistently elevated urine antibody. There was no significant differences between bacteriuric residents with normal vs elevated urine antibody in clinical or functional status, age, duration of residence, or infecting organisms. However, 11 of 20 in the cohort with normal urine antibody were alive at 3 years compared to 3 of 18 with elevated urine antibody (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly institutionalized subjects with persistent bacteriuria and elevated urine antibody have decreased survival compared to those with normal urine antibody. No differences in underlying illness or clinical course to explain this survival difference were identified.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in a university hospital in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of aztreonam were evaluated in an open trial at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 45 critically-ill adult patients were enrolled in the study. All patients with documented Gram-negative infection were treated with aztreonam as monotherapy. Antibiotics active against only Gram-positive and/or anaerobic organisms were allowed. Twenty cases were clinically evaluable. Eleven had lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia), 3 had urinary tract infections, and 6 had septicemia. Clinical signs and symptoms, cultures and other laboratory profiles were assessed prior to treatment, at 4-6 days during treatment and within 2-3 days of the end of therapy (usually 7-15 days). Nineteen out of 20 (95%) had a satisfactory clinical response. All cases with septicemia and urinary tract infections were microbiologically cured. The overall microbiological response rate was 90%. Fifty-five percent of all infections were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two patients with Gram-negative pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa did not respond microbiologically to aztreonam therapy. No serious adverse events requiring discontinuation of aztreonam therapy were reported. No mortality occurred.
TI  - Intestinal bacterial flora, intestinal pathology, and lipopolysaccharide-induced  translocation of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The primary aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism and significance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced translocation of intestinal bacteria. Female Swiss Webster mice were purchased from two different animal suppliers. Twenty-four hours following parenteral LPS, mice from both suppliers had noticeable morbidity and mortality. However, intestinal pathology, gram-negative bacterial overgrowth, and increased bacterial translocation was noted in mice purchased from one supplier but not the other. Mice with increased translocation also had overgrowth of cecal gram-negative bacilli, i.e., 10(10) per gram of cecum following parenteral LPS; in contrast, mice without LPS-induced bacterial translocation had 1,000- to 10,000-fold fewer cecal gram-negative bacilli. Additional groups of mice with increased bacterial translocation were also sacrificed two and 6 hr after parenteral LPS; morbidity and intestinal pathology were evident without a corresponding increase in bacterial translocation. Separate groups of these mice were also injected with platelet activating factor, resulting in intestinal pathology similar to that noted with parenteral LPS, but no increase in bacterial translocation. Thus parenteral LPS was consistently associated with morbidity and mortality but not with intestinal pathology, enteric bacterial overgrowth, or increased bacterial translocation.
TI  - Ofloxacin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of uncomplicated  urinary tract infection.
AB  - A multicenter randomized study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of ofloxacin with that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adults. Patients were randomized to receive either oral ofloxacin 200 mg daily for three days (102 patients), or oral TMP/SMX 160 mg/800 mg twice daily for seven days (100 patients). The pathogen was eradicated in 73 (97.3%) of the 75 evaluable patients receiving ofloxacin and in 66 (97.1%) of the 68 evaluable patients receiving TMP/SMX. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. More urinary pathogens were susceptible to ofloxacin than to TMP/SMX, although this difference was not statistically significant. The clinical cure rate for patients receiving ofloxacin was 93.3%, with 4% improved and 2.7% failed. For patients receiving TMP/SMX, the clinical cure rate was 86.4%, with 12.1% improved and 1.5% failed. Side effects were reported by 29.7% of the patients receiving ofloxacin and by 40.4% of the patients receiving TMP/SMX. Drug-related adverse experiences, as determined by the investigators, occurred in 5% of the ofloxacin patients and in 15.2% of the TMP/SMX patients, a statistically significant difference. No patients receiving ofloxacin, compared with three patients receiving TMP/SMX, discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. These results indicate that short-course ofloxacin is as effective as TMP/SMX in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Ofloxacin therapy is also better tolerated than TMP/SMX.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases by the rapid ATB E technique. Value of the API V2.1.1 expert system].
AB  - Twenty-two extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing strains of enterobacteriaceae recovered in the authors' hospital were tested using the Rapid ATB E coupled with the API V2.1.1. expert system. The expert system detected 90.9% of ESBL-producing strains. Two strains producing a SHV2 and a CTX1, respectively, escaped detection by the expert system despite concomitant resistance to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Community acquired urinary tract infections in Singapore: a microbiological study.
AB  - We studied 214 patients with culture proven community acquired infections. A total of 219 organisms were isolated, of which 68.2% were Escherichia coli, 10.1% Klebsiella sp and 5.5% Proteus mirabilis. Gram positive cocci accounted for 10.5% of organisms isolated. The majority of organisms isolated were sensitive to nalidixic acid (81.1%), nitrofurantoin (80.7%), cephalexin (74.7%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (65.0%). Resistance to ampicillin was common (49.8%), as such the use of ampicillin in community acquired urinary tract infections will result in a high failure rate.
TI  - Comparison of the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections: results from a multicenter study.
AB  - Lomefloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) were compared in the treatment of adults with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The study was conducted as a multicenter, controlled, prospectively randomized, single-blind study in five countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela). A total of 254 patients were enrolled: 129 in the lomefloxacin group and 125 in the TMP/SMX group. Patients received either 400 mg lomefloxacin orally once daily or 160 mg/800 mg TMP/SMX orally twice daily for 7-10 days. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were the pathogens most frequently isolated. At 5-9 days post-therapy, satisfactory bacteriologic results were noted in 98.4% of patients treated with lomefloxacin and in 95.8% of patients in the TMP/SMX group (p = 0.2153). Clinical success 5-9 days post-therapy was noted in 99.2% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and in 98.3% of patients in the TMP/SMX group (p = 0.5138). Adverse events probably related to treatment occurred in 6% of those treated with lomefloxacin and in 7% of patients treated with TMP/SMX. Once-daily oral lomefloxacin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - Anti-Proteus antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis same-sexed sibships.
AB  - One hundred and forty-two RA patients and 121 of their healthy same-sexed siblings were tested for antibodies (Abs) to Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli by indirect immunofluorescence. Eighty-five individuals had active RA (CRP greater than 10 mg/l) and 57 inactive RA. The anti-Proteus Ab titre in the active RA group was significantly higher than in the inactive RA and non-RA group (P less than 0.0001 in both cases). Anti-Proteus Abs were significantly elevated in 30 individuals with active RA compared with their healthy HLA-identical same-sexed siblings (P less than 0.001). In 42 HLA-DR4 positive and 15 HLA-DR4 negative active RA patients, the Ab titre was non-significantly higher in the former group. Anti-E. coli Abs were not significantly elevated in any of the groups. Longitudinal data on 36 RA patients demonstrated a significant positive correlation between changes in CRP and changes in anti-Proteus antibody titres (r = 0.52, P less than 0.001). These observations require an explanation.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - We have endeavoured to determine whether there is any difference in the bacteriological pattern of UTI and the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the pathogens concerned between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Over a period of 1 year, a total of 287 diabetic patients (221 females and 66 males) with community-acquired and nosocomial urinary tract infections were studied. There were 265 patients (228 females and 37 males) without any predisposition to urinary tract infections (UTI) and who served as controls. Although Escherichia coli was the predominant organism in community-acquired UTI in diabetic patients, it was found significantly less than in the non-diabetic population (P less than 0.005). The percentage of Klebsiella species causing community-acquired UTI in diabetic patients was significantly higher than in non-diabetics (P less than 0.005). The antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the organisms in the two groups, however, were not significantly different. The organisms isolated from nosocomial UTI in diabetics showed a significantly greater preponderance of Klebsiella spp. and a significantly lower percentage of E. coli when compared to community-acquired UTI in diabetics (P less than 0.005). Klebsiella spp. in nosocomial UTI of diabetics showed an overall increase in resistance to antibiotics. At least a quarter of the isolates of Klebsiella spp. in nosocomial UTI were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Patients with diabetes mellitus appear to have an increased incidence of Klebsiella spp. as the pathogen in both community-acquired and nosocomial UTI. Antibiotic resistance in the organisms isolated from nosocomial UTI is greater than that related to community-acquired UTI in diabetic patients.
TI  - Detection by ELISA of low numbers of Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli  in mixed cultures after growth in the presence of mitomycin C.
AB  - Techniques currently available to detect Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-producing Escherichia coli lack sensitivity or require specialised equipment and facilities, and in some cases detect only strains belonging to serotype O157. We have used an ELISA technique, capable of detecting both SLTI and SLTII with crude P1 glycoprotein from hydatid cysts, in combination with enhancement of toxin production by culture with mitomycin C. Supernates of Tryptone Soya Broth cultures containing mitomycin C 200 ng/ml were tested for SLTII. For SLTI, cell lysates pre-treated with polymyxin B were tested. In tests with E. coli O157:H7 in mixed culture with E. coli strain C600 alone, or with E. coli C600, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis, SLTI could be detected when the proportion of toxigenic organisms represented 1% of the mixture, and SLTII when the proportion was 0.025%. When faecal samples with added E. coli O157:H7 were examined in this system, SLTII-producing strains were detected when they comprised less than 0.1% of the coliform population. This technique is a sensitive and specific assay for detecting low numbers of SLT-producing organisms in mixed culture such as occurs in cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome and haemorrhagic colitis.
TI  - Modulation of effects of lipopolysaccharide on macrophages by a major outer membrane protein of Proteus mirabilis as measured in a chemiluminescence assay.
AB  - Our previous studies have shown that a major protein isolated from purified cell  walls of Proteus mirabilis (39-kDa protein) is a strong modulator of the specific immune responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from this bacterium. When the protein is mixed with LPS before immunization of mice, the responses of antibody-producing cells specific for LPS are greatly enhanced and converted predominantly to the immunoglobulin G isotype. In the present study, the immunomodulating effects of the 39-kDa protein were tested at the level of interaction of LPS with macrophages. Activation of macrophages was determined by measuring the production of oxygen radicals in a chemiluminescence assay with lucigenin as the amplifier. LPS from P. mirabilis induced strong oxidative metabolism in both peritoneal and bone marrow-derived murine macrophages. These responses were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by mixing LPS with increasing amounts of the protein. In contrast, bovine serum albumin and methylated bovine serum albumin enhanced the response of macrophages dramatically when complexed with LPS. The inhibiting activity of the 39-kDa protein was also observed with LPS from Escherichia coli K-12.
TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: experience in 36 cases.
AB  - A retrospective study of 36 patients with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis who  underwent nephrectomy at our hospital was performed. The disease occurred most frequently in middle-aged women with a history of recurrent urinary tract disorder. There were 2 cases of focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, 2 associated with emphysematous pyelonephritis, 2 that manifested as fistula formation between the colon or skin, and 1 with deep sinus formation into the hip joint that presented as septic arthritis. Flank pain and fever were the most frequent complaints. Escherichia coli (67%) and Proteus mirabilis (26%) were the most common organisms isolated from the voided urine, kidney and blood stream. Cephalothin plus gentamicin or tobramycin were the drugs of choice before surgical intervention.
TI  - Effectiveness of cefetamet pivoxil in the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil was investigated in an open, randomized comparative study involving a total of 37 children with acute pyelonephritis, whose ages ranged from 2 to 14 years. The patients received either 10 mg/kg (n = 18) or 20 mg/kg (n = 8) cefetamet pivoxil twice daily, or 30-50 mg/kg amoxycillin/clavulanic acid three times daily (n = 11) for a period of 7-10 days. Escherichia coli was the main causative agent isolated in 28 (75.7%) of the patients; other pathogens included Proteus mirabilis (three patients). Proteus species (one patient), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two patients), Pseudomonas diminuta (one patient) and mixed infections (three patients). No differences in the overall treatment outcome could be observed between the treatment regimens used and, at the end of treatment, all pathogens were eradicated with neither relapse, nor persistence of the isolated pathogen, nor reinfection occurring. The clinical signs and symptoms had subsided in all patients at treatment end and the tolerability of the trial drugs was found to be satisfactory with no premature treatment withdrawal required. It is concluded that cefetamet pivoxil in the standard twice-daily dose of 10 mg/kg was equally effective and as well tolerated as 20 mg/kg cefetamet pivoxil given twice daily or 30-50 mg/kg amoxycillin/clavulanic acid given three times daily.
TI  - O-acetylated peptidoglycan: its occurrence, pathobiological significance, and biosynthesis.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls and their structural units, particularly peptidoglycan, induce a vast variety of biological effects in host organisms. The pathobiological effects of peptidoglycan are greatly enhanced by various modifications and substitutions to its basic composition and structure. One such modification is the presence of acetyl moieties at the C-6 hydroxyl group of N-acetylmuramyl residues, and to date, 11 species of eubacteria, including some important human pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, are known to possess O-acetylated peptidoglycan. This review addresses the influence of O-acetylation of peptidoglycan on its resistance to degradation both in vitro and in vivo, the clinical importance of the modification, and the currently held views on the pathway for its biosynthesis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin BK-218.
AB  - BK-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. BK-218 was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher MICs. BK-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. Moderate BK-218 activity was observed against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (MIC90, 1 mg/l), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 2 mg/l), and Proteus mirabilis (MIC90, 2 mg/l). The following organisms were generally BK-218-resistant (MIC90, greater than 16 mg/l): Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus, Serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Comparison of three-day temafloxacin with seven-day ciprofloxacin treatment of urinary tract infections in women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Temafloxacin is a new broad-spectrum arylfluoroquinolone antimicrobial with an extended serum half-life. METHODS: In this large, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial, 404 women with acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive temafloxacin 400 mg once daily for 3 days, or ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were repeated at 4 to 5 days after initiation of treatment, at the end of therapy, and at 5 to 9 days posttreatment. One hundred fifteen patients who received temafloxacin and 105 patients who received ciprofloxacin met the eligibility criteria for efficacy evaluation. The predominant urinary pathogens were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. No pretherapy isolate was resistant to either study drug. RESULTS: Bacteriologic eradication was observed in 112 (97%) of 115 women treated with temafloxacin and 101 (96%) of 105 women treated with ciprofloxacin. Clinical cure rates at 5 to 9 days posttreatment were 90% (the remaining 10% improved) with temafloxacin and 95% (the remaining 5% improved) with ciprofloxacin. Adverse effects associated with treatment occurred in 24 (12%) women who received temafloxacin and 31 (15%) women who received ciprofloxacin. Headache (2% with temafloxacin and 2% with ciprofloxacin), nausea (3% with temafloxacin and 6% with ciprofloxacin), and somnolence (4% with temafloxacin and 3% with ciprofloxacin) were reported most often. Only three and five patients who were treated with temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively, discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a 3-day treatment regimen using a single daily 400-mg dose of temafloxacin was found to be as effective as a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin in women with acute uncomplicated UTI.
TI  - [Evaluation of the ATB 32 E system for automated identification of Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - A new automated system ensuring identification of Enterobacteriaceae within four  hours was evaluated using 269 routine isolates, comparatively with the techniques routinely used in the laboratory. The ATB 32 E system correctly identified 96% (258/270) of strains and yielded incorrect results for 4% (11/269) of strains. ATB 32 E is a reliable system which is easy to use in everyday laboratory work.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Recombination and UV resistance of Escherichia coli with the cloned recA and recBCD genes of Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis: evidence for an advantage of intraspecies combination of P. mirabilis RecA protein and RecBCD enzyme.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, constituents of the main recombination pathway are provided  by the genes recA (RecA protein) and recBCD (RecBCD enzyme). Recombination in conjugation experiments and repair of UV damage of E. coli mutants deleted for recA, for recBCD or for recA plus recBCD were restored, although to different degrees, by the cloned recA and recBCD genes from Serratia marcescens or Proteus mirabilis. When both recombination enzymes were from the same species, repair and recombination efficiencies had the order E. coli greater than S. marcescens greater than P. mirabilis. However, the P. mirabilis recA plus recBCD genes resulted in higher levels of repair and recombination than those obtained with one component from P. mirabilis (recA or recBCD) and the other from E. coli or S. marcescens. The data provide evidence for the similarity of RecABCD pathways of recombination among enteric bacteria and suggest an in vivo advantage of an intraspecies combination of P. mirabilis RecA protein and RecBCD enzyme over interspecies combinations. This could point to a cooperation between these basic recombination enzymes. The molecular processes which could be involved are discussed.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a tryptic peptide of Borrelia burgdorferi flagellin, which reduces cross-reactivity in immunoblots and ELISA.
AB  - In man the early immune response in Lyme disease is primarily directed against the endoflagellin antigen. Isolated flagellar protein of Borrelia burgdorferi suggests itself as a suitable test antigen. However, cross-reactivity between flagellins of B. burgdorferi, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated by immunoblotting and ELISA with polyclonal rabbit-hyperimmune-sera. Tryptic cleavage of recombinant B. burgdorferi 41 kDa flagellin, expressed in E. coli, produced a peptide fragment which was recognized exclusively by antisera to Borrelia species. This peptide was designated as the 14 kDa fragment due to its migratory behaviour in SDS-PAGE. The fragment is part of the variable region of the flagellin, as proven by amino acid sequencing. The flagellin peptide was employed as an antigen in ELISA and immunoblot assays, testing the polyclonal sera mentioned above. The specificity was superior to that obtained with the intact recombinant flagellin.
TI  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry for bacterial chemotaxonomy: influence of culture age, growth temperature, gaseous environment and extraction technique.
AB  - Extracted phospholipids of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae were examined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry which yielded major peaks between m/z 225 and 761. The result of extracting freeze-dried or 'wet' cells showed that freeze-drying may be omitted although weighing of dried cells offers a useful means of standardizing the extraction procedure. Anaerobic growth quantitatively altered the chemical finger-print as a result of increase in ratio of saturated: unsaturated carboxylic acids. Growth temperature also affected profiles over the temperature range 24-45 degrees C. A less drastic influence on mass spectra was culture age, over the range 16-48 h. Comparison of spectra was possible with Pearson's coefficient of linear correlation which yielded the following values: wet and lyophilized cells, r = 0.97; aerobic and anaerobic growth, r = 0.82; 24 degrees C and 45 degrees C, r = 0.76; 16 h and 48 h, r = 0.95. These results show that although quantitative differences do occur between spectra for the same organism prepared in different ways, they are less than interspecies variation, e.g. with E. coli and P. mirabilis, r = 0.46. Any differences which are due preparation method can be overcome by standardization of technique.
TI  - Cefodizime given once daily for the treatment of upper urinary tract infections and complicated lower urinary tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy of cefodizime (CDZ) in upper urinary tract infections (UUTI) and complicated lower urinary tract infections (LUTI) was assessed by analysis of the combined results of five clinical trials. Doses of CDZ 1 g i.m. daily, 1 x 2 g i.v. or i.m. and 2 x 2 g i.v. were investigated; comparative agents were cefuroxime 3 x 1.5 g and ceftizoxime 1 x 2 g. Median duration of treatment was seven days. A total of 544 patients, 61% of whom had UUTI, entered the studies. Four hundred twenty-two patients were evaluable clinically and 375 bacteriologically. The most frequent pathogen at baseline was Escherichia coli, followed by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Both clinical and bacteriological cure rates were above 90% in all study groups. The dosage of 1 x 2 g CDZ is recommended for the treatment of UUTI and complicated LUTI.
TI  - [The hydrophobicity of gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with inflammatory and suppurative-destructive lung diseases].
AB  - Hydrophobic properties of 11 enterobacterial strains and 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patient with inflammatory and purulent destructive diseases of the lungs were studied. The hydrophobic properties of the isolated bacteria were determined by the method of salting out with ammonium sulfate. A high correlation (r = 0.56) between the above-mentioned properties of gram-negative bacteria and their isolation rate from patients with destructive diseases was established. The hydrophobic properties of bacteria were supposed to be of importance in the process of the colonization of pulmonary tissues with bacterial flora.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Bacteroides fragilis group in rat intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  - Attempts were made to study the pathogenicity of some strains of Bacteroides fragilis group in the rat intra-abdominal abscess model. Multiple intraabdominal abscesses were produced in 50 to 70% of animals when an inoculum containing 10(9) CFU/ml of any of the five species of Bacteroides fragilis group was injected. Rising homologous antibody titers determined by indirect fluorescent antibody test were observed till the 3rd week when tested last, indirectly confirming the multiplication of the organisms as also evident by viable count of bacteria in the abscesses. In some cases in addition to inoculated organisms some intestinal bacteria like Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus spp. were also recovered from the abscess pus. Studies with the electron microscope showed presence of capsular polysaccharide only in Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. It was doubtful in Bacteroides distasonis and absent in Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides vulgatus, suggesting that virulence factor beside the capsular polysaccharide may be playing a role. Further studies are required to investigate the virulence factor responsible for the pathogenicity of noncapsulated species.
TI  - The effect of repeated instillations of antiseptics on catheter-associated urinary tract infections: a study in a physical model of the catheterized bladder.
AB  - The activity of three antiseptic bladder washout solutions was examined in a physical model of the catheterized bladder. Tests were performed against cultures of four common urinary tract pathogens that had established themselves in the model and colonized the surfaces with biofilm. Double instillations of chlorhexidine (0.02% w/v) at 6-h intervals failed to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii from the bladder model. Escherichia coli, however, was susceptible to a second instillation provided that it was performed within 12 h. Supplementing chlorhexidine with EDTA and TRIS potentiated its activity against E. coli. Mandelic acid (1.0% w/v) was the most effective of the agents, double instillations eliminating all but Pr. mirabilis infections.
TI  - Effects of bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on the urokinase and sialidase (neuraminidase) activity.
AB  - It has been hypothesized that urinary urokinase and sialidase may play a role in  urolithiasis. If these theories have substance it is to be expected that microorganisms may also affect these enzymes, since the association between urinary tract infection and renal stone formation is well known. It is generally assumed that Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus albus, which produce the urea-splitting enzyme urease, are responsible for stone formation. However, the importance of non-urease-producing microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus) in urolithiasis is unclear. Spectrophotometric studies were therefore devised to clarify this problem. Microorganisms associated with infection-induced stones (Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) respectively inhibited the urokinase and stimulated the sialidase activity. In contrast, microorganisms which were not associated with infection stones (Bacillus subtilis) had significantly less effect on urokinase and sialidase activity. This study may explain infection-induced stone formation and could open a completely new line of research.
TI  - Susceptibility of recent clinical isolates to temafloxacin (A-63004) and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of 1008 strains of recent clinical isolates was determined against the new aryl fluoroquinolone temafloxacin (T-167, A-63004) ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, oxacillin and vancomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of temafloxacin in micrograms/ml required for > or = 90% isolates were 0.13-0.5 for enterobacter, 0.03-0.25 for Escherichia coli, 0.12-0.5 for Klebsiella, 0.5-1.0 for Proteus mirabilis, 0.12-0.5 for Morganella morganii, 0.03-0.12 for Salmonella, 0.25-1.0 for Serratia marcescens, 0.03-0.12 for Shigella, 0.06-4.0 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.06-0.12 for Aeromonas hydrophila, 0.12-0.5 for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.12-1.0 for coagulase negative staphylococci and 4.0-8.0 for enterococci. The antibacterial activity of temafloxacin was comparable or superior to other drugs tested against most organisms. However, Xanthomonas malthophilia was relatively more susceptible to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, and temafloxacin had significantly high antibacterial activity against enterococci as compared to other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate in Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyrA.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the cloned Escherichia coli wild-type gyrA gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for DNA gyrase A-mediated quinolone resistance. The results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of Gram-negative species including E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The use of an arithmetical MIC series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening for the detection of altered gyrase A. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that DNA gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase A-mediated resistance can occur in all.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to pefloxacin and 14 antibiotics].
AB  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin against 782 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients (July-September 1991) in Wroclaw was compared with that of 14 antibiotics (4 aminoglycosides and 10 beta-lactamase). The most susceptible to pefloxacin were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (96.0%), Klebsiella (94.4%), Proteus mirabilis (93.8%) and Escherichia coli (92.7%). The least susceptible proved to be: nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (46.5%), and among them Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3% weakly sensitive, 0% sensitive strains). It was found that over 80% of Gram-negative rods were susceptible to pefloxacin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The most active against staphylococci were netilmicin (92.6%), pefloxacin (89.4%) and amikacin (82.5%).
TI  - Spectrum and susceptibility of pathogens causing acute uncomplicated lower UTI in females and its correlation to bacteriologic outcome after single dose therapy with fosfomycin trometamol versus ofloxacin/co-trimoxazole.
AB  - In a multicentric study comparing oral single-dose therapy of fosfomycin trometamol (3 g as fosfomycin) versus co-trimoxazole (1.92 g) or ofloxacin (200 mg) as many as possible of the pathogens were sent to and analysed in a central laboratory. The pathogens were identified and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of fosfomycin, trimethoprim alone and in combination with sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid, and cephadroxil were determined. The eradication of pathogens (cfu < 10(3)/ml at one week after single-dose therapy) was analysed according to species and MIC of the antibiotic used. Urine cultures of 349 patients were analysed. Escherichia coli was the predominating species followed by staphylococci and Proteus mirabilis. Enterococci were mostly found in mixed culture. Baseline pathogens of monoinfections were eradicated in 87.1%, in 88.9% and in 86.4% of 284 patients treated with fosfomycin trometamol, co-trimoxazole and ofloxacin, respectively. The MICs of the five antibacterial agents and the two antibiotic combinations for 253 baseline pathogens showed that of the E. coli strains none was resistant to ofloxacin, three (MIC = 128 mg/l) were resistant to fosfomycin, 3.6% to co-trimoxazole, 6.2% to trimethoprim, 8.8% to ampicillin, and 5.7% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The eradication rates according to the MICs of the corresponding drugs showed equally good eradication rates for fosfomycin up to an MIC of 64 mg/l. Above this level two out of three strains were also eradicated by fosfomycin trometamol. For co-trimoxazole and ofloxacin no intermediately sensitive or resistant strains were found. Within the range of MICs found there were equally good eradication rates for both antibacterial agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Localization of translocating Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis within cecal and colonic tissues of monoassociated mice.
AB  - Normal bacteria can translocate (migrate) across an intact intestinal mucosa, but the anatomical site of bacterial translocation has not been defined. Gastrointestinal (GI) cross-sections were obtained from mice monoassociated with high cecal concentrations of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus faecalis. As previously reported (C. L. Wells, R. P. Jechorek, and K. J. Gillingham, Arch. Surg. 126:247-252, 1991), these mice had viable translocating bacteria recovered from mesenteric lymph nodes and livers. No abnormal GI histology was noted. Immunofluorescence was used to localize GI bacteria, and similar observations were made with each of the three bacterial species. Smaller numbers (P less than 0.01) of bacteria were observed in stomach and small intestinal tissues than in cecal and colonic tissues, suggesting that the preferred site of tissue penetration for intestinal E. coli, P. mirabilis, and E. faecalis might be the cecum or colon as opposed to the stomach or small intestine.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscess formation: abscess-potentiating agents and inhibition of complement-dependent opsonization of abscess-inducing bacteria.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli are synergistic in the production of intraabdominal abscesses. However, these bacteria initiate abscess formation only when inoculated with an agent such as autoclaved colonic contents (ACC) or bran (a fiber analogue). The mechanism of action of the abscess-potentiating agent was studied. Opsonins in normal mouse serum were determined for phagocytic killing by murine neutrophils of B. fragilis and E. coli. Opsonization required fixation of complement by the alternative pathway. ACC (0.2 mg/ml) and bran (1.0 mg/ml) inhibited phagocytic killing of Proteus mirabilis in the presence of normal but not immune serum. Assay of the alternative pathway of complement activation indicated that both bacterial components and abscess-potentiating agents in an abscess-inducing mixture activated complement. These findings suggest that abscess-potentiating agents inhibit opsonization and therefore the subsequent phagocytic killing of bacteria in the nonimmune host.
TI  - Bacterial colonization behaviour: a new virulence strategy in urinary infections?
AB  - The urinary bladder resists bacterial colonization and infection by a number of mechanisms, one of which involves the sloughing of colonized uroepithelial cells. Pathogens which thus become detached from bladder tissue are rapidly eliminated upon voiding of urine. During a recent study of bacterial colonization by the urinary pathogen, Proteus mirabilis, we noted that it colonized glass surfaces such that organisms became widely and evenly dispersed over the surface. In contrast, Pseudomonas fluorescens, a non-pathogen in the urinary tract, did not disperse over the surface but colonized and grew in such a manner as to form small clumps or microcolonies. Other investigators have also shown that Escherichia coli, a common urinary pathogen, initially colonizes bladders in a random, widely-dispersed fashion. We propose that successful bladder pathogens will predominantly adopt colonization behaviour that enables them to widely disperse over bladder tissue and, in so doing, avoid being cleared by the desquamation of uroepithelial cells. Colonization behaviour would therefore represent a previously uncharacterized virulence strategy.
TI  - Microbiological exploitation of cardiac glycosides and alkaloids from Garcinia kola, Borreria ocymoides, Kola nitida and Citrus aurantifolia.
AB  - The four medicinal plants, Garcinia kola (roots), Borreria ocymoides (leaves), Kola nitida (bark) and Citrus aurantifolia (roots) were screened for phytochemical components. They were found to contain tannins, phlobatannins, polyphenols, hydroxymethyl anthraquinones, glucides, saponins, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavanoids and reducing compounds. The aqueous and alcoholic extracts as well as alkaloids and cardiac glycosides of the medicinal plants were tested on various pathogenic bacteria. They were found to inhibit such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The usefulness of the phytochemical bases of these plants as potential sources of pharmaceutical drug preparation is discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of dihydrofolate reductase type VI.
AB  - The complete sequence of the type VI dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene from plasmid pUK672 was determined. The structural gene coded for a polypeptide of 157 amino acids which had a deduced mol. wt of 17,424. Comparison with amino-acid sequences of the type I, type V and Escherichia coli K12 chromosomal DHFRs showed that there was 63%, 61% and 31% homology respectively. Putative RNA polymerase and ribosomal binding sites were identified proximal to the initiation codon and a feature consistent with transcription termination was present distal to the coding region. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme had a subunit mol. wt of 17,500.
TI  - The penicillins.
AB  - The penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. In general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. The initial introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactam [corrected] ring. Subsequently, the aminopenicillins (such as ampicillin and amoxicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella Salmonella, Listeria, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. The search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and temocillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and apalcillin). Finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an aminopenicillin or ticarcillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra. The development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, resistant to beta-lactamase, and without inoculum effect and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.
TI  - [Bacterial translocation in a model of intestinal obstruction. II. Bacteriological study and role of cellular immunity].
AB  - Bacterial translocation (Bt) from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to systemic organs creates the possibility of Infection and sepsis in a great number of pathologic entities. In a mouse model of Intestinal Obstruction (IO), we evaluated the type of micro-organisms and the organs that bacteria frequent translocated. At 24 hours post-10, positive cultures where obtained at the MLN, portal, systemic circulation and peritoneal cavity, establishing that the translocation is bi-directional. The more frequent bacteria isolated were the Streptococcus group D, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., an clostridium. BT occurs at 24 hour post-OI and was due to increased intestinal permeability, at 48 hrs BT increased and related to the physical disruption of the mucosal barrier in the intestinal mucosa. Cell mediated immunity (CMI) response in this model was not altered, although a progressive decrease was observed at 48 hrs it was not significant, suggesting that the CMI play no role in the pathogenesis of BT. In the Control-Laparotomy group, CMI response was increased significantly at 48 hours, suggesting that a simple laparotomy boost the immune defense response.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The immunogenicity of mono- and associated vaccines made from strains of opportunistic bacteria].
AB  - In experiments on white mice the immunogenic potency of two variants of combined  vaccines prepared from strains of opportunistic bacteria was compared with that of monovaccines used as the components of the combined vaccines. All the vaccines under study were found highly immunogenic. Decrease of monovaccine share in the combined vaccine did not reduce the immunogenic potency to any of the strains. An 8- to 16-fold increase in the level of specific antibodies in the colostric lactosera of cows immunized with combined vaccines was observed, and the survival rate of newborn calves increased 3- to 4-fold.
TI  - Novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus Pseudomonas. We found that a new Pseudomonas strain, Pseudomonas flavida IF-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pNI10 and pNI20. They were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pNI10 and 2.9 kb for pNI20. Several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (Kmr or Smr) gene were constructed from pNI10 and pNI20. These plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of Pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid DNA by the usual competent cell method. The vectors derived from pNI10 replicated not only in Pseudomonas but also in some other Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. A total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. In general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the MICs of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Salmonella species and Bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in MIC50, MIC90 and the geometric mean of MIC. For Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs did not change after adding tazobactam. For other species, there was a moderate decrease in MICs. We conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis flagella and MR/P fimbriae: isolation, purification, N-terminal analysis, and serum antibody response following experimental urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection with Proteus mirabilis may lead to serious complications, including cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, fever, bacteremia, and death. In addition to the production of hemolysin and the enzyme urease, fimbriae and flagellum-mediated motility have been postulated as virulence factors for this species. We purified mannose-resistant/proteuslike (MR/P) fimbriae and flagella from strains CFT322 and HU2450, respectively. Electron microscopy revealed highly concentrated preparations of fimbriae and flagella. Fimbrial and flagellar structural subunits were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 18.5 and 41 kDa, respectively. N-terminal sequencing revealed that 10 of the first 20 amino acids of the major MR/P subunit matched the sequence of the P. mirabilis uroepithelial cell adhesin N terminus and 11 of 20 amino acids matched the predicted amino acid sequence of the Escherichia coli P fimbriae structural subunit, PapA. In addition, 90 and 80% homologies were found between the first 20 amino acids of P. mirabilis flagellin and those of Salmonella typhimurium phase-1 flagellin and the E. coli hag gene product, respectively. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified antigens showed a strong reaction between the MR/P fimbriae or flagella and sera of CBA mice challenged transurethrally with P. mirabilis. A possible role for MR/P fimbriae in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection is supported by (i) a strong immune response to the antigen in experimentally infected animals, (ii) amino acid sequence similarity to other enteric surface structure, and (iii) our previously reported observation that MR/P fimbriae are expressed preferentially as the sole fimbrial type in human pyelonephritis isolates.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Smoking, humoral immunity, and ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Since ulcerative colitis predominantly affects non-smokers and ex-smokers we have examined the possibility that smoking modifies the humoral immune response to an antigenic challenge from the gut lumen. Gut lavage was used in healthy subjects and patients with ulcerative colitis, including both smokers and non-smokers. Antibodies in the intestinal fluid to Escherichia coli (five pooled serotypes), Candida albicans, gliadin, ovalbumin, and beta lactoglobulin were measured by ELISA to determine specific antibody concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes. Total IgG, IgA, and IgM were also measured in intestinal secretions and serum. In addition, circulating antibody concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM to three gut commensals - E coli (five pooled serotypes) C albicans, and Poroteus mirabilis were measured. There was a significant reduction in the IgA concentration in intestinal fluid of smokers with ulcerative colitis compared with healthy non-smoking controls. No other significant differences were found between the groups. Overall, these data are not consistent with the idea that smoking suppresses immune responses in the gut and suggest that the effect of smoking in colitis is mediated by another mechanism.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.
TI  - [An electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  - Transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei and Edwardsiella tarda. Different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. For the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses by E. coli indigenous strains M-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. This observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded  by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus, was determined. The structural cat gene encoded a protein of 209 amino acids, which represented one monomer of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Comparisons between the amino acid sequences of the pSCS7-encoded CAT from S. aureus and the previously sequenced CAT variants from S. aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Bacillus pumilis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis were performed. An alignment of CAT amino acid sequences demonstrated the presence of 34 conserved amino acids among all CAT variants. These conserved residues were considered for their possible roles in the structure and function of CAT. On the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. It demonstrated relatively large evolutionary distances between the CAT variants of enteric bacteria, Clostridium, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus species.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - Bacteriology of community acquired urinary tract infection. Analysis of 1048 cases.
AB  - Urine samples from 1048 cases clinically suspected to have urinary tract infection were examined for bacteriological culture and antibiotic sensitivity. Of 1048 cultures, 530 (50.5%) were sterile, 163 (15.5%) showed the presence of nonpathogenic bacteria and 11 (1%) revealed nonsignificant bacteriuria with Escherichia coli. Significant bacteriuria (more than 10(5)/ml) was found in the remaining 344 (32.8%) cases. Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from 170 (16.2%) samples; Klebsiella aerogenes was the next in order, found in 46 (4.3%) cases. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 37 (3.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 29 (2.7%), Proteus mirabilis in 26 (2.4%), Streptococcus faecalis in 21 (2.0%), Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (1%) and Citrobacter freundii in 3 cases. Nalidixic acid was the most effective drug against gram negative organisms. Nitrofurantoin was the next antibiotic of choice, whereas cephalexin was the third drug in order of sensitivity. Ampicillin was the first drug of choice in infection with gram positive cocci, followed by nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, cephalexin and cephaloridine. The results of sensitivity tests emphasise the problem of multiple drug resistance in our community.
TI  - In vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. GR69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 16 mg/l), Morganella morganii (MIC90 128 mg/l) and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to GR69153. GR69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis group.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - Evidence for N----O acetyl migration as the mechanism for O acetylation of peptidoglycan in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - O-acetylated peptidoglycan was purified from Proteus mirabilis grown in the presence of specifically radiolabelled glucosamine derivatives, and the migration of the radiolabel was monitored. Mild-base hydrolysis of the isolated peptidoglycan (to release ester-linked acetate) from cells grown in the presence of 40 microM [acetyl-3H]N-acetyl-D-glucosamine resulted in the release of [3H]acetate, as detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The inclusion of either acetate, pyruvate, or acetyl phosphate, each at 1 mM final concentration, did not result in a diminution of mild-base-released [3H]acetate levels. No such release of [3H]acetate was observed with peptidoglycan isolated from either Escherichia coli incubated with the same radiolabel or P. mirabilis grown with [1,6-3H]N-acetyl-D-glucosamine or D-[1-14C]glucosamine. These observations support a hypothesis that O acetylation occurs by N----O acetyl transfer within the sacculus. A decrease in [3H]acetate release by mild-base hydrolysis was observed with the peptidoglycan of P. mirabilis cultures incubated in the presence of antagonists of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, penicillin G and D-cycloserine. The absence of free-amino sugars in the peptidoglycan of P. mirabilis but the detection of glucosamine in spent culture broths implies that N----O transacetylation is intimately associated with peptidoglycan turnover.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime against bacterial isolates obtained from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin ester, against 792 bacterial isolates representing 36 species was evaluated in comparison to that of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Cefpodoxime inhibited the majority of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. It was also active against Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Overall, cefpodoxime appeared to be less active than ciprofloxacin and TMP/SMX against many pathogens common in cancer patients.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Chlamydia trachomatis were measured by ELISA in the sera of 99 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Increased prevalence of IgA and IgG class antibodies against K. pneumoniae and of IgA class against E. coli was observed in ankylosing spondylitis. No clear correlation between the disease activity and occurrence of antibodies was revealed. The results are in line with the previously published findings suggesting that K. pneumoniae may have a role in the aetiopathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis.
TI  - Cytotoxicity of the HpmA hemolysin and urease of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris against cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a common agent of nosocomially acquired and catheter-associated bacteriuria, can cause acute pyelonephritis. In ascending infections, bacteria colonize the bladder and ascend the ureters to the proximal tubules of the kidney. We postulate that Proteus species uses the HpmA hemolysin and urease to elicit tissue damage that allows entry of these bacteria into the kidney. To study this interaction, strains of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris and their isogenic hemolysin-negative (hpmA) or isogenic urease-negative (ureC) constructs were overlaid onto cultures of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEC) isolated from kidneys obtained by immediate autopsy. Cytotoxicity was measured by release of soluble lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Two strains of P. mirabilis inoculated at 10(6) CFU caused a release of 80% of total LDH after 6 h, whereas pyelonephritogenic hemolytic Escherichia coli CFT073 released only 25% at 6 h (P less than 0.012). Ten P. mirabilis isolates and five P. vulgaris isolates were all hemolytic and cytotoxic and produced urease which was induced by urea. The HpmA hemolysin is apparently responsible for the majority of cytotoxicity in vitro since the hemolysin-negative (hpmA) mutants of P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris were significantly less cytotoxic than wild-type strains. P. mirabilis WPM111 (hemolysin negative) was used to test the effect of urease-catalyzed urea hydrolysis on HRPTEC viability. In the presence of 50 mM urea, WPM111 caused the release of 42% of LDH versus 1% at 6 h in the absence of substrate (P = 0.003). We conclude that the HpmA hemolysin of Proteus species acts as a potent cytotoxin against HRPTEC. In addition, urease apparently contributes to this process when substrate urea is available.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - Activity of some antiseptics against urinary tract pathogens growing as biofilms  on silicone surfaces.
AB  - The activity of chlorhexidine, mandelic acid and a mandelic/lactic mixture were tested against biofilms of four species of gram-negative nosocomial organisms that commonly infect the catheterized urinary tract. Cells growing on silicone discs were exposed to concentrations of agents used in bladder instillation. Citrobacter diversus biofilms proved to be sensitive to all three agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae all survived well in chlorhexidine but their viability was significantly reduced by the mandelic acid formulations. These results suggest that bladder instillations of mandelic acid or mandelic/lactic acids would be more effective than chlorhexidine in eliminating biofilms from catheter surfaces.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria responsible for urinary infections in private practice from 1986 to 1990. Results of 5398 samples].
AB  - For each year from 1986 to 1990, fourteen private laboratories from all over France collected epidemiological data on germs discovered in urinary infections in France. This retrospective and comparative study covers 5,398 dossiers. The sensitivity of germs in private practice in urinary infections (ampicillin, AM-AC, cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, pipemidic acid, pefloxacin, cotrimoxazol) were analysed. Germ resistance tests carried out by the CMI study in the centre of reference (Pr Thabaut, HIA Begin) showed variable divergences according to the different antibiogram techniques employed by the private laboratories.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of oral cefixime therapy in common infectious diseases in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine children, including 20 boys and 9 girls, were enrolled in an open trial of oral cefixime therapy for common pediatric infectious diseases. Patients aged between 0.5 month and 12 years with a mean +/- standard deviation of 2.3 +/- 2.8 years. The diagnoses included 10 of acute otitis media, 2 of purulent rhinitis, 4 of acute enterocolitis, and 13 of urinary tract infection. Most children received 6-12 mg/kg/day of cefixime granules, orally twice daily for more than five days. All 10 cases (100%) of acute otitis media and 2 cases of purulent rhinitis were either cured, or improved by oral cefixime treatment. None of them was microbiologically evaluable. Four cases (100%) of acute enterocolitis, 3 due to Salmonella group B, one due to Shigella flexneri, were also successfully treated with bacteria eradication. However, the cure rate of 13 cases of urinary tract infection was only 85% (11/13). Seven Escherichia coli and 4 Proteus mirabilis infections were eradicated, whereas one each of Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections did not respond to treatment; these two cases had a complicated course. The overall cure and improvement rate was 93%. Although five patients had transient episodes of mild diarrhea, no significant adverse reaction was observed. In summary, oral cefixime given twice daily was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of common infectious diseases in pediatric patients.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amniotic membranes.
AB  - Amniotic membranes are widely used in a multitude of surgical applications and have been shown to reduce bacterial counts and promote healing in infected wounds. Antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid are well documented and the presence of many potentially antibacterial factors has been demonstrated. No such factors have yet been found in amniotic membranes. We have applied a direct disc-diffusion susceptibility test to try to establish the possible existence of such a factor. Amniotic membranes did not inhibit five bacterial species when tested at 3 X 10(6) and 3 X 10(8) colony forming units/ml. However, complete growth inhibition of all organisms was seen immediately under the amniotic membrane discs. These results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of amniotic membranes in vitro is due to their close adherence to the wound surface.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides and Haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  - The accuracy of examination of the Gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively Gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) Enteric bacteria, (b) Pseudomonas, and (c) Bacteroides or Haemophilus, was evaluated. Randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Ps. aeruginosa, B. fragilis, and H. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. A Gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. The direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. The percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. The assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. To test this hypothesis, we prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. Examination of the Gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, H. influenzae, or B. fragilis. Electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of Ps. aeruginosa. The higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing Ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - Further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - It had already been shown with a single virulent strain (A42) of Fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. The present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include Bacillus subtilis, 'Bacteroides melaninogenicus', Clostridium sporogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Proteus mirabilis. The study also showed that five further virulent strains of F. necrophorum closely resembled A42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by Escherichia coli. Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes and S. aureus. One further strain (A6) of F. necrophorum resembled A42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by A. pyogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus and K. oxytoca but differed from it and the other five strains in being only slightly affected by E. coli. This work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of F. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  - The MIC of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. Some of the more resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. The model simulated, in Mueller-Hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. Bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. The first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. On re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. Drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. These occurred at a high frequency in P. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in K. pneumoniae (10(-3)). P. mirabilis (10(-5)), and E. coli (10(-6)). The number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. The results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: MIC ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.
TI  - The recA-recBCD dependent recombination pathways of Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis in Escherichia coli: functions of hybrid enzymes and hybrid pathways.
AB  - The physical maps of cloned recBCD gene regions of Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis were correlated to genes located in this region. The genes thyA, recC, recB, recD and argA were organized as in Escherichia coli. The 3 rec genes code for the 3 different subunits of the RecBCD enzyme and produced enzymes promoting recombination and repair of UV damage in E coli. The recBCD-dependent stimulation of recombination at specific nucleotide sequences called Chi (Chi-activation) was determined in lambda red-gam-crosses. Chi-activation by the different RecBCD enzymes decreased in the order E coli greater than S marcescens greater than P mirabilis. In E coli cloned subunits genes from S marcescens and P mirabilis led to the formation of functional hybrid enzymes consisting of subunits from 2 or even 3 species. The origin of the RecC subunit present in the hybrid enzymes affected the degree of Chi-activation. Further, changes in Chi-activation occurred when the RecD subunit in the enzyme from E coli was replaced by RecD proteins from S marcescens or P mirabilis. This suggested that the RecD subunit determines not only whether or not Chi-activation is possible but also to which extent it occurs. Finally we have reconstituted recombination pathways of S marcescens and P mirabilis by combining the cloned recA and recBCD genes from these species in E coli deleted for recA and recBCD. Both pathways can efficiently promote recombination and repair. Studies are summarized which showed that levels of repair and recombination promoted by the recA-recBCD genes are mostly higher when the recA and recBCD genes came from the same species than from 2 different species (hybrid RecBCD recombination pathway). The data are interpreted to provide evidence that in vivo the RecA protein co-operates with the RecBCD enzyme in recombination and repair of UV damage.
TI  - Shuttle cloning and nucleotide sequences of Helicobacter pylori genes responsible for urease activity.
AB  - Production of a potent urease has been described as a trait common to all Helicobacter pylori so far isolated from humans with gastritis as well as peptic ulceration. The detection of urease activity from genes cloned from H. pylori was made possible by use of a shuttle cosmid vector, allowing replication and movement of cloned DNA sequences in either Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni. With this approach, we cloned a 44-kb portion of H. pylori chromosomal DNA which did not lead to urease activity when introduced into E. coli but permitted, although temporarily, biosynthesis of the urease when transferred by conjugation to C. jejuni. The recombinant cosmid (pILL585) expressing the urease phenotype was mapped and used to subclone an 8.1-kb fragment (pILL590) able to confer the same property to C. jejuni recipient strains. By a series of deletions and subclonings, the urease genes were localized to a 4.2-kb region of DNA and were sequenced by the dideoxy method. Four open reading frames were found, encoding polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 26,500 (ureA), 61,600 (ureB), 49,200 (ureC), and 15,000 (ureD). The predicted UreA and UreB polypeptides correspond to the two structural subunits of the urease enzyme; they exhibit a high degree of homology with the three structural subunits of Proteus mirabilis (56% exact matches) as well as with the unique structural subunit of jack bean urease (55.5% exact matches). Although the UreD-predicted polypeptide has domains relevant to transmembrane proteins, no precise role could be attributed to this polypeptide or to the UreC polypeptide, which both mapped to a DNA sequence shown to be required to confer urease activity to a C. jejuni recipient strain.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam  and piperacillin-tazobactam against strains of Escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis harbouring known beta-lactamases.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli (N = 124) and Proteus mirabilis (N = 29) harboring known beta-lactamases were analyzed as to their susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin alone and in combination with sulbactam, clavulanate, and tazobactam. With TEM 1-producing E. coli, a correlation between specific beta-lactamase activity and the MIC of piperacillin and ampicillin-sulbactam was observed. These strains also showed significant differences in susceptibilities to the various combinations, suggesting that, at least in strains resistant to one combination, several beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations should be tested in the laboratory. All combinations tested enhanced the activity of the beta-lactam towards TEM 1-producing E. coli, piperacillin-tazobactam being the most active. The drugs were less active to OXA 1 enzymes; solely with piperacillin-tazobactam 90% of strains were within the therapeutic range of the drug. Sulbactam acted synergistically to chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate was inactive. Piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited all strains producing chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases at concentrations within the therapeutic range of the drugs. In contrast, TEM 2 of P. mirabilis was not sensitive to ampicillin-sulbactam, but to the other combinations; here again piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  - In the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as Bacteriodes fragilis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. Neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those above contain viable organisms. On incubation in vitro in the presence of serum, these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. To determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. The organisms studied were B. fragilis, E. coli, P. mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The killing in vitro of E. coli and P. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. In contrast, the killing of S. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. However, S. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than P. mirabilis or E. coli, and the killing of S. aureus during in-vitro incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relative contributions of host and microbial factors in bacterial translocation.
AB  - To study the relative contributions of host and microbial factors in bacterial translocation, germfree mice were mono-associated with either Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, or Enterococcus faecalis. Germfree mice included T-cell-deficient nude mice and normal littermates, natural killer cell-deficient beige mice and normal littermates, and triply immunodeficient mice with beige, T-cell, and B-cell mutations and their littermates. Each bacterial species colonized the cecum in similarly high numbers. Bacteria were recovered from the mesenteric lymph node of every mouse in inconsistent numbers, eg, greater numbers of P mirabilis and E coli were recovered from T-cell-deficient nude mice than from their normal littermates, but the opposite was observed with E faecalis. Comparing the three bacterial species resulted in relatively consistent observations, eg, the incidence of E faecalis translocation to the liver was greater than that of E coli or P mirabilis translocation. Thus, the identity of the translocating microbe significantly affected the recovery of viable translocating bacteria.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril) versus multiple-dose norfloxacin: results of a multicenter study in females with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.
AB  - The results of an open, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of Fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril), 3-gram single dose, and Norfloxacin (Noroxine 400), 400 mg twice daily for 5 days, are reported. Clinical and bacteriological assessments were performed before and 3-4 (short-term) and 25-30 days (long-term) after treatment. Only female patients with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection were eligible for inclusion in the study: 33 cases were given Fosfomycin trometamol and 30 cases Norfloxacin. In the overall etiology, Escherichia coli (74% of the strains found), Proteus mirabilis (6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%) are highly predominant. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, the percentages of eradication in the two groups were similar: after the short-term test, 93.9% (31 of 33 patients) in the Fosfomycin trometamol group and 86.6% (26 of 30) in the Norfloxacin group, and after the long-term tests, 73.3% (22 of 30) in the Fosfomycin trometamol group and 77.89% (21 of 27) in the Norfloxacin group. There are no statistically significant differences. The duration of the reported side effects was significantly lower in the Fosfomycin trometamol group. The simplified dosage regimen (single dose) and its favorable benefit/risk ratio justifies the use of Fosfomycin trometamol as a treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in female patients.
TI  - [Beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistant phenotypes in enterobacteria isolated in pediatrics].
AB  - Beta-lactams and aminoglycosides are widely used in the therapy of serious Gram negative infections in pediatrics. In order to survey acquired resistance, the phenotype of resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were characterized for 260 strains of enterobacteriaceae among the mainly isolated species in pediatrics. These phenotypes were established according to the results of the disk susceptibility tests for beta-lactams respectively ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefaloridin and cefotaxim, and aminoglycosides, streptomycin (S), gentamicin (G), tobryamycin (T), amikacin (A), and netilmicin (N). 49% of E. coli and 73% of P. mirabilis strains were resistant to 3 beta-lactams (RRRS). 72% of Salmonella spp. strains were resistant to 4 beta-lactams (RRRR). For the majority of strains, the mainly observed resistance phenotype to aminoglycosides was streptomycin resistance excepted for Salmonella spp., which was S + KGTNA. The high level of acquired resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides among Enterobacteriaceae with the selection of multiresistant strains would be explained by the wild use of cefotaxim and amikacin in pediatrics.
TI  - Rhythmic bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics at a large hospital.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility response of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a set of antibiotics was investigated in a survey comprising 19,380 positive cultures over a period of 5 years in a large hospital environment. Four out of the five species (P. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. The species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. Through this analysis it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. The longest period of oscillation was detected for S. aureus (38 months). K. pneumoniae and E. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and P. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). Species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. Although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo transferrable beta-lactam resistance due to a new plasmid-mediated oxyiminocephalosporinase from a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase (FPM-1) with an isoelectric point of 7.2 and a molecular weight of 26,000 was found in a cefuroxime-resistant clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis strain 6003. FPM-1 can be classified as a type I oxyimino-cephalosporinase on the basis of its substrate specificity and inhibition pattern by clavulanic acid etc., and its conferred resistance on both the strain and transconjugants against most oxyme-type cephalosporins as well as the older ones but not against cefamycins and a few exceptional oxyme-type cephalosporins such as ceftizoxime, ceftazidime and cefixime. In a murine systemic infection model, only these FPM-1-stable drugs exhibited protective activity against the FPM-1-producing P. mirabilis 6003 similar to that against a nonproducing derivative strain. The FPM-1-mediated cefuroxime resistance in P. mirabilis 6003 was transferred to co-infected Escherichia coli 7004 at frequencies between 3.8 x 10(-3) and 4.0 x 10(-2) in a murine ascending urinary tract infection model. In the same infection model due to the FPM-1-producing E. coli transconjugant, FPM-1-stable cefixime was significantly more effective than FPM-1-labile cefteram pivoxil, although both drugs had similar therapeutic effect against its FPM-1-nonproducing counterpart strain.
TI  - Review of clinical experience in the United States with cefpodoxime proxetil in adults with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Two controlled United States trials compared the safety and efficacy of cefpodoxime proxetil (100mg twice daily) with either cefaclor (250mg 3 times daily) or amoxicillin (250mg 3 times daily) in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Treatment duration was 7 days. 307 of 762 patients treated with cefpodoxime proxetil, 99 of 190 treated with cefaclor, and 57 of 185 treated with amoxicillin were evaluable for efficacy. 311, 99 and 59 pathogens were isolated from cefpodoxime proxetil, cefaclor and amoxicillin patients, respectively, the most common pathogens being Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Bacteriological cure rates were 80% (247/307), 82% (81/99) and 70% (40/57) for cefpodoxime proxetil, cefaclor and amoxicillin, respectively. Respective clinical cure rates were 79% (242/307), 79% (78/99) and 72% (41/57). Cefpodoxime proxetil was well tolerated, and there was no significant difference between the groups in the overall incidence of adverse experiences. Thus, cefpodoxime proxetil is efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections and compares favourably with cefaclor and amoxicillin.
TI  - Interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of Enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. Seleniated tRNA species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. Two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond to the 80 kDa and 110 kDa subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of E. coli. In those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. The similarity of the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. Antibodies raised against the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide from E. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kDa polypeptide in those organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. These organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhF gene from E. coli. In an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhF gene homologue from Enterobacter aerogenes. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame TGA (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the E. coli gene. This fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, E. coli. Moreover, the E. coli fdhF gene was expressed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.
TI  - Ability of uropathogens to bind to Tamm Horsfall protein-coated renal tubular cells.
AB  - Epithelial cells were isolated from a healthy human kidney and found to be of normal, renal tubular origin. The cells were maintained in tissue culture and found to secrete Tamm Horsfall protein (THP). Three strains of uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and one each of Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to adhere to the THP-coated tubular cells. Extraneous THP bound to all the organisms except P fimbriated E. coli, and caused a reduction in the adhesion of type 1 fimbriated E. coli and P. mirabilis to the renal cells. However, irrespective of reduced adhesion in three of five strains tested, there was adequate evidence to indicate that THP does not competitively exclude all uropathogenic adhesion. On the contrary, its presence on renal cells may act to mediate bacterial colonization.
TI  - Vaginal hysterectomy: cefuroxime, metronidazole or both?
AB  - A randomized double-blind prospective study on the efficacy of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis compared cefuroxime versus metronidazole versus the combination of both agents in vaginal hysterectomy. Overall antibiotic prophylaxis was effective in abscess prevention (one abscess in 68 patients). In the metronidazole group a significantly higher grade of morbidity was observed: febrile morbidity 41% versus 4% in the two other groups; bacteriuria 73% versus 17% in the cefuroxime group, versus 13% in the combined group; urinary tract infection 23%, versus 0% in the two other groups; post-operative prescription of antibiotics 41%, versus 0% in the two other groups. Febrile morbidity and bacteriuria correlated positively with Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. These micro-organisms were recovered significantly more often from the vagina of patients in the metronidazole group. Cefuroxime was successful, metronidazole failed in the prevention of minor morbidity. We could not observe any effect from the addition of metronidazole to the cefuroxime prophylaxis.
TI  - Changes in the antibiotic sensitivities of urinary pathogens, 1971-1989.
AB  - All urinary pathogens from general practice and hospital have been tested for sensitivity to a range of antimicrobial agents for the last 19 years. There have been marked changes during that time. In general practice there has been a considerable increase in the proportion of staphylococcal infections from 5.1% to a peak of 14.8% in 1982 and a more recent decline to 3.4%. There has also been a decrease in the proportion caused by Proteus mirabilis, from 9.2% to 5.0%. Similar, but smaller changes have been observed in the proportions of hospital urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by these organisms, while the proportion of hospital infections due to Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. has fallen from 16.8% to 9.2%. These and other changes have been reflected in changing patterns of sensitivity to antibiotics. In particular, sensitivity of urinary pathogens to ampicillin/amoxycillin has continued to fall both in general practice and in hospital. Nalidixic acid resistance is becoming more important as the proportion of Gram-positive urinary pathogens (especially enterococci) increases. More organisms were sensitive to ciprofloxacin than the other drugs tested, with no evidence of increasing resistance over a six-year period. Over the same time there has been a reduction of overall sensitivity of urinary pathogens to trimethoprim from 90.8% to 82.5% in general practice, with no significant change in isolates from hospital practice.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - Genetic analysis of Escherichia coli urease genes: evidence for two distinct loci.
AB  - Studies with two uropathogenic urease-producing Escherichia coli strains, 1021 and 1440, indicated that the urease genes of each are distinct. Recombinant plasmids encoding urease activity from E. coli 1021 and 1440 differed in their restriction endonuclease cleavage sites and showed minimal DNA hybridization under stringent conditions. The polypeptides encoded by the DNA fragments containing the 1021 and 1440 urease loci differed in electrophoretic mobility under reducing conditions. Regulation of urease gene expression differed in the two ureolytic E. coli. The E. coli 1021 locus is probably chromosomally encoded and has DNA homology to Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia species and to about one-half of the urease-producing E. coli tested. The E. coli 1440 locus is plasmid encoded; plasmids with DNA homology to the 1440 locus probe were found in urease-producing Salmonella spp., Providencia stuartii, and two E. coli isolates. In addition, the 1440 urease probe was homologous to Proteus mirabilis DNA.
TI  - Trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, bacterial adhesion and polymorphonuclear leucocyte function.
AB  - Culturing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations (1/4 MIC) of trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole or their combination, resulted in reduced adherence of all the above strains. The number of phagocytosed bacteria pre-exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of the above antibiotics was not significantly changed, but a significant increase of bactericidal activity of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes was observed. Furthermore, filtrates of K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis grown in the presence of trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulphamethoxazole induced an increased chemotactic response of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
TI  - [Studies on the sub-MIC of beta-lactam antibiotics--bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum].
AB  - Bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum i.e. patients with cancer, the  elderly, diabetes, was stronger than that in normal serum against Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) but was weaker against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Against Escherichia coli (E. coli), bactericidal activity on serum of patients with cancer was weaker in the following order, that in elderly serum, that in diabetic serum. Against Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), bactericidal activity in elderly serum was similar to that in normal serum but was stronger than that in serum of patients with cancer. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), bactericidal activity in elderly serum and diabetic serum was similar to that in normal serum but was weaker than that in serum of patients with cancer. Piperacillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, normal serum and compromised host's serum at a concentration of 1/4 MIC against E. coli, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa. Aspoxicillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, and bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity in normal serum and serum of patients with cancer against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. While cefazolin and cefmetazole slightly inhibited the growth of bacteria in nutrient broth, they showed hardly any bactericidal activity in normal serum and compromised host's serum.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Severe infections treated with intravenous ofloxacin: a prospective clinical multicentre Swiss study.
AB  - In this open prospective clinical trial of iv ofloxacin, 87 patients were treated for severe bacterial infections. Overall results showed a clinical cure rate of 75% and 79/87 87 patients improved. 86% of causative organisms (all sensitive to ofloxacin) were eliminated. The best results were obtained in urinary tract infections where all 30 patients were clinically cured and 27 organisms (Escherichia coli, group D streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were eliminated. Rapid clinical cure was observed in five patients with prostatitis. Good results were seen in arthritis and osteomyelitis. Less than three days of parenteral therapy were required before improvement was seen in patients presenting with severe enterocolitis. Ofloxacin treatment was used for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 35 patients. Clinical improvement was noted in 28 patients. Five patients had unsatisfactory responses, mainly due to underlying diseases. There were two failures, both in pneumococcal pneumonia. Three minor side effects were recorded. Ofloxacin can be given for severe bacterial infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, other Gram-negative rods and other sensitive organisms. It can be given in penicillin allergic patients but it should not be used in pneumococcal pneumonia.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis: observations on its etiology, mortality and sequelae].
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out on all cases diagnosed with neonatal meningitis at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez. A rate of 9.6 cases per 1,000 discharged patients was found as well as 6.7% association with sepsis. In 50 of the cases analyzed, an etiologic agent was identified in 23 children; the main bacteria identified were Escherichia coli (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterobacter (4%), Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas sp (2%), respectively. The mortality rate was 60% and sequelae were seen in 13 of the surviving 20 patients. The unfavorable prognosis of neonates with meningitis forces us to establish an early diagnosis, make every effort to identify the causing agent and try new medications as well as co-adjuvant treatments.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Interactions of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis with mouse mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - Five strains of enterobacteria (three of Escherichia coli and two of Proteus mirabilis) were studied to assess and compare their phagocytic uptake and intracellular killing by mouse macrophages. Each strain was injected intraperitoneally into separate groups of mice and peritoneal exudate cells were harvested after 3 min for phagocytosis to occur in vivo. Acridine orange staining showed that there were approximately 10-fold fewer intracellular P. mirabilis than E. coli cells. The average numbers of viable intracellular bacteria per leucocyte were 0.03 and 0.02 for P. mirabilis strains M13 and H1, respectively, and 0.48, 0.45, and 0.28 for E. coli strains M14, A-D M5 and H40. Thus, both P. mirabilis strains were ingested less readily than any of the three E. coli strains (p less than 0.01). The rates of in-vitro intracellular killing were similar for all five strains of bacteria. The intracellular killing constants (Kk) for the three mouse isolates were 0.017, 0.016 and 0.020 min for E. coli M14 and A-D M5, and P. mirabilis M13, respectively; the Kks for the two human isolates were 0.026 and 0.029/min for E. coli H40 and P. mirabilis H1, respectively. The Kks for all five strains were not significantly different. Assuming that the numbers of viable intracellular bacteria at the beginning of the assay represented 100% viability, 6-17% of the intracellular bacteria remained viable after 2 h, reflecting log10 3.9-5.6 bacteria (6-8) x 10(6) peritoneal exudate cells. Intravenous injection of these five strains into separate groups of mice demonstrated that the P. mirabilis strains were more virulent than the E. coli strains. Injection of each P. mirabilis strain was associated with ruffled fur and death, whereas mice given any of the three E. coli strains remained visibly healthy and none died. Consistent with these observations, quantitation of viable bacteria in the liver and spleen showed that greater numbers of P. mirabilis M13 than of E. coli M14 or A-D M5 persisted in these organs; similarly greater numbers of P. mirabilis H1 than of E. coli H40 persisted in the liver and spleen. Because the rates of intracellular killing of these five strains were similar, the relative virulence of both strains of P. mirabilis appeared to be associated with decreased phagocytic uptake rather than differences in intracellular survival.
TI  - [Cooperation between the urologist and microbiologist in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. II. The most common microbial species and their sensitivity to antimicrobial drugs in sepsis at the Urologic Clinic of the Medical School Hospital].
AB  - The authors investigated the spectrum of aetiological agents and their sensitivity to antimicrobial substances in 52 patients with septicaemia at the Urological Clinic in Hradec Kralove during 1984-1987. They found a predominating number of Gram-negative bacteria (82%). The most frequent agent producing sepsis was Klebsiella pneumoniae (19X), its source were in 52% the urinary pathways and 16% the cannula in the subclavian vein. In nine instances the aetiological agent was Escherichia coli and 5 times Proteus mirabilis. The above microorganisms are the most important pathogenic organisms of the urinary pathways. In all cases of bacteriaemia urosepsis was involved. The source of sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7X) was in 43% the urinary tract, in particular in conjunction with instrumental procedures and in 14% a cannula in the subclavian vein. The most effective antimicrobial substance in Gram-negative bacteraemia in the investigated group was amicacin (100%); high sensitivity was recorded also in colistin. In Gram-positive bacteriaemia, where most frequently enterococci were isolated (6X), ampicillin and vancomycin were most effective.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of cefodizime in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of cefodizime in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis were evaluated in an open, international, multicentre study. In total, 128 patients were treated with 1 g cefodizime bd iv or im for a mean of 8.3 days. Underlying urinary tract abnormalities were present in 35% of cases. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (79/97 evaluable cases) and Proteus mirabilis (8/97 evaluable cases). The overall clinical and bacteriological success rate was 89.7% (87/97). The drug was well tolerated, with only a few mild and transitory adverse events. Tolerance at the site of injection was good in 97.5% (78/80) of those treated iv, and 79% (38/48) of those treated im. Three patients had skin reactions which were probably related to cefodizime. Alterations of laboratory parameters were seen transiently in five patients (3.9%). Cefodizime is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis.
TI  - The effect of protein and urine on uropathogen adhesion to polymer substrata.
AB  - Uropathogenic adhesion was measured using a range of polymer materials with differing surface tension properties. Experiments were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (controls), Tamm Horsfall protein (THP), and human urine with quantitation by image analysis. The results showed that THP did not bind to the polymer materials and therefore did not act as a receptor surface for type 1 fimbriated Escherichia coli. However, the THP did interfere with adhesion by binding directly to these organisms as well as to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and, to a lesser extent, Proteus mirabilis. Incubation of the uropathogens in THP and urine resulted in altered adhesion profiles to polymer surfaces, with no single trend apparent. The results emphasize that fluid components, particularly proteins, and substratum surface tension influence bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.
TI  - Homology among bacterial catalase genes.
AB  - Catalase activities in crude extracts of exponential and stationary phase cultures of various bacteria were visualized following gel electrophoresis for comparison with the enzymes from Escherichia coli. Citrobacter freundii, Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium exhibited patterns of catalase activity similar to E. coli, including bifunctional HPI-like bands and a monofunctional HPII-like band. Proteus mirabilis, Erwinia carotovora, and Serratia marcescens contained a single band of monofunctional catalase with a mobility intermediate between the HPI-like and HPII-like bands. The cloned genes for catalases HPI (katG) and HPII (katE) from E. coli were used as probes in Southern hybridization analyses for homologous sequences in genomic DNA of the same bacteria. katG was found to hybridize with fragments from C. freudii, Ent. aerogenes, Sal. typhimurium, and K. pneumoniae but not at all with Ed. tarda, P. mirabilis, S. marcesens, or Er. carotovora. katE hybridized with C. freundii and K. pneumoniae DNAs and not with the other bacterial DNAs.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (GM), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (AGs) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical isolates obtained during a period of July-December 1989. 1. GM-resistant strains were noted in 24% of Staphylococcus aureus, 12% of Enterobacter spp., 24% of Serratia marcescens, 7% of Morganella morganii and 26% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no GM-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. 2. A majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and a large number of GM-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. GM showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of S. marcescens, M. morganii and P. aeruginosa. 3. Among all the isolates tested of S. marcescens, 24% were GM-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (TOB)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (DKB)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (AMK)-resistant, hence the incidence of GM-resistant strains was the lowest. This tendency was also observed with P. vulgaris. However, among P. aeruginosa, 26% were GM-resistant, 14% TOB-resistant, 18% DKB-resistant and 22% AMK-resistant, thus the incidence rate for GM-resistance was somewhat higher. These results suggest that different AGs-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. Comparing the ratio of GM-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio increased among S. aureus, while decreases were observed among Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in GM-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Bacteroides fragilis recA gene.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.5-kb DNA segment containing the Bacteroides fragilis recA gene was determined. The coding region of the recA gene specifies a protein of 318 amino acids. The RecA protein of B. fragilis shows significant homology with that of Escherichia coli, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. No SOS box characteristic of LexA-regulated promoters could be identified in the 5'-noncoding region of the B. fragilis recA gene. Promoter activity of the cloned recA gene in E. coli was located within a 113-bp fragment of the B. fragilis DNA by in vitro construction of operon fusions with a promoterless lacZ gene. The transcription start point for this gene in B. fragilis was determined by primer extension analysis.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of uropathogenic bacteria to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefmetazole and gentamicin. Nine-year survey of changing patterns of susceptibilities].
AB  - We analyzed antibiotic susceptibilities of urinary isolates of Escherichia coli,  Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Indole (+) Proteus group to ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole (CMZ) and gentamicin (GM) in 69 laboratories in 1988 and also studied changing patterns of susceptibilities from 1980 to 1988. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution method (MUELLER-HINTON agar, BBL) with inoculation of 10(6) cfu/ml of bacteria. Ninety to 99% of the strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis were inhibited at a concentration of 6.25 micrograms/ml of CEZ and CMZ and of 1.56 micrograms/ml of GM. Approximately 80% of the strains of Indole (+) Proteus group were inhibited at concentrations of 6.25 micrograms/ml of CMZ and of 1.56 micrograms/ml of GM. However, resistance to ABPC and CEZ was high, with 83% and 81% of the strains being not inhibited at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml of ABPC and CEZ, respectively. No significant changes in susceptibilities of the 4 bacteria to the above 4 antibiotics were observed over the 9 year period. No increase was found in the incidence of the resistant strains of the 4 bacteria to CMZ and GM, nor of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to CEZ.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a Proteus mirabilis DNA fragment homologous to the 60K-rnpA-rpmH-dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB region of Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 6.5-kb DNA fragment from Proteus mirabilis hybridized to the Escherichia coli dnaA gene. This DNA fragment was cloned and the nucleotide (nt) sequence determined. The fragment is homologous to a region of the E. coli chromosome containing a part of the gene encoding a 60-kDa membrane-associated protein (60K), the rnpA-rpmH-dnaA-dnaN-recF genes, and the N-terminal part of the gyrB gene. The degree of homology is variable: the amino-acid (aa) sequence of a part of the 60K protein and a part of the DnaA protein is only minimally conserved, whereas the C-terminal 148 aa of DnaA are identical in the two species. The conservation of the nt sequence between the rnpA gene and the gene encoding the 60K protein suggests that this region encodes a hitherto unrecognized protein. The ORF for this protein partially overlaps the 3' end of the rnpA structural gene, and the degree of conservation suggests that this gene is important for these bacteria.
TI  - Cloning, partial sequence, expression, and antigenic analysis of the filamentous  hemagglutinin gene of Bordetella pertussis.
AB  - The gene coding for the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), one of the main factors  involved in mediating adherence of Bordetella pertussis to ciliated host cells, was cloned in Escherichia coli, and the 3,500-base-pair nucleotide sequence encoding the amino-terminal region was determined. Molecular cloning, together with the characterization of recombinant FHA-related proteins produced in E. coli, revealed that the primary translation product is a protein of about 370 kilodaltons (kDa). The mature 220-kDa FHA polypeptide secreted by B. pertussis is most probably generated by proteolytic processing that eliminates a carboxy-terminal portion of about 150 kDa. The 1,087 amino-terminal residues of the predicted FHA sequence showed a number of remarkable features. Extensive homology to the Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis hemolysin proteins was found between amino acids 91 and 205 of the FHA sequence, suggesting involvement of this FHA domain in host cell binding or secretion of FHA from B. pertussis. In addition, two regions containing repetitive amino acid sequences were identified. One region, extending from residues 382 to 664, was formed by six repeats, and a second, extending from residues 701 to 912, contained three repeats. The reactivities of several recombinant FHA-derived proteins with a panel of monoclonal antibodies identified at least four epitopes composing an immunoreactive domain present in the carboxy-terminal moiety of the mature FHA.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins).
AB  - A novel direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins) was achieved by treatment of 7 beta (6 beta)-[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1- ylidene)methylimino]cephem (penam) esters with N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)formamide, followed by deblocking with Girard reagent T to give the corresponding 7 alpha (6 alpha)-formamido-7 beta (6 beta)-amino derivatives. Three 7 alpha-formamidocephalosporins were prepared by the conventional N-acylation of 7 alpha-formamidocephem. All of them were resistant to beta-lactamases, showing similar MIC values against both of a pair of a beta-lactamase-producing strain and the corresponding non or low-producing strain of the same species of bacteria, when tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii.
TI  - [Proteus peritonitis-bacteremia in mice--a model for studying postvaccinal Proteus immunity].
AB  - The dynamics of the formation of postvaccinal immunity after immunization with preparations obtained with the use of hydroxylamine (HA) preparations from Proteus strains of different O serogroups, Salmonella minnesota Re-mutant and the common antimicrobial antigen isolated from Escherichia coli 14 has been studied on mice with Proteus peritonitis-bacteremia used as a model. The study has revealed that intraperitoneal immunization with Proteus HA preparations stimulates the phagocytic activity of peritoneal mononuclear cells in mice and induces an increase in the titers of specific O antibodies. Proteus antigens ensure the formation of anti-Proteus immunity, preventing the death of the animals from peritonitis-bacteremia. The protection of mice from such infection resulting from the injection of the common antigens of gram-negative bacteria is considerably less. These data are indicative of the possibility of using Proteus peritonitis-bacteremia as a model for the study of the protective potency of Proteus vaccines.
TI  - The diagnosis of bacteriuria during pregnancy.
AB  - Three diagnostic tests, Nitur, Urobact, and Uricult, were evaluated in the detection of bacteriuria in 865 pregnant women. As reference method agar culture was performed. Heavy growth (greater than 10(5) CFU/ml) of urinary tract bacteria was considered a true positive result and demonstrated in 58 (6.7%) of the women, 14 of whom had gram-negative rods. The sensitivity of the nitrite test was extremely low (0.13). The test gave negative results in eight of 17 specimens yielding heavy growth of Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis. Although the Urobact test was highly sensitive as regards gram-negative infection, it had an unacceptably low (0.27) predictive value in positive tests. The sensitivity of the Uricult test was low (0.35) in this study. The predictive value (0.50) of a positive test result may be acceptable, since just over half of the false positive results were explainable by moderate growth of urinary tract pathogens (10(4)-10(5) CFU/ml). It is argued that semi-quantitative urine culture may be preferable to the rapid diagnostic methods studied for the screening of bacteriuria in pregnant women.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil in a pharmacokinetic in-vitro model.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. Strains of Klebsiella spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. While for Esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--Staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. The lower doses showed stepwise lower activities. Apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like SHV 2 or TEM 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in Esch. coli and H. influenzae did not affect the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. The results show that cefpodoxime was more active against Gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.
TI  - Morganella morganii urease: purification, characterization, and isolation of gene sequences.
AB  - Morganella morganii, a very common cause of catheter-associated bacteriuria, was  previously classified with the genus Proteus on the basis of urease production. M. morganii constitutively synthesizes a urease distinct from that of other uropathogens. The enzyme, purified 175-fold by passage through DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Mono-Q, and Superose 6 chromatography resins, was found to have a native molecular size of 590 kilodaltons and was composed of three distinct subunits with apparent molecular sizes of 63, 15, and 6 kilodaltons, respectively. Amino-terminal analysis of the subunit polypeptides revealed a high degree of conservation of amino acid sequence between jack bean and Proteus mirabilis ureases. Km for urea equalled 0.8 mM. Antiserum prepared against purified enzyme inhibited activity by 43% at a 1:2 dilution after 1 h of incubation. All urease activity was immunoprecipitated from cytosol by a 1:16 dilution. Antiserum did not precipitate ureases of other species except for one Providencia rettgeri strain but did recognize the large subunits of ureases of Providencia and Proteus species on Western blots (immunoblots). Thirteen urease-positive cosmid clones of Morganella chromosomal DNA shared a 3.5-kilobase (kb) BamHI fragment. Urease gene sequences were localized to a 7.1-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment. Tn5 mutagenesis revealed that between 3.3 and 6.6 kb of DNA were necessary for enzyme activity. A Morganella urease DNA probe did not hybridize with gene sequences of other species tested. Morganella urease antiserum recognized identical subunit polypeptides on Western blots of cytosol from the wild-type strain and Escherichia coli bearing the recombinant clone which corresponded to those seen in denatured urease. Although the wild-type strain and recombinant clone produced equal amounts of urease protein, the clone produced less than 1% of the enzyme activity of the wild-type strain.
TI  - Cytotoxic activity of the Proteus hemolysin HpmA.
AB  - We previously showed that hpmA is the hemolysin determinant most commonly found among Proteus isolates. To assess the potential contribution of HpmA to virulence, we first characterized the toxic activities of this hemolysin. Hemolytic activity was present in total cell cultures and cell-free supernatants of Proteus clinical isolates as well as Escherichia coli containing cloned hpm genes. HpmA also possesses cytotoxic activity which was detected by a chromium release assay against a variety of target cell lines (Daudi, Raji, T24, U937, and Vero). Analysis of the dose response of bacterial cells against both T24 cells and erythrocytes showed that E. coli containing cloned hpm genes was 30-fold more cytotoxic than Proteus mirabilis BA6163. Also, 10(5)-fold more bacterial cells were needed to lyse T24 cells than to lyse erythrocytes. HpmA- mutants of two Proteus strains in which the central portion of hpmA was deleted were constructed. These HpmA- mutants, which have lost the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities exhibited by their respective parent strains, demonstrate that HpmA is needed for both of these activities. In an ascending model of murine urinary tract infection, the hpmA mutant strain WPM111 behaved no differently from its parent strain, BA6163, with respect to either the level of kidney colonization or histopathological changes in the kidney. However, WPM111 had a sixfold higher 50% lethal dose than BA6163 when injected intravenously into C3H mice.
TI  - The HpmA hemolysin is more common than HlyA among Proteus isolates.
AB  - Two different hemolysins, HpmA and HlyA, have been reported in Proteus spp. To study the distribution of these hemolysins among Proteus strains, isolates from various infections and normal feces were screened for hemolysin production. All 63 Proteus mirabilis strains and 23 of the 24 Proteus vulgaris strains produced a calcium-independent hemolytic activity detectable in cell-free supernatants. The calcium-independent activity was due to HpmA; this activity correlated with the presence of hpmA sequences and the production of an extracellular 166-kilodalton (kDa) protein that reacted with anti-HpmA antiserum. HpmA- mutants, constructed by deletion of the central portion of the hpmA gene, did not produce the 166-kDa protein and were no longer hemolytic when compared with their respective parent strains. Among the 87 P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris isolates examined, calcium-dependent hemolytic activity was produced by only two P. vulgaris strains. These strains produced a 110-kDa protein which comigrated with the Escherichia coli hemolysin (HlyA) antibodies in immunoblots. These studies show that Proteus spp. produce two distinct extracellular hemolysins, with nearly all strains producing the calcium-independent hemolysin, HpmA, but only an occasional P. vulgaris isolate producing HlyA.
TI  - Mucinophilic and chemotactic properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to  pulmonary colonization in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Representative isolates of nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied to investigate the hypothesis that mucinophilic and chemotactic properties in this species act as potential factors in the initial stages of pulmonary colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Transmission electron microscopy with a surfactant monolayer technique was used in a novel manner to demonstrate the adhesion of all 10 P. aeruginosa strains examined to porcine gastric mucin and tracheobronchial mucin from a patient with CF. Control experiments showed that Escherichia coli K-12 and single representatives of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella aerogenes did not bind to these mucins. The Adler capillary technique, used to measure bacterial chemotactic response, showed that purified CF mucin acted as a chemoattractant for most P. aeruginosa strains, with the exception of the nonmotile mutant M2Fla- and the nonchemotactic mutant WR-5. The ability of the major sugar and amino acid components of mucin to act as chemoattractants was investigated. The degree of chemotaxis was strain specific; optimum chemotaxis was observed toward serine, alanine, glycine, proline, and threonine. No strain showed chemotaxis to N-acetylneuraminic acid, but all strains showed a strain-dependent chemotactic response to the sugars L-fucose, D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. These results provide new information on the mucinophilic and chemotactic properties of nonmucoid P. aeruginosa and support the hypothesis that these properties could play a role in the initial stages of pulmonary colonization in patients with CF.

AB  
TI  - [The in vitro effect of a combination of sulbactam with cephalothin and cefazolin on strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis which produce beta lactamase].
AB  - The effect of the combination of sulbactam, cephalothin, and cephazolin was studied in vitro on 88 strains of E. coli and 11 strains of P. mirabilis producing beta-lactamases. Quantitative susceptibility of the tested strains to cephalothin was examined by the disk dilution method and the effect of the combinations with sulbactam by the micromethod. The production of beta-lactamases was determined by the qualitative test with the chromogenic substrate PODAC. Of the total number of 160 E. coli strains beta-lactamases were established in 53.3% of the strains. Of the 47 P. mirabilis strains 23.4% were found to produce beta-lactamases. The effect of the combinations with sulbactam was assessed as synergistic, additive, indifferent or antagonistic. In the combination of sulbactam in the concentration of 16.0 mg/l with cephalothin and cephazolin a higher rate of synergistic and additive effect was recorded on both strains. In none of the combinations did sulbactam exert an antagonistic effect.
TI  - Molecular characterization of cytotoxins produced by Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella.
AB  - The leukotoxin of Pasteurella haemolytica has been implicated as one of the major virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. To gain a better understanding of the various biochemical, antigenic and toxigenic properties of the toxin, the genetic determinant (lkt) which encodes the leukotoxin has been cloned from P haemolytica serotype 1. Results from the molecular characterization of this determinant showed that four genes are required to synthesize and secrete the active toxin from P. haemolytica. This information provides the basis for genetic manipulation of the determinant to produce different "forms" of the leukotoxin for various studies. In addition, lkt was found to be homologous to the alpha-hemolysin determinant (hly) of Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis and Morganella morganii. Further evidence is being accumulated demonstrating the presence of the lkt/hly determinant in several species of Actinobacillus and Haemophilus. This suggests the wide dissemination of the lkt/hly determinant in many pathogenic bacteria and established the family of Rtx cytotoxins.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus clindamycin in the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis.
AB  - Sixty-eight patients with postpartum endomyometritis were enrolled in this open randomized comparative study. Forty-two patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 26 received clindamycin. The cure rates were similar in the two groups: 83% in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and 88% in the clindamycin group. The most frequent endometrial bacterial isolates were Bacteroides bivius, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Bacteremia was present in 15 of 68 (22%), the most frequent isolates being Mycoplasma (four cases) and B bivius (three cases). Clindamycin-resistant species were S faecalis, E coli, and Proteus mirabilis. There were seven treatment failures in the ampicillin/sulbactam group; only one isolate (an E coli) was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam. In a significant number of these failures, Mycoplasma was isolated. Ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin were found to be equally efficacious in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Nucleotide sequencing of the Proteus mirabilis calcium-independent hemolysin genes (hpmA and hpmB) reveals sequence similarity with the Serratia marcescens hemolysin genes (shlA and shlB).
AB  - We cloned a 13.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the calcium-independent hemolysin determinant (pWPM110) from a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis (477-12). The DNA sequence of a 7,191-base-pair region of pWPM110 was determined. Two polypeptides are encoded in this region, HpmB and HpmA (in that transcriptional order), with predicted molecular masses of 63,204 and 165,868 daltons, respectively. A putative Fur-binding site was identified upstream of hpmB overlapping the -35 region of the proposed hpm promoter. In vitro transcription-translation of pWPM110 DNA and other subclones confirmed the assignment of molecular masses for the predicted polypeptides. These polypeptides are predicted to have NH2-terminal leader peptides of 17 and 29 amino acids, respectively. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified extracellular hemolysin (HpmA) confirmed the cleavage of the 29-amino-acid leader peptide in the secreted form of HpmA. Hemolysis assays and immunoblot analysis of Escherichia coli containing subclones expressing hpmA, hpmB, or both indicated that HpmB is necessary for the extracellular secretion and activation of HpmA. Significant nucleotide identity (52.1%) was seen between hpm and the shl hemolysin gene sequences of Serratia marcescens despite differences in the G+C contents of these genes (hpm, 38%; shl, 65%). The predicted amino acid sequences of HpmB and HpmA are also similar to those of ShlB and ShlA, the respective sequence identities being 55.4 and 46.7%. Predicted cysteine residues and major hydrophobic and amphipathic domains have been strongly conserved in both proteins. Thus, we have identified a new hemolysin gene family among gram-negative opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial phospholipid analysis by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  - The structural analysis of naturally occurring bacterial phospholipids in mixtures by fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry are reported. The bacterial strains examined included several genera of actinomycetes, two strains of Escherichia coli, and one strain each of Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FAB mass spectrometry proved to be a useful tool for the structural identification of phospholipids in mixtures and provided stable pseudo-molecular ions and characteristic fragment ions which permitted the identification of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyl choline. Information regarding the chain length of the fatty acids, their degree of unsaturation in the chains and the presence of hydroxyl groups was also obtained. The results obtained by FAB mass spectrometry were supported by high-resolution mass spectral data, tandem mass spectrometric studies and FAB mass spectrometry of components which had been separated and partially purified by thin-layer chromatography. Each organism displayed a highly characteristic phospholipid profile suggesting the possible use of FAB mass spectrometry as a method for rapid bacterial detection and identification.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of the main opportunistic pathogenic aerobic bacteria].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 1421 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. was studied. Gentamicin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and ristomycin proved to be the antibiotics of choice in treatment of purulent inflammatory diseases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus. For antibiotic therapy of infections caused by gram-negative organisms gentamicin and polymixin might be recommended.
TI  - HlyB-dependent secretion of hemolysin by uropathogenic Escherichia coli requires  conserved sequences flanking the chromosomal hly determinant.
AB  - The synthesis and secretion of hemolysin (HlyA) by Escherichia coli are governed  by four contiguous genes (hlyCABD) that are closely conserved on plasmids and, among human pathogenic strains, on the chromosome. We have previously shown that in plasmid pHly152 the coexpressed synthesis and export functions are uncoupled by intraoperon transcription termination, which is in turn alleviated by antitermination dictated in cis by a region upstream of the hly operon. In this study we describe an analogous region of ca. 1,100 base pairs flanking the chromosomal hly determinant of the uropathogenic strain E. coli 2001. This region had no significant effect on intracellular levels of hemolysin but activated strongly, both in cis and in trans, the specific hlyB-hlyD-dependent hemolysin secretion function. The secretion-activating region increased the transcription of the secretion gene hlyB, but the transcription effect was not as pronounced as that seen in the pHly152 determinant and was not evident when the region was present in trans to the hemolysin genes, suggesting that, in addition to transcriptional activation, the region may possibly exert a secondary posttranscriptional influence. Southern hybridizations with the 1,100-base pairs secretion-activating sequence showed low identity to plasmid pHly152 and no identity with total DNA from nonhemolytic uropathogenic E. coli or hemolytic isolates of Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In contrast, hybridization to total DNA from hemolytic E. coli isolates belonging to different serotypes showed strong conservation of the activating sequence, indicating that it is an integral component of the chromosomal hly determinant that is widespread among uropathogenic E. coli.
TI  - [Hospital and district differences in susceptibilities to antibiotics of main clinical isolates].
AB  - A nationwide survey of susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Proteus mirabilis initiated in 1980 was continued in 1986. This report documents differences in susceptibilities of clinical isolates of the above microorganisms to ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole (CMZ) and gentamicin (GM) among general hospitals throughout Japan. Clinical isolates of each species of microorganisms which were collected in 24 hospitals made up each study group and were collected at the Kosei General Hospital, Tokyo, from April 1980 to March 1986. We compared the variability in the resistant rates (MIC greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml) and MICs of each antibiotic for 50% and 80% of the isolates among the hospitals. MICs were determined by the serial 2 fold agar plate dilution method, standardized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy, with an inoculum of approximately 10(6) CFU/ml or 10(8) CFU/ml. Susceptibility patterns of S. aureus to ABPC, CEZ and GM, of E. coli to ABPC, of Klebsiella sp. to CEZ and GM and of P. mirabilis to ABPC, CEZ and GM varied from hospital to hospital. On the other hand, the differences in the susceptibility patterns among the 6 districts of Japan were not obvious, because the differences were affected by different susceptibility patterns of each hospital located in each district.
TI  - 6-(substituted methylene)penems, potent broad spectrum inhibitors of bacterial beta-lactamase. II. Racemic furyl and thienyl derivatives.
AB  - A series of racemic 6-(substituted methylene)penems have been prepared. These compounds contain a 5-membered monoheteroaromatic ring at C-8. The antibacterial/synergistic and beta-lactamase inhibitory activities of both E- and Z-isomers and 2-substituted derivatives are compared.
TI  - The effect of bacterial products on human fibroblast and keratinocyte detachment  and viability.
AB  - An in vitro model has been developed to study the effect of soluble bacterial products on the viability and detachment of skin cell types utilized cultured grafts. Microbial products prepared from clinical isolates of bacterial species which most commonly colonize burn lesions showed marked variation in their ability to detach and kill both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. All three isolates of Acinetobacter spp. tested were effective in causing detachment and death of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, whereas Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. tested had little, or no, effect on detachment or viability for either skin cell type. Four Staphylococcus aureus isolates elicited variable strain-dependent results with regard to detachment and viability. One isolate possessed activity specific for keratinocyte detachment and death. These results indicate the possible undesirable effects such bacterial species may have on graft success in colonized burn wounds.
TI  - Nonspecific resistance-enhancing activity of zymosan in experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The nonspecific resistance-enhancing activity of zymosan on experimental bacterial (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus) infections was investigated. Zymosan, being of very low toxicity, significantly enhanced nonspecific resistance to the above bacteria. The enhancement was the most pronounced 2 to 5 days after zymosan treatment.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Model simulation of a single oral dose of cefuroxime axetil and the related in-vitro kill kinetics against four bacterial species.
AB  - An in-vitro model was shown to be capable of simulating a cefuroxime serum profile equivalent to that observed in human volunteer studies, following a single dose of 250 mg cefuroxime axetil. The model was used to carry out kill kinetic studies and showed cefuroxime to lyse the four bacterial test strains, time of onset of lysis being related to the sensitivity of the respective organisms. The more sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae strains were subject to a higher absolute kill and showed no regrowth over the duration of the simulated serum profile. In contrast, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli showed regrowth after 4 and 5 h respectively. The kill kinetic profiles of the respective organisms are discussed in relation to the pharmacokinetic analysis of the cefuroxime serum profile.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. II. Clinical observations].
AB  - A study was made of 92 bacteremia episodes among patients admitted to the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy) between June 1986 and September 1989. A single microorganism was isolated in 84 episodes (91.3%), the most common being: Staphylococcus aureus (21.7%), Escherichia coli (18.5%), Enterococcus (9.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (5.4%). The episodes were of both hospital and community origin: 54.3% vs. 45.7%. Their main sources were: the urinary tract (16.3%), abdominal infections (14.2%), endocarditis (7.6%), and the respiratory tract (5.5%). No source could be identified in 26%. Brucellosis, salmonellosis and listeriosis together constituted 8.7% of the episodes. Abdominal infections were primarily responsible for the 8 cases (8.7%) of polymicrobial bacteremia. The overall mortality was 18.5% (6.5% community vs. 12% hospital episodes). Mortality directly due to bacteremia was 8.7%. Bacteremia was the direct or indirect cause of death in 22.6% of patients greater than or equal to 65, compared with 19% and 10% in those aged 35-64 and 15-44 respectively. The patient's clinical picture at the time of infection was a prognostic factor: mortality was much lower in subjects previously healthy or free from basic diseases (11.8%) than in those with non-rapidly-fatal diseases (21.7%) or rapidly-fatal diseases (54.5%). Bacteremia-linked mortality (direct and indirect) was higher in Gram-positive vs Gram-negative infections: 22.2% vs 15.8%. Mortality was 12.5% in the group of patients with polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Correlation between disc potency and zone size in temafloxacin activity in vitro.
AB  - A multi-test disc potency evaluation of a new fluoroquinolone, temafloxacin, has  been prepared in order to evaluate the variation of the zone dimension with the disc antibiotic concentration. A direct correlation between these parameters has been demonstrated. All pathogens have been isolated in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Studies on the synthesis, characterisation and antimicrobial activity of new Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff base derived from ninhydrin and glycine.
AB  - For the first time, Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate Schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-N-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. These coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, NMR and electronic spectral studies. Mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. The experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the Schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. A molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. A comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.
TI  - [Stimulation of nonspecific antibacterial resistance of mice to opportunistic gram-negative microorganisms with triterpene glycosides from Holothuroidea].
AB  - A total fraction of triterpenic glycosides from Cucumaria japonica named cucumarioside was used as a stimulator of nonspecific resistance to bacterial infections in mice. After intraperitoneal administration to mice subsequently infected with various strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis, cucumarioside provided survival of 40 to 90 per cent of the infected animals against 100 per cent in the control group. The protective effect directly depended on the dose of cucumarioside. It was optimal to administer the preparation 3 days before the infection. When the preparation was administered at such periods LD50 for Neisseria meningitidis BT-2 and Salmonella minnesota SF 1111 lowered 5 and 4.3 times, respectively. Therefore, the total fraction of triterpenic glycosides from Far Eastern holothuria had a marked ability to increase natural resistance of the animals to infections caused by various gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - [Effectiveness and tolerance of cefixime in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis].
AB  - In a prospective, open clinical study, 50 urological patients with acute pyelonephritis were treated with the oral cephalosporin cefixime. The medication (2 x 200 mg/day) was given for seven to ten days. Clinical, bacteriological as well as hematological examinations were carried out prior to, during and immediately after therapy. A late check-up was performed five to nine days after the end of therapy. 46 of the 50 cases were evaluable for efficacy, and all 50 patients were included in safety evaluation. The most frequent pathogens isolated prior to therapy were Escherichia coli (34 times), Proteus mirabilis (six times), Klebsiella pneumoniae (twice) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (twice). Immediately after the end of therapy the pathogens were eradicated in 44 (97.5%) patients. At the late check-up the urine was sterile in 29 (63%) patients. A relapse was observed in 11 patients, a reinfection in four and the initially isolated pathogens had persisted in two. Immediately after the end of therapy 44 (95.7%) patients were clinically cured and two patients had improved. At the late check-up 41 patients were classified as clinically cured, three showed improvement, and two improvement with relapse. Adverse reactions (one case nausea and exanthem, and one case of meteorism) occurred in two patients. No changes in the blood counts or in the liver and kidney functions were observed. In the study described here cefixime proved to be an effective and well tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of upper urinary tract infections; it is of particular interest that 16 of the 50 patients presented with underlying disease favoring infection.
TI  - [The detection of a choleriform thermolabile enterotoxin in clinical strains of Proteus isolated in different infections].
AB  - The capacity of Proteus strains, isolated from patients with purulent inflammatory, urological and enteric infections, for the production of choleriform thermolabile enterotoxin was studied by means of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with the use of antitoxic serum to Escherichia coli enterotoxin. Out of 125 strains, 27 (21.6%) showed the capacity for producing choleriform thermolabile enterotoxin in EIA experiments. The results thus obtained indicate that EIA techniques can be used, in principle, for detecting the capacity of Proteus for the production of choleriform thermolabile enterotoxin.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis urease: nucleotide sequence determination and comparison with jack bean urease.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infection, produces a potent urease that hydrolyzes urea to NH3 and CO2, initiating kidney stone formation. Urease genes, which were localized to a 7.6-kilobase-pair region of DNA, were sequenced by using the dideoxy method. Six open reading frames were found within a region of 4,952 base pairs which were predicted to encode polypeptides of 31.0 (ureD), 11.0 (ureA), 12.2 (ureB), 61.0 (ureC), 17.9 (ureE), and 23.0 (ureF) kilodaltons (kDa). Each open reading frame was preceded by a ribosome-binding site, with the exception of ureE. Putative promoterlike sequences were identified upstream of ureD, ureA, and ureF. Possible termination sites were found downstream of ureD, ureC, and ureF. Structural subunits of the enzyme were encoded by ureA, ureB, and ureC and were translated from a single transcript in the order of 11.0, 12.2, and 61.0 kDa. When the deduced amino acid sequences of the P. mirabilis urease subunits were compared with the amino acid sequence of the jack bean urease, significant amino acid similarity was observed (58% exact matches; 73% exact plus conservative replacements). The 11.0-kDa polypeptide aligned with the N-terminal residues of the plant enzyme, the 12.2-kDa polypeptide lined up with internal residues, and the 61.0-kDa polypeptide matched with the C-terminal residues, suggesting an evolutionary relationship of the urease genes of jack bean and P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Antibacterial action of some saturated and unsaturated long-chain carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters in vitro].
AB  - Using the method of twofold serial dilution of substances in liquid nutrient medium with subsequent reseeding on solid nutrient medium a comparative study has been carried out of the antibacterial action in vitro of long chain saturated (C10-C18) and unsaturated (C11-C22) carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 Koph, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus 101+ and Proteus mirabilis 56. The compounds studied have an inhibitory effect upon the development of the microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranges from 1.8 to 19.3 mumol/ml. There exists a linear correlation between the length of the carbon chain (the number of C atoms) of the compounds and the minimum inhibitory concentration in the following cases: esters of saturated acids (C16-C24) and unsaturated acids (C11-C22) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; unsaturated acids (C11-C22) against Klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 Koph; esters of unsaturated acids (C17-C28) against Staphylococcus aureus 101+. This correlation has not been found in all other compounds against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Proteus mirabilis 56.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of KT3777, a new orally active carbacephem.
AB  - KT3777 is a novel carbacephem antibiotic structurally identical to cefaclor (CCL), except that the sulfur atom of position 1 of the cephem nucleus has been replaced by carbon. KT3777 was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with CCL, cephalexin (CEX) and amoxicillin. The MIC50 of KT3777 ranged from 0.2 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. KT3777 possessed an antibacterial spectrum and potency similar to that of CCL. However, against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, KT3777 was about twice as active as CCL. KT3777 was more active than CEX against all strains tested. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of KT3777 at concentrations above the MIC. KT3777 showed good affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1A, 1Bs, 3 and 4 of E. coli NIHJ JC-2. The protective effect of KT3777 against systemic infections in mice was comparable to that of CCL with a few exceptions and about 3 to 7 times greater than that of CEX. KT3777 also proved effective against localized infections such as acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice.
TI  - Functional analyses of Proteus mirabilis wild-type and mutant RecBCD enzymes in Escherichia coli reveal a new mutant phenotype.
AB  - Cloned into Escherichia coli the recB, recC and recD genes of Proteus mirabilis produce a recBCD enzyme (exoV) functional in recombination and DNA repair. The direction of transcription of recB, recC and recD, the sizes of the enzyme subunits, and their composition in the active enzyme are similar to that observed for the E. coli enzyme. In lambda crosses, the P. mirabilis enzyme has only about 40% of the Chi activity of the E. coli enzyme. The recBCD genes were also cloned from an exoV mutant of P. mirabilis which is u.v.-sensitive and partly deficient in exoV. The defect was attributed to the recB gene by complementation studies. In a recBCD deletion strain of E. coli, the enzyme from the mutant produced 40% of conjugational recombinants and had retained about 25% of Chi activity. However, it did not restore normal DNA repair, cell viability or recombination in lambda crosses and P1 transduction. The new mutant phenotype is discussed in the light of the assumption that prokaryotic recBCD enzymes can promote recombination in a Chi-dependent and a Chi-independent manner.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in serious infections. A prospective, controlled clinical trial with third-party blinding.
AB  - Oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections  due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. Thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). The severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. For ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). Isolated pathogens included: Escherichia coli (22/12), Klebsiella sp. (five/four), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), Haemophilus influenzae (one/one), Proteus mirabilis (two/zero), Proteus vulgaris (one/zero), Salmonella sp. (zero/two), Plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). The clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate, two/one. The bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one. Mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. A mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. Superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). The results presented suggest that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. An additional advantage seems to be a lower rate of superinfections.
TI  - Novel shuttle vectors for improved streptokinase expression in streptococci and bacterial L-forms.
AB  - Novel shuttle vectors of small size and increased copy number capable of replication in Escherichia coli, L-forms of Proteus mirabilis, and streptococci were constructed from a streptococcal erythromycin-resistant plasmid and an Escherichia coli phasmid. The streptokinase gene, skc, was inserted into one of them, and skc expression was studied in Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus lactis, and in an L-form strain (LVI) of Proteus mirabilis. The new streptokinase shuttle plasmid, pMLS10 (7.3 kb), specified higher Skc yields in all hosts when compared to pSM752 constructed previously. In particular Proteus mirabilis LVI(pMLS10) proved to be the most productive host, exhibiting complete secretion of the active protein at yields as high as 24000 unit per ml.
TI  - Formation of perinephric abscess following extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy.
AB  - We report 2 cases of perinephric abscess formation following extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). Possible mechanisms and preventative measures are discussed.
TI  - Glutathione transferase in bacteria: subunit composition and antigenic characterization.
AB  - The presence of glutathione transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) in Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 25422, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella oxytoca CIP 666, K. oxytoca AF 101, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085, Serratia marcescens CIP 6755, and Proteus mirabilis AF 2924 was investigated. Using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate, GST activity was found in the glutathione-(GSH-)affinity-purified fraction of all strains tested. SDS-PAGE analysis of GSH-affinity-purified enzyme indicated that the GSTs of all these bacteria are dimers of two identical subunits of Mr about 22,500. Rabbit antiserum directed against the major isoenzyme present in Proteus mirabilis AF 2924, Pm-GST-6.0, was used to investigate the antigenic properties of bacterial GSTs. Western blot analysis indicated that a GST antigenically identical to Pm-GST-6.0 is present in Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085, Escherichia coli ATCC 25422 and Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, but absent in Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella oxytoca CIP 666, K. oxytoca AF 101 and Serratia marcescens CIP 6755. The presence of Pm-GST-6.0, but not mammalian GST, increased the MIC values of amikacin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cephalothin and nalidixic acid for E. coli ATCC 25922. It is suggested that bacterial GST may represent a defense against the effects of antibiotics.
TI  - Comparison of two endometrial sampling devices. Cotton-tipped swab and double-lumen catheter with a brush.
AB  - The potential for bacterial contamination during transvaginal recovery of endometrial samples in patients with postpartum endomyometritis spawned an investigation into various protective measures and techniques. The confirmation and determination of the extent of contamination was attempted in 120 postpartum women with the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis. Each woman underwent endometrial sampling for bacterial culturing utilizing two devices--an unprotected, cotton-tipped swab and a protective, double-lumen catheter with a brush. Although a statistically greater number of bacterial species were recovered with the swab than with the brush (2.4 vs. 1.6, respectively [P less than .001]), they were not representative of species commonly thought of as causing cervicovaginal contamination. Individual species found with greater frequency with the swab were Streptococcus faecalis (P = .023), Escherichia coli (P = .007), Proteus mirabilis (P = .025), Bacteroides bivius (P less than .001 and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (P = .02). Thus, with proper cervical preparation and an extended-reach, transvaginal, cotton-tipped swab, true fundal specimens were obtained that provided a representative and cost-efficient sample of the infected endometrial cavity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR-830H), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. Piperacillin MICs were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2 or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. The higher concentration was generally more effective. Tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. Although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. MICs were reduced to the susceptible range for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against Morganella spp. Some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. The inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive Staphylococcus spp. and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. Combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. In particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 enzymes. In vitro activity was reflected in vivo. Tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the Morganella infection. Tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.
TI  - [Antibacterial effect of cefixime].
AB  - Cefixime (CFM) is a new hemi-synthetic orally active cephalosporin which exhibits a particular affinity for PBPs 3, 1a, 1bs. Its penetration through the Gram negative bacilli outer membrane is similar to that of third generation cephalosporins. The MICs were assessed by the agar dilution method against 2,489 bacterial strains collected in 10 hospitals. Against Enterobacteriaceae, MICs50 and 90 are respectively (mg/l): naturally non beta-lactamase-producing species: E. coli and Shigella: 0.25-0.5, Salmonella: 0.06 - 0.25, P. mirabilis: 0.008 - 0.0.32; chromosomal penicillinase producing species: Klebsiella: 0.06 - 2; chromosomal cephalosporinase producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii: 1 - greater than 128, S. marcescens: 0.25 - 16, Proteus indole: + 0.06 - 4, P. stuartii: 0.032 - 0.5. CFM activity is not altered in strains producing an acquired penicillinase. On the other hand, CFM appears to be inactive against cephalosporinase hyperproducing mutants and its activity is variably decreased against expanded spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. CFM is inactive against P. aeruginosa (MIC50 and 90: 64 - 128) and against A. baumannii (16 - 128). Haemophilus and gonococci, beta-lactamase producing or not, as well as meningococci, are highly susceptible to CFM (MIC 0.008 - 0.12). B. catarrhalis is usually inhibited by 0.03 to 0.5. CFM is moderately active against meticillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC50 and 90: 1-64), and inactive against meticillin-resistant strains. Enterococci are usually resistant, whereas streptococci and pneumococci are inhibited by low concentrations: 0.08 to 1. CFM is a bactericidal antibiotic, as shown by MBC and killing curves determination. These antibacterial properties relate CFM to the third generation cephalosporins and position the compound in an excellent place among the orally active cephalosporins.
TI  - Outpatient antimicrobial susceptibility: comparison with inpatient susceptibility patterns.
AB  - Because specific outpatient epidemiologic data on the susceptibility of organisms are not readily available to guide empiric antibiotic therapy in the ambulatory setting, we reviewed all positive culture reports of clinical specimens (n = 935) isolated exclusively from outpatients of the Eastern Carolina Family Practice Center over a 1-year period. Eighty percent were from urine cultures, 12 percent from wound cultures, and 5 percent from sputum cultures. An antibiogram was developed that showed a pattern of bacterial resistance similar to that reported elsewhere. More than 80 percent of urinary tract infections were caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50 percent of skin and soft tissue infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus species. Susceptibilities of these organisms were compared with those reported by the local hospital, and antimicrobial resistance patterns were similar, which suggests that the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can follow susceptibility patterns derived from either inpatient or outpatient laboratories in areas with similar resistance patterns. Further research into the epidemiology and susceptibility of organisms isolated from outpatients is needed. Whether the susceptibility of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial resistance found in this investigation can be extrapolated to other geographic areas remains to be determined.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Hygienic status of food handlers.
AB  - The study demonstrated bacterial species on hands and nails of food-handlers before and after hand-washing. Those were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Diphtheroid, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Citrobacter freundii. Before hand washing, each food-handler harboured one to eight bacterial species. After hand-washing (eight with water from plastic boxes, 97 from pipe water, 57 out of 97 (58.8%) used soap or detergent with water), disappearance of one to four bacterial strains from hands and nails were found in 47.6 per cent of food-handlers. Cultures of water used for washing from eight plastic boxes yielded Staph. spp., Strep. spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Kleb.pneumoniae, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae. From pipe water, Diphtheroid in 4, 4.1 per cent Micrococcus in 1, 1.03 per cent were shown. Comparing bacterial species found in food-handlers with long nails and short nails, 4-8 more species were revealed in the former than the latter for 35.7 per cent. After hand-washing, there was recontamination of bacterial species in 17 food-handlers. This was probably due to dirty napkins or dresses during hand-drying or from water in plastic boxes.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  - Meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. All antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. Generalized infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. Immunocompromised mice infected with Ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. Those given a greater challenge of Ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. Treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of E. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. Infection with Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. Lung infections caused by Ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. These results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.
TI  - Epitope specificities of murine monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides of the Re chemotype.
AB  - Murine monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Re mutants of Salmonella minnesota, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli were serologically characterized. Using natural Re LPS and natural and synthetic partial structures thereof, representing the 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO) or lipid A region or both, the epitope specificities of four monoclonal antibodies were defined. Clones 20 (immunoglobulin M [IgM]) and 25 (IgG3) recognize a terminal alpha-pyranosidically linked KDO monosaccharide residue and the alpha-2,4-linked KDO disaccharide, respectively, as the immunodominant group. Therefore, these two antibodies are core antibodies which do not require the presence of lipid A constituents for binding. The minimal structure enabling binding of clone 17 (IgG2b) is a pseudotetrasaccharide of the sequence alpha-KDO-(2----4)-alpha-KDO-(2----6)-beta-glucosamine-(1----6)- glucosaminitol with two amide-linked 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues. The smallest structure with which clone 22 (IgG3) reacted was de-O-acylated Re LPS. Therefore, clones 17 and 22 are LPS antibodies requiring both the lipid A and the KDO region for binding. Phosphoryl residues of the lipid A moiety in Re LPS are dispensable for the reaction with clone 17, whereas they are necessary for that with clone 22. These four different antibody types were also detected in polyclonal rabbit antisera and could be distinguished from each other by absorption experiments. It was found that type 20 and 25 antibodies either were not present or were present only in small amounts and that the majority of the antibodies were of types 17 and 22. From these data, we conclude that the immunodominant structures of Re LPS comprise both the KDO and lipid A domains.
TI  - [Experimental study of a new biological preparation for treating E. coli infection and Proteus dysbacteriosis in young infants].
AB  - The action of a new biological preparation intended for the treatment of E. coli  infection and Proteus dysbacteriosis in children has been studied in experiments on mice and suckling rabbits. The protective activity of anti-E. coli and anti-Proteus lactoglobulin has been found to exceed that of normal lactoglobulin 6- to 13-fold. When subjected to the action of proteolytic enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract, the preparation retains its preventive properties on the level of the native preparation, which confirms the possibility of the oral administration of the preparation in clinical practice without protecting it from the proteolytic action of the enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - In bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpodoxime proxetil  (CPDX-PR, CS-807), the following results were obtained: 1. Antibacteriological activity Antibacteriological activity of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, cefroxadine (CXD), cefazolin (CEZ), cephalothin (CET) and amoxicillin (AMPC) were studied against clinical isolated bacteria following as: Staphylococcus aureus (resistant or sensitive of methicillin), Escherichia coli (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Klebsiella pneumoniae (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. Antibacterial activities of CXD and CET, however, were not tested against methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. R-3746 showed stronger activities than any of the other oral antibiotics against these strains except S. aureus against which it showed slightly less activity than AMPC. Most frequent MIC values of R-3746 to S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were 1.56, 0.39, less than or equal to 0.10 and less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. Against isolated strains of MRSA, MICs of R-3746 were higher than 25 micrograms/ml with 23 strains (77%), which were similar to MIC values of CCL and AMPC against these organisms. MIC values of R-3746 against CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were superior to MICs of other antibiotics, and the MIC50 value was 0.20 micrograms/ml. Against many isolated strains of E. cloacae MIC values of R-3746 were relatively high ranging 0.78 to greater than 100 micrograms/ml. MIC50 of R-3746 against E. cloacae was 12.5 micrograms/ml. 2. Absorption and excretion Serum concentration and urinary excretion of CPDX (the active form of CPDX-PR) were studied upon single oral administration of CPDX-PR at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100 mg (tablet). The peak of serum concentration of CPDX was attained in 1-6 hours 1-4 hours and 2-6 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at the 3 different dosage levels, and they were 0.99-2.99 micrograms/ml, 4.30-7.05 micrograms/ml and 1.65-2.93 micrograms/ml, respectively. At 8 hours after administration, mean concentrations of CPDX for the 3 groups were 0.31, 0.83 and 0.66 micrograms/ml, respectively. As the average AUC's for the 3 groups were 8.16, 25.97 and 10.79 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates of CPDX for the 3 groups were 20.9-56.2, 28.3-49.7 and 35.1-50.4%, respectively in the first 8 hours after administration.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin against strains  isolated from clinical material].
AB  - The susceptibility of 392 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical material of hospitalized patients in Institute for Chest Diseases Golnik were studied. 100 strains of Escherichia coli, 56 strains of Enterobacter spp., 40 strains of Proteus mirabilis, 50 strains of Gram negative nonfermentative bacteria, 46 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin were determined by agar dilution test. The susceptibility of tested strains is greater to ciprofloxacin, except susceptibility of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, which is greater to pefloxacin. Strains of nonfermentative bacteria have lower susceptibility to both quinolones.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Australia with special reference to sulbactam/ampicillin.
AB  - A survey of antibiotic resistance in Australian states was undertaken by the Microbiology Quality Assurance Program of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. Data were obtained from hospitals and private pathology laboratories serving both in-patients and out-patients at community hospitals. The study showed that resistance varied from state to state; it was highest in the Eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, and lowest in Tasmania and Western Australia. In South Australia, isolates of Escherichia coli demonstrated a high degree of cefoxitin resistance. Western Australia and Tasmania showed high levels of gentamicin resistance for Klebsiella spp., as well as trimethoprim resistance in Proteus mirabilis. The relationship between erythromycin resistance and clindamycin resistance also differed among various states. These studies demonstrated the activity of sulbactam/ampicillin against a wide variety of common pathogenic bacteria in which resistance was mediated by beta-lactamase.
TI  - Sulbactam: secondary mechanisms of action.
AB  - Light and scanning electron microscopy showed that 0.25, 0.5 and 1 times the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sulbactam (SULB) caused filament formation in different species of Enterobacteriaceae, while 2 and 4 times the MICs caused spheroplast formation and subsequent lysis. By using a competitive assay with 125I-penicillin X, SULB showed a primary affinity for the PBP 1a and PBP3 of Escherichia coli, as well as for the PBP1a of Proteus mirabilis. The bactericidal interaction of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and SULB against E. coli K-1 resistant to the bactericidal activity of human serum was studied in vitro; however, SULB concentrations showed variations in the medium according to human kinetic data. Under these conditions, bacterial growth occurred in Hanks balanced salt solution containing SULB, PMN, or SULB-PMN in combination. In addition, bactericidal activity was observed in serum, with a killing rate of 90% for PMN or SULB, and 95% for SULB-PMN in combination. The postantibiotic enhancement of PMN bactericidal function was assessed against E. coli K1 pretreated with 0.5 the MIC of SULB (32 micrograms/ml) for 0.5 hr. The 90% bacterial killing rate of PMN occurred by 1.5 hr for pretreated bacteria and by 2.5 hr for untreated bacteria. Furthermore, the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) assay using an E. coli stimulus showed that SULB does not modify PMN activity.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Monoadduct forming photochemical reagents for labeling nucleic acids for hybridization.
AB  - We describe the synthesis of three angelicin derivatives which can be used for labeling nucleic acids with biotin. These compounds were used to label nucleic acids in the presence of lysed cell constituents. The resulting labelled nucleic acids show hybridization to a genus specific probe for E. coli. The relative comparison of sensitivity indicates that a polyamine linker is better than a polyethylene oxide linker between the biotin and angelicin moieties.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against three different enterobacterial outer membrane proteins. Characterization, cross-reactivity, and binding to bacteria.
AB  - BALB/c mice were immunized with whole-cells of Escherichia coli 055:B5 or Proteus mirabilis NCTC 60 to produce broadly cross-reacting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against outer membrane (OM) proteins. A total of 10 anti-OM MAbs of the IgG class were selected. These included 5 MAbs against the heat-modifiable (Hm) protein, 3 against the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PALp), and 2 against Braun's lipoprotein (BLp). Based on competition ELISA, the MAbs defined 2 Hm protein binding sites (Hm I and Hm II), 2 PALp sites (PALp I and PALp II), and one BLp site (BLp I). The MAbs showed broad cross-reactivity against 74 strains of 10 different genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. Non-cross-reacting enteric bacilli occurred only among bacteria of the genera Salmonella, Proteus, and Providentia. The results revealed that Proteus and Providentia strains differed from other enteric bacilli with regard to BLp synthesis or specificity. A panel of 30 non-enteric Gram-negative bacteria did not cross-react. Testing of MAb binding to bacteria showed that a part of the BLp I, PALp I, and PALp II sites was immunoaccessible in intact homologous bacteria, and that the Hm I and Hm II epitopes were inaccessible. The MAbs should facilitate studies of structure and immunobiological function of enterobacterial OM proteins and should have a potential as immunodiagnostic reagents.
TI  - Results of microbiological investigations on the permeability of procedure and surgical gloves.
AB  - Procedure gloves are considered to be important to prevent infections when handling potentially contaminated items. We tested two sorts of vinyl- and 4 sorts of polyethylene-copolymer-gloves, 20 gloves of each, towards the ability of Proteus mirabilis ATCC 15143 to penetrate the glove material. The gloves were fastened in bottles containing 700 ml sterile nutrient broth and then filled with 300 ml of a bacteria suspension having a density of 10(8) cfu/ml. The samples were taken directly and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 24 h after starting the test. Immediately after the inoculation in 10 to 85% of the gloves a migration of Proteus mirabilis could be detected. After 24 h the rate was 25 to 90%! The penetration of Escherichia coli-lambda-phages (10(6) pfu/ml) was investigated in a similar arrangement. Here 20 to 90% of the gloves were previous in the first 5 to 10 min. Additionally tested latex gloves were impermeable up to 4 h after inoculation. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to improve glove materials. To examine the impermeability for microorganisms the methods used in this investigation are recommended as quality control procedures.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. In the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. The more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml) of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). Cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. Due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). As a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.
TI  - Rapid flow cytometric bacterial detection and determination of susceptibility to  amikacin in body fluids and exudates.
AB  - A flow cytometry-based method for rapid and quantitative detection of bacteria in various clinical specimens and for rapid determination of antibiotic effect is described. Achieving such a measurement with high sensitivity required discrimination between bacteria and other particles which were often present in clinical samples in high concentrations. This discrimination was facilitated by detecting the bacterial characteristic light scatter and fluorescence signals following staining, e.g., with the fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dye ethidium bromide, as well as by measuring bacterial proliferation during short time intervals. Antibiotic susceptibility was measured by observing the inhibition of such proliferation. The method was applied to 43 clinical specimens from various sources, such as wound exudates, bile, serous cavity fluids, and bronchial lavage. Bacterial detection, achieved in less than 2 h, agreed with results of conventional methods with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 88%. Susceptibility to amikacin was detected in 1 h in 92% of 13 positive specimens.
TI  - [Abscess of the psoas muscle and the thigh: report of a case].
AB  
TI  - Elevated serum prostate-specific antigen due to acute bacterial prostatitis.
AB  - Elevated serum prostate-specific antigen secondary to acute bacterial prostatitis occurred in 2 patients. This cause of increased PSA has not been documented previously.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin, was evaluated against various strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined on three consecutive days with an inoculum of 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or a culture in the logarithmic growth phase. The results found tigemonam to be rapidly bactericidal against most Enterobacteriaceae isolated. In addition, the killing curves indicated a synergism between tigemonam and subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - Postpartum bacteriuria. A multicenter evaluation of different screening procedures and a controlled short-course treatment trial with amoxycillin.
AB  - A total of 10,909 puerperal women from 6 different hospitals were screened for bacteriuria by culture of voided midstream urine (MSU), and a significant growth was found in 881 patients (8.1%). In 731 cases the urine was reexamined by using suprapubic aspiration (SPA), and in only 354 (48%) of the samples the diagnosis of bacteriuria was confirmed. The contamination rate of the MSU samples varied from 46 to 69% between the different hospitals, indicating that in the postpartum period positive MSU findings would necessitate more thorough examination in order to confirm the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. In our study, suprapubic aspiration was found to be a simple and acceptable method without any side effects. Confirmed bacteriuria occurred in 3.2% of the women. Operative delivery (Cesarean section, forceps and vacuum extractor delivery), epidural anesthesia and bladder catheterization increased the risk of bacteriuria in the postpartum period. Only 27% of the women with positive bladder urine complained of dysuria and this symptom was significantly more common in women who had been catheterized. 230 patients with confirmed bacteriuria with amoxycillin-sensitive bacterias participated in a randomized short-course treatment trial: 114 women received 3 days treatment with amoxycillin (1.5 g/day), 116 received the traditional 10 days therapy (750 mg amoxycillin/day). Both antibiotic regimens were observed to be effective with a cure rate of 96 and 98%, respectively. Short-course antibiotic treatment should thus be recommended to puerperal women with urinary tract infections since this avoids prolonged drug exposure to the lactating mother.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  - Sulbactam/Cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in Japan and U.S.A., respectively. After an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of CPZ and SBT in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. In urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. Antimicrobial interaction studies using various combinations of CPZ and SBT were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of SBT on the antimicrobial activity of CPZ in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. Antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. SBT increased the activity of CPZ against various clinical isolates tested except Enterococcus faecalis. CPZ-SBT at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of CPZ, resulting in decreases in MIC values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. These drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. Therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. Based on pharmacokinetic data for CPZ and SBT, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of CPZ-SBT at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in Japan and U.S.A., respectively, are appropriate. The effect of SBT on the activity of CPZ was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. SBT/CPZ, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum size were as follows: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, Staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and E. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. Those of Gram-negative bacilli were: Escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, Proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, Serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and Acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.
TI  - Effects of microamperage, medium, and bacterial concentration on iontophoretic killing of bacteria in fluid.
AB  - Prevention of nosocomial urinary tract infections by iontophoresis is addressed.  An iontophoretic generator was used to provide microamperage (10 to 400 microA) to vials containing either synthetic urine or supplemented synthetic urine. Bacteria were added to vials, and parameters of growth, bacterial killing, and multiple electrode materials were examined. Escherichia coli and Proteus species were both inhibited and killed at various microamperages and with several electrode types, the most efficient being gold-gold as the anode-cathode combination. Klebsiella pneumoniae in supplemented synthetic urine was least inhibited in growth, and higher microamperage (200 to 400 microA) was most effective in killing the bacteria. Bacterial growth reduction and killing were directly related to increasing microamperage and were inversely related to bacterial concentration.
TI  - Review of the in-vitro spectrum and characteristics of cefmetazole (CS-1170).
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial qualities of cefmetazole are summarized from a review  of over 30 publications. Cefmetazole, a 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, is shown to have an antimicrobial spectrum closely resembling cefoxitin's. However, cefmetazole is approximately two- to eight-fold more active than cefoxitin against commonly isolated species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, pyogenic streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus influenzae. Cefmetazole is also active against anaerobic pathogens, Neisseria spp., Citrobacter diversus, indole-positive Proteus spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis. Cefmetazole is bactericidal against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Its MICs and MBCs are minimally influenced by high inoculum concentrations. beta-Lactamases failed to hydrolyze cefmetazole significantly and cefmetazole is considered the most stable of the cephamycin drugs. Some Bacteroides strains produce beta-lactamases that are uniquely inhibited by cefmetazole. In-vitro tests with cefmetazole have been evaluated and interpretive criteria established for NCCLS methods: susceptible greater than or equal to 18 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). The consistent cross-resistance and -susceptibility observed between cefmetazole and cefoxitin requires the testing of only one of these agents routinely. Quality control guidelines for cefmetazole disc diffusion (30 micrograms disc) and dilution tests are summarized in this review.
TI  - Comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - A monoclonal antibody against the Yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (CRPA), was obtained by cell fusion. The CRPA common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from Y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (IgG1) thus obtained. The purified CRPA showed a single band of 60 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reacted with rabbit antisera against Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei in Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kDa peptide from Y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such as V. cholerae, E. coli, S. sonnei, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. The results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on a CRPA molecule.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - [Perinephric phlegmon. Current aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Apropos of 20  cases].
AB  - The authors report a series of twenty patients presenting with perinephric abscess. Percutaneous management was performed in 4 cases. Considering the benefit of the modern imaging techniques, the authors discuss the current diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic modalities of this disease.
TI  - Morphological lesions of the rat urinary tract induced by inoculation of mycoplasmas and other urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The effects on the urinary tract after inoculation of Ureaplasma urealyticum into the rat bladder were evaluated and compared to that seen after Mycoplasma hominis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis inoculation. The inoculation of the urease-producing organisms P. mirabilis and U. urealyticum were associated with the formation of struvite bladder stones and predominantly hyperplastic lesions of the bladder. The P. mirabilis inoculated rats also displayed marked pyelonephritis. A similar but much less pronounced reaction also occurred in the kidneys of some of the U. urealyticum inoculated rats. P. mirabilis could frequently be recultured. In contrast, this was not possible with U. urealyticum, but the organism was detected by scanning electron microscopy 2 weeks after the inoculation. Inoculation of M. hominis was associated with a few mild lesions of the bladder, but inflammatory lesions were not present in the kidneys. The study confirms the potential of Ureaplasma to form struvite stones in rat urinary tract. It also demonstrates that it can induce inflammatory changes in both bladder and kidney of rats without concomitant stone formation.
TI  - Potencies of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime in a single chamber pharmacokinetic system simulating their in vivo half-lives.
AB  - Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are third-generation cephalosporins with similar in vitro potencies and spectra. However, previous studies have shown that ceftriaxone had superior in vivo activity (mouse PD50 values greater than or equal to 2-fold lower) compared to cefotaxime in 23 of 46 tested enterobacteriaceae. This superior activity was thought to be due to ceftriaxone's 5- to 8-fold longer half-life. The relationship between half-life (ceftriax-one 6 h, cefotaxime 1 h) and potency was examined by following bacterial kill curves in a single chamber, open-ended perfusion model over an 8-hour period. Both antibiotics were compared for efficacy at both half-lives against four gram-negative bacteria. For two of the bacterial strains antibiotic potency differences in the perfusion model were determined largely by pharmacokinetics. For the other two strains intrinsic bacterial and antibiotic properties were of prime importance.
TI  - Chronic urinary tract infection and renal stones.
AB  - In patients with bacteriuria and small and otherwise asymptomatic renal stones, the infection should be linked to the stone before surgical removal of the stone is considered. In this study the level of infection was determined by ureteric catheterisation. The method could discriminate between stone-related infections (70%) and infections confined to the lower urinary tract (30%) in virtually all of the patients. Even very small stones (3 mm) were shown to be the cause of decade-long bacteriurias. The results of operative stone removal were encouraging, with eradication of the infection in 87% of the patients with stone-related infection.
TI  - Evaluation of the Cobas-Bact system for direct and rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative rods from positive blood culture broths.
AB  - A direct antimicrobial susceptibility test and a direct identification of positive blood culture broths for gram-negative rods confirmed with Gram stain by using a new instrument, Cobas-Bact, were compared with the conventional Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion disk method and with the in-house set of identification or API 20E, respectively. The bacterial pellet of centrifuged positive blood culture broth was used to inoculate a Cobas-Bact susceptibility and identification rotor. Bacteria from 206 cases of monomicrobial septicemia due to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested. In 198 episodes (96%), direct identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were obtained for the same bacterial pathogen within 5 h of detection. Of 204 direct identifications obtained, 177 (86.6%) were "high-confidence" correct identifications (percentage of likelihood [P] greater than or equal to 80%) and 25 (12.5%) "low-confidence" correct identifications (P less than 80%), whereas only 2 misidentifications occurred (1 Escherichia coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis). Direct susceptibility testing was performed in 199 episodes (96%), providing 1,885 antibiotic-microorganism combinations. Full agreement reached 86.3%, and essential agreement reached 92.8%. Minor discrepancies were found in 120 (6.5%) of the tests, major discrepancies were found in 127 (6.8%) tests, and very major discrepancies were found in only 7 (0.4%) tests. Subsequent MIC determinations in cases of major or very major discrepancies reduced the number of major discrepancies involving cephalosporins from 60 to 16, whereas all those involving aminoglycosides remained. Overall, this direct and rapid Cobas-Bact identification and susceptibility testing procedure offered accurate information with 5 to 6 h after the laboratory detection of bacteremia and septicemia due to members of the Enterobacteriacease.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Effects of the pH and the urine infected by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis on chromic catgut, polyglycolic acid and polyglactin 910: study in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of the pH and the urine infected by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis on chromic catgut, polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polyglactin 910 (P910), we divided the experiment into three steps. In the first step, the behavior of suture material immersed in sterile urine, urine infected by E. coli and urine infected by P. mirabilis and in culture environment infected by P. mirabilis was studied. The physical features were observed continuously up to the 6th day. In the second step, every element of the urea-splitting reaction was isolatedly studied , without the presence of bacterial agents. And in the last step, that reaction was mimetized in sterile environments and in environments with acid and alkaline pH. While the chromic catgut was kept integral in all the environments, the PGA and the P910 dissolved in urine infected by Proteus, which was caused by the ammonia resulting from the urea-splitting reaction. This dissolution was also observed in sterile environment (mimetization of the urea-splitting reaction by urease, with no Proteus). The destruction of the sutures was not influenced by the pH variance.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection at the emergency service of a third level hospital].
AB  - 104 patients with (UI) non-complicated urinary infection, diagnosed at the emergency department of a third level hospital, are presented. The median age (x +/- DE) was of 58.12 +/- 20, 48 years; 78 were female (73%) and 22 male. 81 had fever and/or micturitional syndrome, the rest of the patients were without symptoms. The most frequent germ was escherichia coli, which was isolated in 80 patients (84.6%) followed by proteus mirabilis in 9 patients (8.6%) and enterococo in 2 patients (1.9%), other differing germs were also isolated, one for each remaining case. The only active antibiotic "in vitro" for all the germs isolated was gentamicin; other showed varying resistance. The best effectivity "in vivo" was also obtained with gentamicin followed by cotrimoxazole, despite the resistance which was superior to cefalexin. There were no deaths reported during the ambulatory treatment. We concluded that non-complicated UI can be treated in an ambulatory regimen. The most effective antibiotic is gentamicin, cotrimoxazole being a valid alternative.
TI  - [Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in an adolescent].
AB  - One case of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis diagnosed following nephrectomy is described, considering its outstanding characteristics such as male adolescent, right kidney, involvement with normal function and without pathological history for which there is no explanation to date. This disease usually occurs in women 60 years or older, suggesting a renal tumor. In 50% of the cases, urine cultures are positive for Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis; in accordance with different reports renal tissue cultures are positive in more than 90%. Malnutrition, calcification, urolithiasis and renal failure with hydronephrosis are common findings. The left kidney is more frequently involved. The etiology is unclear: many hypotheses are discussed, with malnutrition and peroxidase deficit as important causes.
TI  - High resolution deuterium NMR studies of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - High resolution deuterium NMR spectra were obtained from suspensions of five bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Deuterium-labeled D-glucose at C-1, C-2, and C-6 was used to monitor dynamically anaerobic metabolism. The flux of glucose through the various bacterial metabolic pathways could be determined by following the disappearance of glucose and the appearance of the major end products in the 2H NMR spectrum. The presence of both labeled and unlabeled metabolites could be detected using 1H NMR spectroscopy since the proton resonances in the labeled species are shifted upfield due to an isotopic chemical shift effect. The 1H-1H scalar coupling observed in both the 2H and 1H NMR spectra was used to assign definitively the resonances of labeled species. An increase in the intensity of natural abundance deuterium signal of water can be used to monitor pathways in which a deuteron is lost from the labeled metabolite. The steps in which label loss can occur are outlined, and the influence these processes have on the ability of 2H NMR spectroscopy to monitor metabolism are assessed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetics, safety and effects on bacterial infection of sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were evaluated in 17 children. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetics in 3 children receiving a single dose of 10 mg per kg body weight were evaluated. The half-life of ampicillin (ABPC) was 1.38 +/- 0.14 hours and that of sulbactam was 0.93 +/- 0.26 hour. 2. Fourteen cases, including 7 tonsillitis, 2 pharyngitis, 2 bronchitis, and 1 each of cystitis, scarlet fever and cellulitis were treated with SBTPC fine granule. The clinical efficacy rate was 100%. 3. Bacteriological efficacies classified by causative organisms were evaluated in 5 children. Staphylococcus aureus was responsible in 3 cases, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1 case, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in 1 case. Eradication rate was 100%. SBTPC was more active than ABPC against ABPC-resistant strains and almost equal to or more active than cephalexin or cefaclor. 4. The only abnormal laboratory test value observed was eosinophilia in 2 children. No side effects were recorded. From the above results it is concluded that SBTPC fine granule is one of first choices of effective, useful and safe antibiotics for the treatment of infections in pediatric field.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Fleroxacin in single dose oral therapy of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection.
AB  - A randomized comparative study was performed in twenty women with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI). They received a single oral dose of either fleroxacin 600 mg or amoxycillin 3 g. Pathogens were Escherichia coli (17), Proteus mirabilis (2) and Staphylococcus aureus (1). A complete clinical and microbiological cure was observed in all patients of both groups. One patient in the fleroxacin group had gastric irritation. A single oral dose of fleroxacin may be suitable for the treatment of lower UTI even when it is due to organisms resistant to amoxycillin and other traditional oral antimicrobials.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of a new oral carbacephem, LY163892.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new oral carbacephem, LY163892, was compared with cefaclor, cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and selected penicillins against 529 bacterial isolates. LY163892 exhibited greater activity in vitro than all four cephalosporins against Haemophilus influenzae, beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis. LY163892 had equivalent potency to cefaclor against non-beta-lactamase producing B. catarrhalis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Group D beta-haemolytic streptococci, Proteus vulgaris, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci were universally resistant to LY163892 and the four cephalosporins. Broth dilution experiments indicated that LY163892 was bactericidal against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms and suggested that the antibiotic had a similar degree of stability to the beta-lactamases of H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis and Staph. aureus as did cefaclor. The susceptibility of 16 strains of H. influenzae to LY163892 and cefaclor were equivalent when estimated using three different commercially available agar media. Addition of carbon dioxide to the incubation atmosphere significantly reduced the potency of both drugs.
TI  - [The frequency of isolating urinary infection germs at a community practice and their sensitivity to various antibiotics].
AB  - Nine hundred and thirty one urine's specimens of patients affected by urinary infection have been studied by pathology practising in different towns in France. The most frequently germs retrieved are: Escherichia coli 76%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, Klebsiella 5%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 2%. Were studied Gram negative rods sensibility to ampicillin (A), cephalosporin 1st generation (C), nalidixic acid (Nal), gentamicin (G), norfloxacin (Norf); Gram positive cocci resistance to oxacillin (Oxa), erythromycin (E), pristinamycin (P), gentamicin (G), norfloxacin (Norf). For E. coli: the resistance was 24% A, 2% C1, 0.1% G, 4% Nal, 0.1% Norf. For Klebsiella: the resistance was respectively 96% A, 12% C1, 10% Nal, 18% G., 4% Norf. For P. mirabilis: 11% A, 3% C1, 0% Nal, 9% G, 0% Norf. E. coli strains cephalo R; Gram negative rods Genta R or quinolone R; staphylocoque oxa R or pristina R have been checked by HIA Begin microbiology laboratory. Discrepancies in results have been analysed. This study enabled the participants to improve their bacteriological technic, antibiogramm's reading, results' interpretation.
TI  - A double-blind, multicenter, comparative study of the safety and efficacy of cefixime versus amoxicillin in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections in adult patients.
AB  - In this 31-site multicenter trial, 565 adult patients with urinary tract infections were randomly assigned to receive either a 10-day course of cefixime 400 mg once daily (n = 279) or amoxicillin 250 mg three times daily (n = 286). Although all patients were included in the safety analysis, only 93 (33 percent) cefixime-treated and 99 (35 percent) amoxicillin-treated patients were fully evaluable for the efficacy analysis. One week after therapy, the evaluable patients treated with cefixime demonstrated a 90 percent clinical cure rate and a 92 percent eradication rate of the baseline pathogen. This compared with an 83 percent clinical cure rate and an 84 percent bacterial eradication rate in the amoxicillin-treated group. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (80 percent) followed by Proteus mirabilis (10 percent). One hundred thirty-seven (49 percent) of the 279 cefixime-treated and 126 (44 percent) of the 286 amoxicillin-treated patients reported at least one adverse experience during the study. Adverse reactions associated with cefixime were similar to those reported for other beta-lactam antibiotics. The most frequent adverse experiences reported by cefixime-treated patients were diarrhea (15 percent) and stool changes (12 percent). Headaches (11 percent) and diarrhea (9 percent) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions by the amoxicillin-treated patients. Eleven cefixime-treated patients (3.9 percent) and 10 amoxicillin-treated patients (3.5 percent) discontinued therapy because of adverse experiences. Results of this study demonstrate that a once-daily regimen of cefixime is as safe and effective as a three-times-daily regimen of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections. Although the incidence of bowel changes was somewhat higher in the cefixime treatment group, these events usually resolved when therapy was discontinued.
TI  - Effect of circumcision status on periurethral bacterial flora during the first year of life.
AB  - To determine whether bacterial colonization is a factor in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, we compared the periurethral bacterial flora of uncircumcised versus circumcised boys during the first year of life. Intraurethral and circumferential glans cultures were obtained from 25 circumcised and 25 uncircumcised infants at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 months of age. Different children were used at each age (300 total). The types of bacteria and the total and specific colony counts were compared. The results of the glans cultures were similar to those from the urethra. Uncircumcised boys had significantly higher total colony counts (p less than 0.003) at all ages except 12 months. Escherichia coli was present significantly more often (p less than 0.01) in the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. Gram-negative uropathogenic organisms (Klebsiella-enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultured more frequently (p less than 0.0005) from the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. The specific colony counts for E. coli and the other uropathogenic organisms were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) at all ages except 12 months. We conclude that during the first 6 months of life, the presence of a foreskin is associated with a greater quantity of periurethral bacteria and a greater likelihood for the presence of, as well as higher concentrations of, potentially uropathogenic organisms.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of LY163892, an orally administered 1-carbacephem.
AB  - LY163892 was found to be similar to cefaclor and slightly superior to cephalexin  in antimicrobial activity and spectrum. Bacteria with MIC50 less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Streptococcus spp. Strains that produced plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases generally remained susceptible to LY163892. LY163892 was found to be bactericidal in general, but its MICs for some bacterial strains were adversely affected by increased inocula.
TI  - [Susceptibility of gram-negative bacterial isolates to six beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics at our university hospital].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the University Hospital in 1987 to six beta-Lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. Results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. Most of the strains belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. They were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Most strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. More than half of the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in Pseudomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  - PURPOSE: Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia is defined as two or more episodes of bacteremia occurring in the same patient with an infection-free interval between each episode. Our purpose was to identify patients with recurrent gram-negative bacteremia in order to define possible risk factors for its recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a recently completed prospective study of all episodes of gram-negative bacteremia at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Center between April 1, 1984, and May 31, 1987, 35 patients with 74 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia were identified. The following information was obtained from all 35 patients: age, service, date of hospital admission, date of the bacteremia, underlying diseases, initial antimicrobial therapy, focus of infection, the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobial susceptibility of the blood isolate, and outcome. RESULTS: All 35 patients were men, had a mean age of 69 years, and all had one or more underlying diseases; 45 percent had a malignancy. The duration of time between a pair of episodes was four weeks or more for 74 percent of 38 pairs of episodes. In 25 of 38 (66 percent) pairs of episodes, the focus of infection was the same; in 80 percent of these 25 pairs, the urinary tract was the focus. Overall, the urinary tract was the focus of gram-negative bacteremia in almost 50 percent. Escherichia coli was the single most common organism isolated (28 percent of all episodes), followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5 percent) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5 percent). Six of 35 (17 percent) patients died due to gram-negative bacteremia; five of these six had a respiratory tract focus of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of veterans, recurrent gram-negative bacteremia was identified in almost 10 percent of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia during a 37-month study period. Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia most frequently occurred in the setting of underlying malignancy with the urinary tract as a common focus of infection. The mortality rate of 17 percent was similar to that of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia reported in previous studies.
TI  - Adherence of urease-induced crystals to rat bladder epithelium following acute infection with different uropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Apart from urine supersaturation with respect to struvite and calcium phosphate,  crystal retention is considered to be necessary for the formation of infection stones. This study was performed to investigate the role of the mucous coat in rat bladders in the adhesion of sterile urease-induced crystals and to determine to what extent the adhesion was influenced by infection. Elimination of the mucous coat with 0.1 M HCl increased the adherence of crystals six times compared to that in bladders with an intact mucous coat. Infection with Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Ureaplasma urealyticum increased the adherence six, five, four and two times, respectively. Injury to the mucous coat may thus be one mechanism by which microorganisms can contribute to the formation of infection stones in the urinary tract.
TI  - In vitro activity of the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole compared  with that of other chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - For many years now, the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (active ingredients of Bactrim) has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, Haemophilus influenza, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Citrobacter. In this comparative study, the antibacterial activity of the combination against 2,229 gram-negative and 1,338 gram-positive strains encountered in domiciliary practice was tested and compared with that of other commonly used antimicrobials. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in microtitre plates using serial dilutions. With regard to the gram-negative strains, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, with an MIC90 of less than 2 mg/l for most isolates, was the most active substance apart from norfloxacin. The combination also had a powerful inhibitory effect on gram-positive strains, the MIC90 being between 2 and 4 mg/l for all strains except Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - [Urinary levels of ammonium-magnesium phosphate and calcium phosphate in patients with infected urinary calculi].
AB  
TI  - Proteus mirabilis urease: genetic organization, regulation, and expression of structural genes.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection, produces urease, an important virulence factor for this species. The enzyme hydrolyzes urea to CO2 and NH3, which initiates struvite or apatite stone formation. Genes encoding urease were localized on a P. mirabilis chromosomal DNA gene bank clone in Escherichia coli by deletion analysis, subcloning, Bal31 nuclease digestion, transposon Tn5 mutagenesis, and in vitro transcription-translation. A region of DNA between 4.0 and 5.4 kilobases (kb) in length was necessary for urease activity and was located within an 18.5-kb EcoRI fragment. The operon was induced by urea and encoded a multimeric, cytoplasmic enzyme comprising subunit polypeptides of 8,000, 10,000, and 73,000 daltons that were encoded by a single polycistronic mRNA and transcribed in that order. Seventeen urease-negative transposon insertions were isolated that synthesized either none of the structural subunit polypeptides, the 8,000-dalton polypeptide alone, or both the 8,000- and 10,000-dalton subunit polypeptides. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 212,000 by Superose-6 chromatography. Homologous sequences encoding the urease of Providencia stuartii synthesized subunit polypeptides of similar sizes and showed a similar genetic arrangement. However, restriction maps of the operons from the two species were distinct, indicating significant divergence.
TI  - Production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-76,252 (CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - U-76,252 is the prodrug of U-76,253. MICs of U-76,253 were 0.015 to 0.06 microgram/ml for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis; 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml for Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter diversus; 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus spp.; and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila; for 72% of the latter group, MICs were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were greater than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Suitability of a propanolic PVP-iodophor preparation as preoperative skin disinfectant: germicidal activity and chemical stability.
AB  - The preparation Solutio Betadini propanolica 3% w/w, used as a pre-operative skin disinfectant was examined for its germicidal activity and its chemical stability. The additive activity of iodine and propanol resulted in a wide range of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, including bacterial spores, and fungi, with a rapid onset and sustained duration of action. The solution is easily manufactured and analyzed, its stability is guaranteed for 6 months. Because of its staining property, there is no need of coloured additives to mark the disinfected area. In addition, no skin irritations by the disinfectant were observed so far. Thus, the preparation fulfills the essential requirements for preoperative skin disinfectants and is suitable for the preparation and the compounding in hospital pharmacies.
TI  - The production of anorexigenic substances by intestinal flora.
AB  - The role of intestinal flora in the production of anorexigenic substance was investigated. Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were found to produce an anorexigenic substance, while Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis, type 1 and 2) and Staphylococcus intermedius (S. intermedius) did not. The anorexigenic substance was purified and was detected as, a single though broad band by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The specific activity of the final form of the purified substance was 120 units/mg carbohydrate. The substance contained no protein residue and appeared to be a lipopolysaccharide. The evidence that intestinal flora produces an anorexigenic substance leads to an interesting assumption that the intestinal flora may be responsible for regulating food intake.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological evaluation of cefmenoxime in the newborn infant].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) has been administered under parenteral injection to 39 neonates delivered at term, nearly always by monotherapy in an average dosage of 86.8 mg/kg/day. CMX has been used 31 times in first line therapy and 8 times after failure of association Ampicillin-Gentamicin. 25 strains have been identified: 16 E. coli (9 Ampicillin resistant), 7 P. mirabilis (1 Ampicillin resistant), 1 K. oxytoca and 1 Streptococcus B. The neonates group with septicaemia (1 with arthritis) has been cured without after-effects as urinary tract infections and systemic infections. 2 respiratory tract infections have been improved, the others have been cured. Bacterial samples have always been sterilized within 2 days. Local tolerance (IV or/and IM injection) has been very good. No clinical or biological abnormality has been imputed to treatment. Cefmenoxime appears very effective on enterobacteriaceae (MIC range 0.05-0.5 mg/l) and can be used in newborn infections.
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of cefotetan once daily and cefoxitin thrice daily for the treatment of infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
AB  - To compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. Most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and lower extremities caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. The mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. A successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. Of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the patients. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. The incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. Discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. A once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against clinical isolates in pediatrics].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of gentamicin (GM), along with activities of other aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, was studied against clinical isolates collected from pediatric patients during a period of May 1986-April 1987. 1. GM-resistance was noted in 22% of Staphylococcus aureus, 6% of Proteus vulgaris, 8% of Morganella morganii, 40% of Providencia spp., 6% of Enterobacter spp., 14% of Serratia marcescens, and 14% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. No GM-resistance was observed with isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. 2. The antibacterial activity of GM against clinical isolates from pediatric patients was found to be comparable to its activity against clinical isolates from adults studied at the same time. 3. The majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were MCRSA, and the GM-resistant strains of S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found also to be resistant to multiple drugs. 4. GM-resistant strains were found at relatively high rates (14-22%) in S. aureus, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. These rates did not increase compared to the rates observed in the first half of the 1980's. 5. GM was considered to have poor antibacterial activity against genus Providencia. It is concluded from above results that GM still maintains effective antibacterial activity against many of causative organisms of infections in both adults and children.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acid, compared with those of other quinolones.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Yersinia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. Lomefloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but MICs for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 9 mM Mg2+, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. Lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.
TI  - [Evolution from 1976 to 1986 of bacterial prevalence and sensitivity to urinary antibiotics of bacteria isolated from urine cultures at a city microbiology laboratory].
AB  - The evolution of the prevalence of the bacterial strains isolated from UTI cases  (bacteriuria greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml has been studied over a 11 year-period from 1976 to 1986, in a clinical practice microbiological laboratory from a rural area. E. coli was the overall most frequently isolated species, followed by P. mirabilis (74.4% and 11.2% respectively), by the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group (4.8%), and staphylococci (represented by coagulase negative staphylococci) (4.9%). The relative frequency of the different species has been relatively stable year after year during the considered period. The evolution of the resistance to 4 antibiotics has been studied species by species and year after year for the Gram negative bacilli: a definite evolution towards resistance has been noted for ampicillin until 1985, followed by a decrease in 1986. The same tendency, although less pronounced, has been noted for cotrimoxazole. The frequency of the resistance to nalidixic acid has slightly increased from 1976 to 1986 (1.9% to 6.5%), as well as to pipemidic acid from (0% to 4%). The quinolones stand in 1987 as a good first line treatment of UTI in community, and especially in rural areas, and the role of the clinical practice microbiological laboratory for the epidemiological surveillance has to be stressed.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - [Current status of aminoglycoside resistance in hospital Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - We studied the susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae to four aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin et amikacin). We determined their phenotypes of resistance by taking into account both the critic concentrations of the CFA (french committee for antibiogram) and the MIC of the main susceptible population of each species. The most frequent phenotypes were GTNt, TNtA and GTNtA. Amikacin resistance including phenotypes were essentially found in Klebsiella and Serratia (35% and 53% of the strains, respectively); with respect to amikacin, the phenotype expression may be insufficient to exceed the sensitive critic concentration of the CFA. Amikacin resistant strains were isolated from chronically infected patients with devices, such as urinary catheters or tracheal cannula. These results suggest a strains or plasmids outbreak.
TI  - New plate medium for screening and presumptive identification of gram-negative urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - A new selective, differential plating medium to screen the common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens is described. The medium combines adonitol fermentation, phenylalanine deaminase, and beta-glucuronidase tests and allows the indole and cytochrome oxidase tests to be performed directly from the plates. High-level agreement with individual conventional tests was recorded in comparative studies with 504 cultures of gram-negative rods. There was 100% agreement, except for the Providencia spp. indole spot test (61.6% agreement). Adonitol fermentation by Providencia species could not be determined. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified with a high efficiency (100, 85.7, 83.5, and 100% agreement, respectively) without further testing. There was 96% overall agreement for the 267 infected urine samples tested.
TI  - Cloning of the recB, recC, and recD genes from Proteus mirabilis in Escherichia coli: in vivo formation of active hybrid enzymes.
AB  - We cloned chromosomal DNA fragments from Proteus mirabilis which complement recBCD deletion mutants of Escherichia coli by restoring (i) recombination proficiency in conjugation, (ii) normal resistance to UV irradiation, and (iii) ATP-dependent exonuclease activity for duplex DNA. The data indicate that the order of the genes thyA, recC, recB, recD, and argA is similar in both P. mirabilis and E. coli. Hybrid enzymes formed in vivo were active in repair and recombination.
TI  - Multiple proteins encoded within the urease gene complex of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA fragments from a uropathogenic isolate of Proteus mirabilis were  inserted into the cosmid vector pHC79 to construct a genomic library in Escherichia coli HB101. A urease-positive recombinant cosmid, designated pSKW1, was recovered. Sequential recombinant manipulation of pSKW1 yielded a 10.2-kilobase plasmid, designated pSKW4, which encoded three urease isozymes with electrophoretic mobilities identical to those of the donor P. mirabilis strain. Plasmid pSKW4 gene sequences encode seven proteins designated 68K (apparent molecular weight, of 68,000), 28K, 25K, 22.5K, 18.5K, 7.5K, and 5.2K within the limits of the urease gene complex. Insertion mutations in genes encoding the 68K, 28K, 25K, 22.5K, 7.5K, and 5.2K proteins resulted in complete or partial (22.5K) loss of urease activity. There was no reduction in urease activity when the gene encoding the 18.5K protein was inactivated.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Treatment of experimental cystitis in the rat with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol.
AB  - The therapeutic effectiveness of a single oral dose (60 and 200 mg/kg body weight) of fosfomycin trometamol (FT), norfloxacin, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) and pipemidic acid against experimental cystitis in the rat were compared. Infections were produced with clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in a total of 135 Sprague-Dawley albino rats. Oral treatment with all four drugs consistently lowered the numbers of CFU in bladder tissue, especially E. coli and P. mirabilis. Fosfomycin trometamol appeared to be as effective as norfloxacin for treatment of E. coli cystitis even thoughs its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in vitro is 100 times greater than that of the quinolonic antibiotic. Fosfomycin trometamol, pipemidic acid and Bactrim were equally effective against P. mirabilis infection, but FT was less active than norfloxacin or Bactrim for treatment of K. pneumonia cystitis. In conclusion, single dose treatment with fosfomycin trometamol was effective for treatment of experimental cystitis in the rat and might, by extrapolation, be of use in clinical practice for single dose treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in human urine of fosfomycin trometamol in an in vitro model of the urinary bladder.
AB  - The urinary concentrations of fosfomycin trometamol, norfloxacin, pipemidic acid  and cotrimoxazole were studied at various times after oral administration of drugs in healthy volunteers. Using the same urine, the bactericidal activity of four antimicrobial agents against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in an in vitro model simulating the treatment of bacterial cystitis was also evaluated. The results obtained show that very high concentrations of the drugs were achieved in urine particularly after the oral administration of the fosfomycin trometamol. In the bladder model bactericidal activity of fosfomycin trometamol, norfloxacin and pipemidic acid were higher than that of cotrimoxazole; no resistant mutants to drugs were selected over a period of 24 h.
TI  - Role of intestinal anaerobic bacteria in colonization resistance.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the intestinal anaerobe bacteria in colonization resistance. Germfree mice were associated with Escherichia coli C25 and either (a) no other species; (b) enterococcus; (c) Escherichia coli M14 and Proteus mirabilis, or (d) Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus. All species colonized the cecum in high numbers, but only enterococcus significantly limited the translocation of Escherichia coli C25 to mesenteric lymph nodes. However, the overall translocation rates were similar in all groups and ranged from 60% to 100%, due to translocation of other intestinal flora in addition to Escherichia coli C25. Conventionally reared mice were given either streptomycin, bacitracin/streptomycin or metronidazole which selectively eliminated facultative gram-negative bacteria, nearly all bacterial species or strictly anaerobic bacteria respectively. Only metronidazole significantly increased the rates of translocation of normal intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes. Cohort groups of mice were then orally inoculated with drug resistant Escherichia coli C25, which actively colonized the cecum of all drug treated mice and translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of approximately half the streptomycin and metronidazole treated mice and nearly all the bacitracin/streptomycin treated mice. These results indicate that anaerobic bacteria play a pivotal role in limiting the translocation of normal intestinal bacteria, but that other bacterial groups also have a role in preventing the intestinal colonization and translocation of potential pathogens.
TI  - Activity of cefotaxime and amikacin against 14,272 gram-negative bacteria from clinical samples in the period 1980 to 1985.
AB  - The sensitivity to cefotaxime and amikacin of 14,272 Gram-negative bacilli (Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli) isolated from clinical samples was studied during the period 1980 to 1985. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by means of diffusion in agar. Strains were considered resistant to cefotaxime and amikacin if the MIC values were greater than 16 mg/L and greater than 8 mg/L, respectively. The MIC90 reached the critical value for cefotaxime in the case of Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., and for amikacin in the case of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella spp. and Serratia spp. Only Shigella spp. were sensitive to cefotaxime but not to amikacin, and only strains of Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. were sensitive to amikacin but not to cefotaxime.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli to cefotaxime, over a period of 3 years.
AB  
TI  - Is pelvic inflammatory disease an indication for treatment with ciprofloxacin?
AB  - This pilot study was carried out on 23 gynaecological patients suffering from salpingitis, salpingitis and pelviperitonitis, Douglas' abscess, and vaginal stump abscess. 21 courses were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The diagnoses had been established mainly by pelviscopy and by clinical gynaecological examinations. The dosage was 2 X 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h for 7.6 (5-11) days. Cervical smears collected before therapy revealed the most common pathogens to be Escherichia coli and staphylococci, followed by Proteus mirabilis and streptococci. Clinically ciprofloxacin produced a complete cure in 16 patients (76%), and a clear improvement in four patients (19%). One patient left hospital before completing the therapy. Laboratory tests did not reveal any pathological findings, and ophthalmological examinations (fundoscopy, visus, colour perception) on 16 patients, before and after treatment, likewise did not show any changes. In one patient, therapy had to be discontinued after three days because of pruritic exanthema and vertigo. A second patient complained of strong pain behind the eyes and headache. In both patients these symptoms disappeared completely on discontinuation of treatment. The study showed clinical efficacy of orally administered ciprofloxacin in pelvic inflammatory disease.
TI  - Production and properties of haemolysins from clinical isolates of the Proteeae.
AB  - A collection of 198 clinical isolates of strains belonging to the tribe Proteeae  was examined for haemolytic activity on blood agar and in Brain Heart Infusion Broth. The strains were of diverse bacteriocin and O-antigenic types and from a wide variety of sources. They included representatives of all species of Morganella, Proteus and Providencia. Approximately half of the M. morgani strains were haemolytic on blood agar. This activity was not associated with any particular bacteriocin type. The haemolysin was also produced during exponential growth in broth and was thermolabile and calcium dependent. All P. mirabilis strains and some P. vulgaris strains were non-haemolytic on blood agar. However, most strains of the Proteus spp., irrespective of their bacteriocin and antigenic type, produced, over a short period during exponential growth in broth, a heat-stable, cell-associated calcium-independent haemolysin. A smaller proportion of P. vulgaris and P. penneri strains produced, in addition, a thermolabile, calcium-dependent haemolysin which was associated with the formation of large haemolytic zones on blood agar. The relationship of these haemolysins to Escherichia coli haemolysin and their possible role in virulence is discussed. Haemolysin production was not found in any of the 74 strains of four species of Providencia.
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Isolation of enterobacteria from diarrhoeic West African dwarf goats.
AB  - An investigation was undertaken to determine Enterobacteriaceae from faecal swabs of West African dwarf goats suffering from diarrhoea in the Nsukka area of Anambra State, Nigeria. In one academic year a total of 37 enteric bacteria were successfully recovered aseptically from 35 faecal swabs from caprine species. The predominant enterobacteria pathogens isolated from diarrhoeic goats and their relative percentage frequency of isolation were: 27 Escherichia (73%), 7 Proteus (19%) and 3 Shigella (8%). Of the total isolates 73% were Escherichia coli, 13% were Proteus morgani, 3% Proteus mirabilis, 3% Proteus vulgaris and 8% Shigella sonnei. Further work is required to elucidate the precise aetiologic role of these organisms in the pathogenesis of caprine diarrhoea in West African dwarf goats.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing of broad-spectrum antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing were performed with blood culture isolates  from 80 patients with septicemia. Ten isolates each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. The isolates were tested against netilmicin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, alone and in different combinations. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas netilmicin was the most active agent against P. aeruginosa and staphylococci. The most active antibiotic combinations were netilmicin-cefotaxime and netilmicin-piperacillin, where a synergistic activity was observed in 68 and 61%, respectively. The highest synergistic activity was against Enterobacteriaceae, but the netilmicin-cefotaxime combination also acted synergistically against more than half of the S. aureus isolates. A relatively low synergistic activity was noted against P. aeruginosa. No case of antagonism was observed. Subinhibitory concentrations of netilmicin, in combination with a greater than or equal to MIC concentration of one of the tested beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly improved the killing of the isolates. Netilmicin exerted a more rapid and pronounced bacterial reduction than the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Antibacterial activity after a single-dose of norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pipemidic acid detected in urine of volunteers.
AB  - Six healthy volunteers received in a triple-crossover design a single oral dose of norfloxacin, ofloxacin or pipemidic acid. Urine samples were collected during the 24 h following the administration and were tested for inhibitory and bactericidal activity against selected strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Norfloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited the urinary growth of sensitive strains during the 24 h of sampling time at dilutions much higher than those generally considered satisfactory. Nalidixic acid was less effective and did not achieve bactericidal activity against Ps. aeruginosa over the interval of 12 to 24 h.

TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime alone and in combination against 320 gram-negative clinical isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime and its intermediate metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime, against 320 Gram-negative bacterial strains was analysed to investigate whether combination of the 2 substances led to increased bactericidal activity. The in vitro study of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed the combination to be more effective against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. and Proteus mirabilis, requiring less than or equal to 50% of the concentration of cefotaxime alone to inhibit 90% of strains. For other micro-organisms the MIC90 for the combination was equal to or within 1 dilution of that for cefotaxime alone.
TI  - A regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  - From 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the Netherlands. Each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. The susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml in ISO-Sensitest broth (Oxoid). No significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. There was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. In contrast, there was a general tendency to an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.
TI  - Characterization of multiply resistant Proteus mirabilis isolates in Hungary.
AB  - According to a survey on tendencies of antibiotic resistance in Hungary (1974-1983), the emergence of multiresistant (MR) Proteus mirabilis isolates is a new phenomenon. A total of 60 strains resistant to 11-16 antibiotics were collected from various specimens and geographical locations. Except for cefoperazone, third generation cephalosporins, amikacin, netilmicin and ofloxacin were effective in vitro against multiply resistant P. mirabilis isolates. Out of them 62% belonged to O18, a serogroup not shown in early studies in Hungary; moreover, in serogroup-distribution the present collection differed sharply from isolates examined in 1956. All but two strains produced the same aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme ANT (2"), and all of them proved beta-lactamase positive in nitrocephin test. All multiresistant strains harboured 2-4 plasmids, whereas the sensitive isolates had no plasmids. The presence of two plasmids (62 and 22 Mdal) occurring in 85% of the isolates was a characteristic feature of the multiresistant P. mirabilis isolates. In contrast to these plasmids some other ones (17.5, 103 and 113 Mdal) could be transferred to Escherichia coli recipient. There was no relationship between plasmid profiles, serogroups and resistance patterns.
TI  - The in-vitro assessment of a collagen/vicryl (polyglactin) composite film together with candidate suture materials for potential use in urinary tract surgery. III. Adherence of bacteria to the material surface.
AB  - A Collagen/Vicryl (Polyglactin) composite membrane (developed for use in urinary  tract surgery) has been incubated in cultures of radioactively labelled urinary tract pathogens vis Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis for up to 1 h. For comparison, collagen film, Vicryl mesh, and a number of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures were similarly tested. Following incubation, samples were also examined by scanning electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions employed, only minimal adherence of the micro-organisms to the collagen coated Vicryl mesh, its two individual components, as well as Vicryl and nylon sutures was observed. Significantly greater numbers of bacteria, however, adhered to silk and Chromic Catgut. The results suggest that adherence of microorganisms to the prosthesis even in infected urine is unlikely to develop into a microcolony of bacteria. However, it should be emphasised that great care must be exercised when extrapolating from the in-vitro to the in-vivo situation.
TI  - Variable in vitro activity of cefaclor, cephalothin and cefadroxil against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefaclor, cephalothin and cefadroxil to 50 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 20 Proteus mirabilis strains was tested with the disc diffusion and microdilution plate techniques. Cefaclor was more active than cefadroxil, while cephalothin was intermediate. The differences seriously affected the classification into the routine SIR system. For susceptibility testing we question the use of cephalothin as a class representative of oral cephalosporins.
TI  - The action of LPS porins and peptidoglycan fragments on human spermatozoa.
AB  - This study examines the action of the cell wall components of enterobacteria on the vitality of human spermatozoa. Lipopolysaccharides extracted from Escherichia coli K12 killed about 80% of the spermatozoa at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Porins extracted from E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium killed between 80% and 100% of the spermatozoa at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Muramic acid and N-acetylmuramic acid caused about 60% mortality at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. The possibility that the products of cellular lysis in the course of gram-negative infections cause temporary sterility is discussed.
TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst fluid from autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. To study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with ADPKD receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus fecalis. The mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. Sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. Cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. These studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sisomicin (SISO) against clinical isolates obtained in the second half of 1986 were investigated together with other 4 aminoglycosides (AGs) (gentamicin (GM), tobramycin (TOB), dibekacin (DKB), amikacin (AMK] and 2 cephems (cefotiam, cefotaxime), and were compared to the results reported in the period of late 1970's through early 1980's in Japan. 1. The incidence of SISO-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the present study was 18% and is comparable to that of the other studies suggesting that the incidence of SISO resistant strains remains on the stable level. The incidence of SISO-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the tendency of slight increase. 2. SISO-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii did not show increase from the 1970/1980 levels. 3. Isolation rates of SISO-resistant indole(+) Proteus varied depending on strains. Isolation rates of SISO-resistant P. vulgaris and Morganella morganii were both as low as 4%, but that of Providencia rettgeri was as high as 60%. Refering to an American study reporting that the Genus Providencia including P. rettgeri showed high incidence of resistance to SISO as well as to GM or TOB, we pointed out that the antimicrobial activity of AGs against Genus Providencia should be evaluated separately from those of other indole(+) Proteus strains. 4. No SISO-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or P. mirabilis were found. 5. SISO had good antimicrobial activity against most of the investigated species and SISO may still be regarded as one of the clinically useful AGs.
TI  - R-plasmid RP1 promotes adhesion of gram-negative bacteria to medical prostheses and glass.
AB  - The presence of R-plasmid RP1 increased the adhesion of chemostat-grown iron- and carbon-limited Proteus mirabilis to the surfaces of various medical prostheses and to glass. Similar results were obtained with iron-limited Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobically-grown Escherichia coli. Changes in the surface properties of P. mirabilis indicated that the R-plasmid-mediated increase in negative charge was one of the factors that promoted adhesion.
TI  - Assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  - A simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. The activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with EDTA + Tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. Except for phenoxyethanol against Pv. stuartii and possibly Ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. However, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate Ps. aeruginosa. It is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - Concentration of pefloxacine in split ejaculates of patients with chronic male accessory gland infection.
AB  - The concentrations of pefloxacine and its N-demethylated derivative were measured in split ejaculates of 12 patients with chronic male accessory gland infection during treatment with 400 mg. pefloxacine twice a day. The mean concentrations of pefloxacine and N-demethylated pefloxacine (mg. per l.) were 8.7 +/- 1.2 (standard error of the mean) and 4.2 +/- 0.7 in fraction 1, and 9.8 +/- 1.1 and 4.3 +/- 0.6 in fraction 2. The concentrations in both fractions were correlated strongly (r equals 0.97). The concentration of pefloxacine in the secretory fluids of the prostate and seminal vesicles are 30-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration 90 of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, 100-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration 90 of Proteus mirabilis and equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration 90 of Streptococcus faecalis. In three-fourths of the patients signs of infection resolved after 4 weeks of treatment.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. Comparison with other new cephems].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of CPZ, Cefotiam (CTM), Cefotaxime (CTX) and Latamoxef (LMOX). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of SBT and CPZ mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by the dilution method using Mueller-Hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of CPZ. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/CPZ against principally penicillinase (PCase) producing bacteria, i.e., S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, were superior to those of CPZ alone. The presence of SBT in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced CPZ's antimicrobial activities against these PCase producing strains. The synergistic antimicrobial effects of SBT in combination with CPZ were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (CEPase) producing bacteria, i.e., C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris, and P. aeruginosa, and exerted with SBT at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. Comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by MIC80's of tested agents showed that SBT/CPZ had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria than CTM, CTX and LMOX. MIC's of SBT/CPZ were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of S. aureus, 18% of C. freundii, 10% of Enterobacter spp., 26% of S. marcescens, 2% of P. vulgaris, and 18% of P. aeruginosa. These resistant strains against which the addition of SBT showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. It is concluded that the presence of CPZ resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from CPZ is increasing. When these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of SBT/CPZ in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.
TI  - Endotoxin provocation of experimental renal cystic disease.
AB  - Germ free rats provide a unique model in which to assess biological response to environment. In 48 germ-free male, Sprague-Dawley rats we examined the consequences of oral exposure to nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a nephrotoxin; to Staphylococcus epidermidis and bacillus species, non-endotoxin-containing bacteria; to Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, endotoxin-containing bacteria; and injected E. coli endotoxin on peripheral leukocyte counts and renal morphology. Morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. Means of these renal "pathology scores" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The highest counts and scores were found in rats given NDGA and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. Counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either NDGA or endotoxin. Results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of NDGA as causes of nephropathy. They indicate that endotoxin and NDGA act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free NDGA-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates in a hospital  with long-term use of gentamicin.
AB  - Between 1977 and 1985, gentamicin was the only formulary aminoglycoside at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Medical Center. During this time, there was a significant increase in the amount of gentamicin purchased. Amikacin represented 11% or less of the total aminoglycoside purchased in the same period, but purchases of this agent also significantly increased. Because of this long-term use of gentamicin, a retrospective analysis of gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates was performed. The results of this review revealed no significant change in the overall incidence of gram-negative bacteremia; approximately 75% of these bacteremic episodes were hospital acquired. The mean yearly gentamicin-resistance rate of gram-negative blood isolates was 13.2% (range, 6% to 18%) with no significant change in the rate for the period reviewed. However, for certain strains there were fluctuations in the percentage of resistance from year to year, suggesting that clusters of infections due to these organisms had occurred. Bacteremic infection due to resistant organisms was a major contributor to the overall level of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates. Amikacin resistance among gram-negative blood isolates was rare. In conclusion, despite the predominant use of gentamicin there was no change in the gentamicin resistance rate among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates during a nine-year period. The rate of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates appeared to be related to outbreaks/clusters of infections due to resistant strains rather than the frequency of use of gentamicin.
TI  - Cephalosporin, carbapenem, and monobactam antibiotics.
AB  - Cephalosporin and related antibiotics are highly effective bactericidal agents of relatively low toxicity. The spectrum of activity varies with the drug but is usually broad. The first-generation cephalosporins, and especially cefazolin, are most active against sensitive staphylococci and streptococci. Most second-generation (except cefoxitin) and third-generation cephalosporins show substantial activity against Haemophilus influenzae. All cephalosporins (except cefsulodin) are active against Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, whereas only the third-generation agents have pronounced activity against the other Enterobacteriaceae. Imipenem (a carbapenem) is active against essentially all pathogenic organisms, but aztreonam (a monobactam) is active against only aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Advantages associated with some of the new cephalosporins are once-daily administration and high cerebrospinal fluid levels. With the development of new cephalosporins, however, new toxicities have become apparent, and superinfections and induction of resistance have become greater problems. The cephalosporins are among the most expensive antibiotics in use today; thus, use of these expensive agents must be justified by lower toxicity, greater efficacy, or both in comparison with drugs of more reasonable cost.
TI  - The penicillins.
AB  - The penicillin family of antibiotics is ever expanding and remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. These medications generally have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections due to susceptible organisms. The clinical introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococci prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, and others), in which the acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. The aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and others) were later developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella, Salmonella, Listeria, and Haemophilus. The search for a penicillin with even further antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins, ureidopenicillins, and piperazine penicillins. Recently, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an amino-penicillin or ticarcillin has resulted in further extension of their antibacterial spectra. The development of an ideal penicillin that is nonsensitizing, bioavailable, beta-lactamase-resistant, rapidly bactericidal, nontoxic, and inexpensive and that has high affinity to penicillin-binding proteins and no inoculum effect remains the goal.
TI  - Identification of two different hemolysin determinants in uropathogenic Proteus isolates.
AB  - DNA sequences similar to those of the Escherichia coli hemolysin genes were detected among uropathogenic isolates of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii by using the Southern blotting technique and hly gene-specific DNA probe. Immunoblotting revealed that among the hemolytic P. vulgaris and M. morganii isolates there was expressed a polypeptide species similar in molecular size (110 kilodaltons) and antigenicity to Escherichia coli HlyA. A plasmid-mediated P. vulgaris hemolysin determinant identified by Southern blotting analysis was molecularly cloned, and the recombinant plasmid (pWPV100) was characterized by restriction endonuclease fragment mapping. A second recombinant library of genomic DNA prepared from a hemolytic, urinary tract isolate of Proteus mirabilis was constructed in E. coli. A 5.5-kilobase XhoI fragment encoding an extracellular hemolytic activity was molecularly cloned (pWPM100), and this plasmid was subjected to transposon-mediated mutagenesis with TnphoA. The P. mirabilis hemolytic phenotype was determined to be encoded by a polypeptide species (HpmA) with an estimated molecular size of 140 kilodaltons based on minicell polypeptide analysis of pWPM100 and its mutant derivatives. Southern blotting analysis with a HpmA-specific DNA probe revealed that this novel determinant is commonly found in both Proteus species but is not present in hemolytic isolates of M. morganii, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to cardiac valve prostheses.
AB  - The adherence of bacterial cells to valvular prostheses has been studied. Bacteria were selected on the basis of their surface features (fimbriae, hydrophobicity and specific receptors). It was found that only strains having fimbriae and high cell surface hydrophobicity adhered to bioprostheses, while they did not adhere to metallic prostheses to any significant extent. Adherence to bioprostheses depended on the exposure time and it was affected by the saline concentration of the suspension medium. Furthermore, different bacterial binding capacity was observed for bioprostheses from different companies.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - A new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. BMY-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. BMY-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more active than cephalexin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to BMY-28100 and cefaclor. The bactericidal activity of BMY-28100 against S. aureus, E. coli and P. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as MIC value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. The stability of BMY-28100 against penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. BMY-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three Gram-positive bacterial infections. BMY-28100 was also more potent against infections of H. influenzae and P. mirabilis, but slightly less active against E. coli Juhl than cefaclor. Blood level parameters of BMY-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. The urinary recovery of BMY-28100 was somewhat higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees C.
TI  - The action of sodium deoxycholate on Escherichia coli.
AB  - Sodium deoxycholate is used in a number of bacteriological media for the isolation and classification of gram-negative bacteria from food and the environment. Initial experiments to study the effect of deoxycholate on the growth parameters of Escherichia coli showed an increase in the lag time constant and generation time and a decrease in the growth rate constant and total cell yield of this microorganism. Cell fractionation studies indicated that sodium deoxycholate at levels used in bacteriological media interferes with the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into the cold-trichloroacetic acid-soluble, ethanol-soluble, and trypsin-soluble cellular fractions of E. coli. Finally, sodium deoxycholate interfered with the flagellation and motility of Proteus mirabilis and E. coli. It would appear then that further improvement of the deoxycholate medium may be in order.
TI  - Urinary lithiasis in the black population: an epidemiological study and review of the literature.
AB  - A retrospective review of 199 black patients with urinary calculi and review of the census figures of the index hospitals revealed that white patients had urinary calculi 3 to 4 times as often as black subjects. The black male-to-female ratio was 1 to 1.55 compared to a ratio for white patients of 2.3 to 1. Calculi in black male subjects occur at a younger age than in black or white female or white male patients. The most common organisms cultured in black patients with stones were Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast to the white population the most common type of stone formed in black patients was struvite/carbonate apatite. Stones of this type accounted for a third of all stones in male and 44 per cent in female subjects. We conclude that nephrolithiasis is an uncommon but not rare disease in the American black population.
TI  - Susceptibility of gentamicin sensitive and resistant gram negative bacilli to ceftazidime.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with other third-generation cephalosporins and gentamicin against 409 isolates. Ceftazidime was the most active agent against Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp., Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was less active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than moxalactam and cefotaxime but more active than cefoperazone. Against gentamicin resistant E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime was more active than moxalactam, cefotaxime or cefoperazone but was as active as moxalactam against gentamicin-resistant Proteus sp. and more active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
TI  - The resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  - Isolates of Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with Escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. All species survived the antiseptic. Organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. The effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. Examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. We conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.
TI  - In vitro studies of synergistic interaction between aztreonam and cefoperazone.
AB  
TI  - Characterization of fimbrial subunits from Bordetella species.
AB  - Using antisera raised against serotype 2 and 3 fimbrial subunits from Bordetella  pertussis, serologically related polypeptides were detected in Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella avium strains. The two B. pertussis fimbrial subunits, and three of the serologically related B. bronchiseptica polypeptides, were shown to be very similar in amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Homology was observed between the N-termini of these polypeptides, and fimbrial subunits from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis. A synthetic oligonucleotide probe, derived from the N-terminal sequence of the B. pertussis serotype 2 fimbrial subunit, was used to identify fimbrial genes in genomic Southern blots. The results suggested the presence of multiple fimbrial subunit genes in B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis. The DNA probe was used to clone one of the three tentative fimbrial subunit genes detected in B. pertussis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefadroxil, and the interpretation of disc-susceptibility testing.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a London teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of Gram-negative bacilli. Assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of Gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. No significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. Ninety-five and a half per cent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), Proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) all Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. Of 41 strains of Enterobacter spp., were resistant. Most indole-positive Proteus, and all Serratia and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. Of 30 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, only six had MICs of 16 mg/l or less. For disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm for organisms with MICs of less than 16 mg/l. A zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to MICs of greater than 64 mg/l. Despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin in hospital practice in the U.K.
TI  - Chronic urinary tract infection in dogs: induction by inoculation with bacteria via percutaneous nephropyelostomy.
AB  - Dogs were inoculated via percutaneous nephropyelostomy with bacteria isolated from canine patients with urinary tract infections (4 dogs were inoculated with Escherichia coli, 2 were inoculated with Proteus mirabilis, and 1 was inoculated with coagulase-positive staphylococci). At approximately monthly intervals after bacterial inoculation, bladder urine specimens were collected via antepubic cystocentesis, and renal pelvic urine specimens were collected via percutaneous nephropyelocentesis. Dogs were euthanatized between 89 and 294 days after bacterial inoculation. Extensive microscopic examination was conducted on the urinary tract of each dog. The dogs did not develop any of the common clinical signs of urinary tract infections (ie, increased frequency of urination, fever, craniodorsal abdominal [renal] pain, or malaise). Inflammation in the lower urinary tract of the dogs was more severe than that in the kidneys. Although pyelitis was present, extension into the outer medulla and renal cortex seemed to be confined to nephropyelostomy tracts. The most severe bladder lesion was found in the dog that developed cystic calculi after inoculation with coagulase-positive staphylococci.
TI  - [Study of the sensitivity to pipemidic acid, pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 444 bacterial strains isolated at a general hospital].
AB  - After one year of use of pefloxacin in the intensive care unit, medicine unit and surgery unit and the following recent commercialization without prescription of norfloxacin, we studied for a period of two months (april and may 1986) the susceptibility to pipemidic acid, to pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 444 bacteria strains isolated obtained from clinical specimens. The antibiotic susceptibility is determined by disk diffusion test. We obtained the following results: susceptible methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (SMSA 63 strains): 85.7% PEFS, 11.1% PEFI, 79.4% NORS, 15.9% NORI, resistant methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (RMSA 36 strains): 33.3% PEFS, 2.9% PEFI, 41.6% NORS, 0% NORI; Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (252 strains): 94% PIPS, 94.8% PEFS, 97.2% NORS; Enterobacter, Proteus indol (+), Providencia and Citrobacter (33 strains): 72.7% PIPS, 72.7% PEFS, 84.8% NORS; Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53 strains): 32% PEFS, 47.2% PEFI, 90.6% NORS, 5.6% NORI; Acinetobacter (7 strains): 57.2% PEFS, 42.8% PEFI, 42.8% NORS, 28.6% NORI. Norfloxacin in active in vitro against the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolated. We found an important methicillin and pefloxacin resistance among the Staphylococcus aureus isolated: 36 strains RMSA (36.4% out of Staphylococcus aureus) and 23 strains RMSA PEFR (63.8% out of RMSA). These later strains were isolated in eight different units mainly in visceral surgery unit and geriatric units but not in intensive care unit. After an epidemiologic study and the following recommendations to physicians and nurses: treatment by pefloxacin should be used only after bacteriological results and associated with an other antibiotic, the handwashing should be frequent and regular to prevent the spread of infection, four months later we isolated 26 strains of RMSA with 7 RMSA PEF (26.9%).2$
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.
TI  - Use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. The 31 males and 23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). Patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15), abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). Thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), Acinetobacter species (10 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), Escherichia coli (two isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Kingella kingae (one isolate), Bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. In 39 patients, the isolated microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. In 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. The duration of parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). A successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. Bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients (3.7 percent). Side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). Parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy for gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
AB  - The efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin, an orally administered fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in 24 infections in 23 patients with osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and the results of bone biopsy and culture of bone or deep soft tissue. The aerobic gram-negative bacilli were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), Serratia marcescens (five isolates), Escherichia coli (three isolates), Enterobacter species (three isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 1.56 micrograms/ml or less for all but one isolate. Nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. Peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the MBCs in 20 of 24 patients. Twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. A sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks of therapy with a newly resistant S. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive P. aeruginosa strain. Toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). Two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. Overall, ciprofloxacin is a promising agent for the oral treatment of gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
TI  - Comparative, double-blind study of oral ciprofloxacin and intravenous cefotaxime  in skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - The effectiveness and safety of orally administered ciprofloxacin and intravenously administered cefotaxime were compared in a double-blind study of 60 men with infections of skin and soft tissue, including cellulitis, ulcers, abscesses, cellulitis with ulcers or abscesses, wound infections, and post-traumatic infections. Patients in the ciprofloxacin group received 750 mg orally every 12 hours for a mean duration of 9.6 days (six to 18 days), and those in the cefotaxime group received 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours for a mean duration of 9.3 days (five to 14 days). Infection was documented bacteriologically in 78 percent of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and in 83 percent of the patients in the cefotaxime group. Pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species. Half of the infections were mixed infections. Ninety percent (19 of 21) of the infections were bacteriologically eradicated with ciprofloxacin, and 82 percent (18 of 22) were eradicated with cefotaxime. Treatment was completely successful in 79 percent (22 of 28) of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and in 68 percent (19 of 28) in the cefotaxime group (p greater than 0.1). The side effects in both treatment groups were comparable. This study demonstrates that orally administered ciprofloxacin is comparable in effectiveness and safety to cefotaxime administered intravenously in the treatment of infections of skin and soft tissue, and that it can offer an alternative in the treatment of such infections.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzoname in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzoname (CZON) one of the aminothiazolyloxyiminoacetamido cephalosporins, was  studied for its antibacterial activity, absorption and excretion, concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the penetration, and clinical efficacy. The following are a summary of the results: 1. Antibacterial activity; The antibacterial activity of CZON was studied on clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus (cefazolin (CEZ)-susceptible and CEZ-tolerant strains), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis. Compared with CZON were cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone, cefmetazol (CMZ), cefotiam and CEZ, but for S. aureus cefamandole (CMD) was replaced for CPZ. Activities of CZON against S. aureus, both CEZ-susceptible and CEZ-tolerant strains, were superior to those of 6 control drugs. The distribution of MICs for the CEZ-susceptible strains was 0.10-12.5 micrograms/ml, and for the CEZ-tolerant strains 0.20-greater than 100 micrograms/ml. MIC peaks were 0.39 micrograms/ml and 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml for CEZ-susceptible and CEZ-tolerant strains, respectively. Against both susceptible and tolerant strains, CZON showed superiority to CMZ and CMD, which are used prevalently and used for Methicillin-resistant S. aureus also. Distributions of MICs of CZON (and the peak of MICs) on E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were less than or equal to 0.025-1.56 (less than or equal to 0.025), less than or equal to 0.025-25 (less than or equal to 0.025-0.05), less than or equal to 0.025-25 (less than or equal to 0.025) micrograms/ml, respectively, showing CZON's similar antibacterial activity to those of cephalosporins, CMX and LMOX, which are 5th group. 2. Absorption and excretion: Eight patients, aged 10 months to 15 years, were administered with CZON 20 mg/kg, one shot intravenously. Serum concentrations somewhat varied from patient to patient, but the mean value was 48.7 micrograms/ml after 30 minutes of administration which decreased rapidly to 13.3 micrograms/ml after 1 hour, to 3.4 micrograms/ml after 2 hours, to 1.14 micrograms/ml after 4 hours, and to 0.15 microgram/ml after 6 hours. Half-lives were 0.67-1.47 hours, with the mean of 0.87 hour. Urinary recovery rates were 24.7-55.9%, with the mean of 45.1%, in 6 hours after administration. 3. CSF concentration and penetration rate: To 4 pediatric patients with purulent meningitis, CZON 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg was administered and the concentration in CSF was measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Distribution of cefodizime to exudate in the croton oil-induced rat granuloma pouch and its therapeutic effects on experimental infections in the pouch.
AB  - Cefodizime was compared with cefotaxime (CTX) in regard to its distribution to an inflammatory site (exudate in croton oil-induced granuloma pouch) of rats and its therapeutic effects on experimental infections in such pouches after intravenous injection. Cefodizime levels in rat serum and pouch exudate were higher than those of CTX, and the former compound disappeared from the serum and pouch exudate far more slowly than the latter. In the tests for therapeutic effects, cefodizime showed almost the same degree of inhibitory activity as CTX against growth in pouch exudate of Escherichia coli Ec-7, Proteus mirabilis Pm-428, and Serratia marcescens Sm-390 for which the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefodizime were equal to or greater than the CTX values, and such activity of cefodizime lasted for a longer period than that of CTX. These results suggest that the above pharmacokinetic features of cefodizime compensate for its MICs against organisms displaying lower values for CTX.
TI  - Adherence of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to human transitional cells.
AB  - This study utilizes a light microscopy assay for bacterial adherence to human male transitional cells. Prior light microscopy studies have used voided squamous cells, periurethral cells or scraped vaginal cells, which are less representative of the cells lining the majority of the urinary tract. Using a modification of previous bacterial adherence assays, the mean adherence for 28 strains of E. coli in 92 bacteria-cell incubations was 10.2 +/- 11.5 (standard deviation) bacteria per cell. The mean adherence for 20 strains of P. mirabilis in 60 bacteria cell incubations was 8.1 +/- 11.4. No statistically significant difference in adherence between E. coli and P. mirabilis was found (p greater than 0.05). Studies comparing the adherence of E. coli isolated from the urine of patients with pyelonephritis (eight strains), cystitis (10 strains) and anal swabs of females without urinary tract infections (10 strains), showed no statistically significant differences in mean adherence (p greater than 0.05). However, there was a trend toward higher adherence in the more virulent groups. Experiments comparing the adherence of P. mirabilis isolated from infected renal stones to P. mirabilis isolated from anal swabs of female patients without history of P. mirabilis UTI revealed no statistically significant differences in mean adherence between the two groups (p greater than 0.05). These data do not support previous contentions that P. mirabilis adhere poorly to human transitional cells. The absence of a significant difference in adherence among strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis that differ in clinical pathogenicity suggests that factors other than adherence contribute to their virulence.
TI  - The secreted hemolysins of Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii are genetically related to each other and to the alpha-hemolysin of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Secreted hemolysins were extremely common among clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, and hemolytic activity was either cell associated or cell free. Southern hybridization of total DNA from hemolytic isolates to cloned regions of the Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin (hly) determinant showed clear but incomplete homology between genes encoding production of hemolysins in the four species. One of the two E. coli secretion genes, hlyD, hybridized only with DNA from P. vulgaris and M. morganii, which produced cell-free hemolysis, but not with that from P. mirabilis, which showed only cell-associated activity. Molecular cloning of the genetic determinants of cell-free hemolytic activity from P. vulgaris and M. morganii chromosomal DNA allowed their functional analysis via inactivation with the transposons Tn1000 and Tn5. Both hemolysin determinants were about 7.5 kilobase pairs and comprised contiguous regions directing regulation, synthesis, and specific secretion out of the cell. Transposon mutations which eliminated secretion of the Proteus and Morganella hemolysins could be complemented specifically by the E. coli hemolysin secretion genes hlyB or hlyD. Alignment of the physically and functionally defined hly determinants from P. vulgaris and M. morganii with that of the E. coli alpha-hemolysin confirmed a close genetic relationship but also indicated extensive evolutionary divergence.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - Studies were carried out on the penetration of cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, into cerebrospinal fluid, and on the clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. The results are summarized as follows: Concentrations of CZON in cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg in cases of furunculosis of the external canal, encephalitis and mumps meningitis were 0.56 micrograms/ml, 1.44 micrograms/ml and 0.33 micrograms/ml, respectively. Concentrations of CZON in cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg in 3 cases of purulent meningitis were 2.80-6.40 micrograms/ml at the acute stage and 0.56-1.45 micrograms/ml even at the recovering stage. Sensitivities of clinically isolated strains to CZON were determined and expressed as MIC. MICs of CZON on Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae were similar to MIC's of cefmenoxime (CMX), and lower than those of cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefatiam (CTM) and Cefazolin (CEZ). The MIC of CZON on Staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of CEZ, CMZ and CTM, and lower than those of CMX and CPZ. Clinical responses of CZON were good in 2 cases of purulent meningitis, good in 2 cases of pyothorax, excellent in 1 case of septicemia, excellent in 3 cases of urinary tract infections, excellent in 7 cases and good in 3 cases out of 10 cases of pneumonia. Clinical responses of other diseases were excellent in 4 cases of bronchitis, good in 1 case of furunculosis of the external canal, excellent in 1 case of tonsillitis. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 2 cases of mild diarrhea out of 24 cases.
TI  - Scanning electron microscopic examinations of renal stones associated with urinary infections.
AB  
TI  - [Comparative, controlled study on an ampicillin suppository (KS-R 1) with an oral form of ampicillin in urinary tract infections].
AB  - Subjects were in-patients with bacterial urinary tract infections, ranging in age 4 months to 11 years 4 months. As a rule, daily dose was either four 125 mg (in potency) suppositories or four 125 mg (in potency) oral form given at 6-hour intervals over a period of 5 days. The number of children subjected to this study was 105. These children were divided into 2 groups (suppository 54; oral form 51) with matched pretreatment background factors. Therapeutic effectiveness rates were 70.4% for the suppository and 66.7% for the oral form, and no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups. Rates of efficacy by severity, presence or absence of underlying and/or complication diseases, daily dose and causative microorganisms did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in time-courses of improvement of clinical signs and symptoms between the 2 groups. Eradication rates for causative microorganisms were 65.9% for the suppository and 62.5% for the oral form. Most frequently isolated causative microorganisms were Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. No significant differences were recognized in the therapeutic effect and usefulness evaluated by physicians in charge. The frequency of side effects did not differ significantly between the suppository group (6 with diarrhea and 1 with anal pain: 12.1%) and the oral form group (5 with diarrhea, 1 with displeasure and 1 with vomiting: 12.7%). Abnormal laboratory findings appeared in 6 cases (2 with eosinophilia, 2 with increased GOT and 2 with increased GPT) in the suppository group and 7 cases (2 with eosinophilia, 2 with thrombocytosis, 2 with increased GOT and 1 with increased GPT) in the oral form group.
TI  - [Etiology of corneal ulcers with special reference to bacterial genesis].
AB  - The authors report on 134 patients (141 eyes) seen between May 1982 and December  1985 with corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. Eight patients (11 eyes) had a facial palsy, 7 (7 eyes) a varicella zoster infection, 1 (2 eyes) a marginal ulcer ("furrow keratitis") associated with collagenosis, 29 (29 eyes) an ulcerative keratitis with endophthalmitis, 1 (2 eyes) a pemphigoid-associated ulcer and 90 (92 eyes) a herpetic infection. Pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated from 20 patients: 10 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (4 coinfections), 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 coinfection), 2 Proteus mirabilis (1 coinfection), 2 Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and beta-hemolyzing streptococci as well as enterococci in one case each, and non-hemolyzing streptococci and alpha-hemolyzing streptococci in two cases each as coinfections. A comparison of the range of bacterial strains of postoperative endophthalmitis and kerato-/conjunctivitis with bacterial corneal ulcers revealed a high percentage of gram-negative organisms in the latter. Laboratory work-up should include microscopy, agar plating and differentiation as well as antibiotic sensitivity testing and modern immunofluorescent direct techniques. Management includes bactericidal topical and systemic antibiotic regimens as well as surgical procedures if necessary, e.g., perforating tectonic and mini-keratoplasty, and conjunctival flapping followed by lamellar keratoplasty.
TI  - In-vitro bacterial killing kinetics of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  - An in-vitro model was developed to study the rates of killing by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combinations of various beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin resistant, logarithmic phase clinical isolates. Killing, defined as a 3 log reduction, was dependent on the organism, the concentration of clavulanic acid and the duration of exposure. For most isolates studied an optimum period of exposure to and concentration of clavulanic acid could be defined. Certain test strains showed optimum response to readily attainable in-vivo concentrations of clavulanic acid while other strains, although sensitive by MIC data showed a poor response. The clinical implications of this are discussed.
TI  - In-vitro anti-microbial susceptibility of clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria to ten antibiotics including phosphomycin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ten antibiotics was determined for  various bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens in a Lagos hospital. The in-vitro activity of penicillin and tetracycline was not very impressive and a similarity was noticed in the resistance patterns of these two antibiotics, while the activity in vitro of the relatively more toxic aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol was high for Gram-negative rods. Ceftazidime demonstrated the highest activity in vitro against all pathogens studied. Cefoxitin, cefuroxime and phosphomycin demonstrated an impressive activity in vitro. Clindamycin was very active against strains of Staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactamase production amongst these strains was studied and the clinical significance of this and their MIC results are discussed.
TI  - Identification of porins in outer membrane of Proteus, Morganella, and Providencia spp. and their role in outer membrane permeation of beta-lactams.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia alcalifaciens, which were once classified into the same genus, Proteus, were studied. Cefoxitin-resistant mutants from these species were isolated, and it was confirmed that the resistance was attributed to the lack of an outer membrane protein, resulting in a significant decrease in the penetration of hydrophilic cephalosporins through the outer membrane. Comparison of the mutant strains with their parental strains in the diffusion rates of six monoanionic cephalosporins, a zwitterionic cephalosporin (cephaloridine), and a divalent anionic cephalosporin (cephalosporin C) suggested that each species had only one kind of porin protein, with molecular weights of 40,000 (Proteus mirabilis) or 37,000 (the other four species) and that the porins formed channels with cation selectivity, except for Proteus vulgaris. Porin proteins were purified from all the bacterial species except Providencia alcalifaciens, and the radius of the pores formed by the purified porins was estimated by the use of the liposome swelling assay. The pore radii were estimated to be approximately 0.59 nm (Proteus mirabilis), 0.63 nm (Proteus vulgaris), 0.58 nm (Providencia rettgeri), and 0.60 nm (M. morganii), similar to the size of the pore radius of Escherichia coli porins.
TI  - Roles of antibody and complement in the bactericidal activity of mouse peritoneal exudate neutrophils.
AB  - The contributions of complement and antibody to phagocytosis and, as a separate process, intracellular killing of Proteus mirabilis, were investigated using mouse peritoneal exudate neutrophils. Phagocytosis of P. mirabilis was promoted by both immune mouse (IMS) and normal mouse (NMS) sera. Opsonization by IMS promoted significantly greater phagocytosis than did NMS, as did NMS compared with heated IMS (HIMS). The ability of NMS to opsonize P. mirabilis for both phagocytosis and phagocytic killing was diminished by chelation with EGTA and abolished by chelation with EDTA. This suggested that fixation of complement by both alternative and classical pathways provided optimal opsonization of this organism in NMS. In order to study intracellular killing as a process separate from phagocytosis, peritoneal exudate cell suspensions were exposed to P. mirabilis, previously incubated with 1% NMS, 1% IMS, 10% HNMS (heated normal mouse serum) or 10% HIMS, followed by centrifugation of the phagocyte-bacteria mixtures on Percoll density gradients. Populations of neutrophils containing viable intracellular bacteria, and relatively free of extracellular bacteria (less than 7% of total) were recovered in washed suspensions of cells fractionated at densities greater than 1.069 g/ml. For P. mirabilis that had been opsonized with 1% NMS before phagocytosis, the continued presence of extracellular serum was necessary for intracellular killing. NMS stimulated significantly greater intracellular killing than did HNMS, which stimulated some intracellular killing compared with the absence of serum, in which no killing occurred. IMS was similar to NMS in its ability to stimulate intracellular killing. EGTA partially blocked the stimulation of intracellular killing by NMS, and EDTA abolished it. These findings suggested that (as for optimal opsonization) complement activated via both alternative and classical pathways was responsible for optimal stimulation of intracellular killing.
TI  - Cloning of genes from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with mini-Mu bacteriophage containing plasmid replicons.
AB  - An in vivo cloning system that uses derivatives of the Escherichia coli bacteriophage Mu with plasmid replicons has been extended to five different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Mu and these mini-Mu replicon elements were introduced into strains of E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus mirabilis by infection, by transformation, or by conjugation with newly constructed broad-host-range plasmids containing insertions of these elements. Lysates from these cells, lysogenic for Mu and mini-Mu elements, were used to infect sensitive recipient strains of E. coli, S. typhimurium, and C. freundii. Drug-resistant transductants had mini-Mu replicon elements with inserts of different DNA sequences. All of the lysogens made could be induced to yield high phage titers, including those coming from strains that were resistant to Mu and Mu derivatives. Clones of 10 particular genes were isolated by their ability to complement specific mutations in the recipient strains, even in the presence of the E. coli K-12 restriction system. Some of the mini-Mu replicon elements used contained lac gene fusing segments and resulted in fusions of the lac operon to control regions in the cloned sequences.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Treatment of urinary tract infections with SolcoUrovac].
AB  - Urinary tract infections are among the most common infections found in women. If  recurrences or reinfections become frequent treatment can be problematic. Immunisation of the patients by vaccinating them against urinary tract pathogens offers a possibility of managing these infections. In clinical trials we tested SolcoUrovac, a new vaccine to counteract bacterial pathogens, with regard to efficacy, frequency of recurrence, and tolerance. 113 of the 118 patients included in this study with bacteriuria (urine culture germ count greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml), had acute cystitis. 47 of these patients had recurring urinary tract infections. Follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months. A urine culture assay was performed during each examination, as well as a relevant bacterial differentiation test and a urine sediment evaluation. Two to six weeks after termination of the vaccination series 72.6% of the patients were largely free from signs and symptoms. The rate of recurrence/reinfection dropped from 2.5 to 0.24 infections for a period of 12 months. After one year, 94 of the patients (80%) were still free from reinfection.
TI  - N-nitrosamine formation in urinary-tract infections.
AB  - Urine samples from 31 patients with urinary-tract infections and from 31 controls were analysed for volatile nitrosamines, N-nitrosamino acids, total N-nitroso compounds as a group, and nitrite/nitrate. The concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine was significantly elevated in urines infected with Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The levels of nitrite, N-nitrosoproline and total N-nitroso compounds, when expressed as the amount per mol creatinine, were also significantly increased in patients with bacteriuria. Several bacterial strains were capable of catalysing nitrosation of morpholine at neutral pH. These results suggest that N-nitroso compounds can be formed in vivo in the infected bladder, which could explain the association between urinary-tract infections and increased risk for bladder cancer.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children. Status in a pediatric hospital and sensitivity of bacterial strains to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid combination].
AB  - Three hundred bacterial strains from positive urine cultures were isolated over a 10 months period in paediatric hospitalized and out-patients. In addition to commonly used antibiotics, each strain was tested for amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin, Beecham) susceptibility. This antibiotic, which is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta lactamases, may be of interest in the treatment of urinary tract infections because of its pharmacokinetics and activity. The antibacterial activity of amoxycillin and Augmentin against Enterobacteriaceae with special reference to Escherichia coli was compared. The resistance phenotype of Enterobacteriaceae to amoxycillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin allows to anticipate the nature of the beta-lactamase produced by a particular strain, and infer the activity of Augmentin. The overall activity of Augmentin should be interpreted taking into account the resistance phenotypes. In our study, Augmentin was active against 90% of E. coli strains, almost all Proteus mirabilis and vulgaris strains but 9 out of 24 Klebsiella strains were resistant. Augmentin had no activity against nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, nor against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. On the other hand, its activity was of interest against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus. Our results confirm the interest of Augmentin as a preferential treatment of urinary tract infections in children.
TI  - A comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
AB  - The effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. Human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. In contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
TI  - Worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in Japan, the United States, Canada, France, Austria, and Hungary. Standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. Susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. Minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. The susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for Escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for Enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.
TI  - Effect of fosfomycin trometamol on bacterial adhesion in comparison with other chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - The effect of fosfomycin trometamol in comparison with that of norfloxacin and co-trimoxazole on the hemagglutination, yeast cell aggregation and adhesive properties of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms was studied. The strains were isolated from the urine of patients with urinary tract infections, or from vaginal swabs. At sublethal concentrations (1/4 and 1/8 of the minimal inhibitory concentration), the ability of the bacteria to adhere to human uroepithelial cells was reduced by any of the 3 drugs assayed. The reduction corresponded to a decrease in the agglutinating activity of the gram-negative bacteria tested, such providing further evidence for the efficacy of the different chemoantibiotics. In particular, fosfomycin trometamol and norfloxacin proved to be more effective than co-trimoxazole in affecting the adhesive properties of all the strains employed.
TI  - Five-year survey of changing patterns of susceptibility of bacterial uropathogens to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We analyzed the antibiotic susceptibility of 5,348 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, "Klebsiella aerogenes," and Proteus mirabilis grown in three laboratories from 1980 to 1985. A continuous rise in resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed; 63% of the strains from inpatients in 1984 and 51% of those from outpatients in 1985 were resistant to this drug. Isolates from outpatients in 1985 were mostly susceptible to nitrofurantoin (mean susceptibility, 92%) and to oral cephalosporins (mean susceptibility, 84%). As for isolates from inpatients, none of the antimicrobial agents now used was satisfactory for initial chemotherapy, indicating a need for new antibacterial strategies.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance at a hospital environment. Observations from 1980 to 1986].
AB  - A total of 1659 bacteria Strains were examined for susceptibility to different drugs by the Kirby-Bauer method. The isolates came from the General Medicine ward of Castellamonte's hospital (USSL 40). The results were retrospectively studied and statistically elaborated. The study lasted from 2 to 7 years depending on the antibiotic considered. The isolates included: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus IND+, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis. Penicillines, Cefalosporines, Aminoglycosides, Quinolones, Tetraciclines, Nitrofurantoin, Macrolides, Rifampins, Lincosides and peptide antibiotics were tested. The results of this study can be useful for the choice of the antibiotics in non-specific therapy of infectious diseases and show the frequency of isolation of resistant strains from hospitalized patients. Furthermore it would be important to constitute a regional-epidemiological centre of Infectious Diseases.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin for pediatric infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - One hundred and four children who were hospitalized for documented or suspected non-CNS bacterial infections (56 males/48 females, 22 days to 15 years old) were treated with intravenous imipenem/cilastatin for 9.4 days (range 3 to 28 days). Children up to three years of age received 100 mg/kg/day and older children 60 mg/kg/day, administered in four divided doses. Bacterial pathogens were isolated before therapy in 85%. Diagnoses in the 74 evaluable patients included bronchopneumonia with or without empyema (20%), peritonitis complicating appendicitis (16%), skin/soft tissue abscesses (14%), septicemia (11%) and miscellaneous other infections (39%). Among evaluable patients, 95% were clinically cured or improved. One patients, a marasmic child with pneumonitis due to pseudomonas, died during therapy. One evaluable patient each with shigellosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae empyema and streptococcal pneumonia had bacteriologic eradication or suppression but, due partly to noninfectious complications, had no overall clinical improvement. Most bacterial isolates (101/108) were eradicated, including many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes; three pathogens persisted (one Proteus mirabilis and one Salmonella typhi, one Staphylococcus aureus); and one Escherichia coli pyelonephritis recurred after therapy ended too early. Imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated by 91% of children. Clinical adverse experiences (AEs), none serious except for the one death, occurred in 19%; 12% were judged possibly related to imipenem/cilastatin, but none probably or definitely related. No serious laboratory AEs occurred; the most common AEs were eosinophilia (11%), urine discoloration, and infusion site pain. Imipenem/cilastatin is well tolerated and has excellent clinical efficacy in a wide variety of pediatric infections.
TI  - Overproduction of gene products by the super-high-copy-number plasmid pNR333.
AB  - The plasmid pNR333 is a kanamycin-resistant, deletion derivative of pNR113 with an extremely high copy number in Escherichia coli and in Proteus mirabilis. In order to determine the usefulness of pNR333 as a replication gene of vector, the genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) and beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) were cloned individually into both pNR333 and other low-copy-number plasmids. The expression of the cloned genes was compared by measuring the specific activity of each enzyme and the amounts of the proteins produced. A hybrid plasmid pNR333-cat expressed 53 times as much activity of CAT as the low-copy plasmid S-a which had a copy number of four. The lacZ gene cloned in pNR333 produced 17 times as much beta-gal as in the low-copy-number plasmid pNR1150. These results suggest that pNR333 is a useful vector plasmid for producing a large amount of polypeptides in E. coli hosts.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris against bacterial isolates from clinical specimens.
AB  - Chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris was more active compared with chlorhexidine against the following species of organisms: Acinetobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Providence species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis, when tested in isosensitest agar. The addition of 20% serum to the medium reduced its effectiveness mainly against Providence species, Proteus species, and Streptococcus faecalis. However, the potential for this solution as a bladder instillation or topical antiseptic should be considered because of its reduced side effects compared with chlorhexidine alone, and its increased general effectiveness against all isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Ro 23-6240 was assessed and compared with  those of ciprofloxacin and beta-lactam antibiotics including several oral compounds against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (n = 130) and Pseudomonas spp. (n = 31). In general, Ro 23-6240 was 2 dilution steps less active than ciprofloxacin. For the Pseudomonas spp. the MICs for 90% inhibition were 2 and 0.5 mg/1 for Ro 23-6240 and ciprofloxacin, respectively. For the other species tested, the MIC90 values for Ro 23-6240 ranged from 0.031 to 1 mg/1 and for ciprofloxacin from 0.016 to 0.25 mg/1. Spontaneous Ro 23-6240-resistant mutants were only isolated from Enterobacter cloacae with a frequency similar to that of ciprofloxacin (4.8 X 10(-8) and 2.4 X 10(-8), respectively). No resistant mutants were isolated from Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 4 and 8 times the MIC of Ro 23-6240 or ciprofloxacin (frequency less than 10(-9).
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - Imipenem as monotherapy in the treatment of intensive care patients with severe infections.
AB  - In an open study, 24 intensive care patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin as monotherapy for serious bacterial infections. Twenty-one patients were treated for bronchopulmonary infection, two patients for septicaemia, and one patient for an empyema. Initially all strains were susceptible to imipenem. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 80% of these isolates. The most frequently isolated species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All 24 patients were considered clinically cured. Sixteen of these patients (67%) were both clinically and microbiologically cured. In eight of the 24 patients (33%), the strains isolated initially persisted. In eight of the 24 patients (33%), colonization of the respiratory tract developed. Two of the five Ps. aeruginosa isolates developed resistance during therapy but in none of these patients was therapy considered to have failed. In 12 patients (50%), transient elevations in hepatic function tests were observed and these were probably drug-related. The present study supports the view that imipenem/cilastatin may be useful as monotherapy in the treatment of severe infections in intensive care patients.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.

TI  - Comparison of cefixime and co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. A double-blind general practice study.
AB  - Five hundred and twenty-eight patients with presumptive acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) were randomly assigned to receive cefixime 400 mg once daily, cefixime 200 mg twice daily or co-trimoxazole 2 tablets twice a day for 10 days; 477 completed at least 5 days of therapy. Of the patients 342 (65%) had positive baseline urine cultures, yielding 353 pathogens. A microbiological response was determined for 280 pathogens (79%), eradication being observed in over 94% of isolates; 153 pathogens (43%) were sensitive to both cefixime and co-trimoxazole and eradication was observed in over 96% of cases. Clinical response correlated well with microbiological response. The incidence of diarrhoea and stool changes was higher (P less than 0.005) in the patients who received cefixime once daily than in the other groups. There was a significantly higher incidence of stool changes with cefixime twice daily than with co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.05), but these did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Nausea was commoner with co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.05). The majority of pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and staphylococci. Approximately 24% of E. coli were resistant in vitro to co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.005). Cefixime 200 mg twice daily is an effective and safe alternative to co-trimoxazole in the management of acute uncomplicated UTI.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics at medical centres in different parts of the world.
AB  - The diameters of the zones of inhibition of consecutive clinical isolates around  antibiotic susceptibility test discs at medical centres in different parts of the world were computer filed and analysed by a series of programs that evaluate test quality and compare results. Percentages of isolates resistant to ampicillin at 18 centres ranged from 16 to 73 for Escherichia coli and from 3 to 56 for Proteus mirabilis. Percentages resistant to chloramphenicol ranged from 2 to 48 for E. coli, from 5 to 52 for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and from 8 to 67 for Serratia marcescens. Gentamicin resistance did not exceed 4% at any of 18 centres and was less than 1 at 14 of them for isolates of E. coli, while K. pneumoniae showed less than 2% resistance at six centres but averaged 22% at another eight. Multi-resistant isolates were ten-fold more frequent at eight centres than at the remaining six. Too few centres were sampled to characterize individual countries except in the United States where resistance seemed generally less prevalent.
TI  - Use of aztreonam in patients suffering from urinary tract infections with contraindications for the use of aminoglycosides.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. Duration of therapy was 2-8 days. Bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: Escherichia coli (60%); Proteus mirabilis (10%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp. (7%); Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas species (3%). At completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. No significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. It is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  - Characterization of a protein from normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Purification of a bactericidal protein (BP) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. Bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. The first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with Matrex-Gel Orange A, was followed by cation-exchange chromatography with Bio-Rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. Only one peak of bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa type I was found after each chromatographic step. Characterization of BP showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified BP was most active against the six strains of P. aeruginosa tested and against Escherichia coli B (a deep rough mutant). Purified BP killed 5 X 10(6) CFU of P. aeruginosa type I per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of BP. BP was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. The amino acid composition of BP is presented.
TI  - Comparative study of some biological activities of porins extracted from various  microorganisms.
AB  - The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains some major proteins, called porins, with particular chemical and physical characteristics which reflect some specialized functions peculiar to the outer membrane. In recent years the biological properties of Salmonella typhimurium SH5014 porins have been the focus of our experimental studies. The aim of the present research was to make a comparative investigation of the biological activities of porins extracted from other microorganisms classified in the Enterobacteriaceae, together with a taxonomically different one, Eikenella corrodens frequently isolated from gum pockets of patients with periodontal disease. Porins from E. coli K12, Proteus mirabilis and Eikenella corrodens were extracted, purified and separated from LPS by means of phenol extraction. The purity of preparation was checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in slabs. We studied the interactions of these proteins with some cellular and humoral systems within the host. Mouse peritoneal macrophages in the presence of these proteins show morphological and functional modifications, depending upon the type of porins and the concentrations used. The ability of porins to interact with the complement system was investigated in vitro. A pool of sera from 20 blood donors served as a source of human complement. The results obtained with porins of various sources were shown comparatively.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a uroepithelial cell adhesin from a uropathogenic isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis is a frequent cause of urinary tract infections in rehabilitation hospitals and among persons with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. Adherence to uroepithelial tissues may be an important virulence determinant in these infections because most Proteus strains adhere to desquamated uroepithelial cells. To identify the adherence factor responsible for this phenomenon, we sheared outer membrane material from 35SO4-radiolabeled bacteria and allowed it to bind to uroepithelial cells. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the major adherence element was a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 17,500 and was provisionally designated as the uroepithelial cell adhesin. This adhesin was purified by heat shock and gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B. After purification, the adhesin was seen assembled as long, flexible rods by electron microscopy. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the subunit had limited homology with that of the K99 fimbriae of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Effect of radiation dose on the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from mice.
AB  - The presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the blood, spleen, and liver was investigated in mice that were exposed to 7, 8, 9, or 10 Gy 60Co radiation. Microorganisms were detected more often in animals exposed to higher doses of radiation. The number of mice that were culture positive and the number of isolates in one site increased with increasing dose. Bacteria were recovered in mice killed at various times after radiation, in 3 of 100 mice exposed to 7 Gy, in 13 of 100 irradiated with 8 Gy, in 23 of 90 exposed to 9 Gy, and in 34 of 87 irradiated with 10 Gy. The predominant organisms recovered were Escherichia coli, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides spp. Escherichia coli and anaerobes were more often isolated in animals exposed to 10 Gy, while S. aureus was more often recovered in those irradiated with 9 Gy. These data demonstrate a relationship between the dose of radiation and the rate of infection due to enteric aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies of cefotiam in neonates and premature infants].
AB  - The effect of cefotiam (CTM) on neonates and premature infants was examined in basic and clinical studies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CTM against 190 clinically isolated strains kept by this department were investigated. This drug was found to have a strong antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, although some strains were resistant. The CTM was given to 0-3, 4-7, and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and we studied changes in serum CTM levels over time. Mean serum CTM levels were 62.3 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 16.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after the injection, with the half-life of 3.6 hours, for the 0-3 day-old premature infants. They were 38.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 10.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 2.9 hours, for the 0-3 day-old neonates. Those levels were 22.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.9 hours, for the 4-7 day-old neonates, and 51.8 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 1.0 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.1 hours, for the greater than or equal to 8 day-old neonates. The CTM was given to 0-3 and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and changes in serum CTM levels after the infusion were followed. The 0-3 day-old premature infant (there was only one subject) had a peak serum CTM level of 21.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after the start of the infusion (that is, at the time of its completion), with the level decreased to 8.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours and the half-life was 5.4 hours. The mean peak serum CTM level in 0-3 day-old neonates were 36.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, which decreased to a mean of 7.0 micrograms/ml at 7 hours; the half-life was 2.3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  - We described previously (W.M. Shafer, L.E. Martin, and J.K. Spitznagel, Infect. Immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37K CAP) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). In this investigation, we prepared 37K CAP from PMN granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. At concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37K CAP exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria included Acinetobacter lwoffii, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei. However, at 5 micrograms of 37K CAP per ml, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. The bactericidal activity of 37K CAP was greatest in acidic (pH 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (pH 7.5) media. The level of S. typhimurium resistance to 37K CAP correlated with the presence of O antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. In the absence of O antigen repeat units, resistance was proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. These results suggest that 37K CAP may contribute significantly to the ability of PMN to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  - Bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in U.S. medical care facilities. This bacteriuria is polymicrobial and dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. We compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. The commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) CFU/ml of urine specimen. Organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. However, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like Providencia stuartii and Morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. More complete reporting may lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. This, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of severe urinary tract infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Aztreonam was administered to 30 patients, ages 0.03 to 15.4 years, with severe and in 21 cases complicated urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to the study drug in vitro. A mean dose of 47.7 mg/kg was given intramuscularly every 12 h to 26 patients. In four patients with renal insufficiency, the dose was reduced according to pharmacokinetic data. Permanent urine sterilization and clinical cure were achieved in 22 patients, 13 of whom had urological malformations. In two patients with P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis infections, the treatment failed. Another patient had an Escherichia coli reinfection 21 days after the end of therapy. Four patients with various urological abnormalities had gram-positive superinfections, and two patients had gram-negative superinfections during and at the end of therapy: all six had indwelling ureteric splints or pyelostomy as predisposing conditions. No adverse clinical effects were observed. Some transient and slight or moderate alterations were observed at the end of treatment: eosinophilia (nine cases), elevation of hepatic enzymes (eight cases), prolongation of prothrombin time (three cases), and neutropenia (one case). A pharmacokinetic study was performed in six patients with normal renal function and in seven patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency. The elimination half-life of the drug was inversely correlated with the glomerular filtration rate. At the dosage used, aztreonam proved effective for severe urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in pediatric patients.

TI  - Dissemination of a gentamicin resistance plasmid in the microbial population of hospital patients.
AB  - The dissemination of a gentamicin resistant plasmid, originally found in strains  of Klebsiella and termed pk181, into the microbial population of patients of the Orvieto Hospital was studied during 1982. Five hundred and seventy-four strains of Gram-negative bacilli were examined, transferable gentamicin resistance being revealed in five different bacterial species. The resistance was shown to be encoded by 81-megadalton plasmids in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, and by 93-megadalton plasmids in Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas spp. Restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid DNA showed that the fragment patterns of the 81-megadalton plasmids from E. coli and enterobacter cloacae were identical to one another and to the pattern of plasmid pk181. The fragment patterns of the 93-megadalton plasmids from Serratia and Pseudomonas, on the contrary, differed substantially from those of the 81-megadalton plasmids.
TI  - Susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides. Effects of 45 months of amikacin as first-line aminoglycoside therapy.
AB  - Amikacin was instituted as the primary empiric aminoglycoside at the San Juan Veterans Administration Medical Center in January 1982; at that time, 16 percent of the strains at the hospital were gentamicin-resistant. A prospective surveillance study was designed to correlate detection of bacterial resistance with aminoglycoside use. In the current report, the baseline period, during which gentamicin was the first-line aminoglycoside, accounting for 61 percent of overall aminoglycoside use, is compared with the period from January 1982 to September 1985, during which the first-line aminoglycoside was amikacin, accounting for 85 percent of overall use. This study is ongoing. During the two periods, the patient population did not differ with regard to aminoglycoside therapy, indications, or overall aminoglycoside use (541 versus 680 patient days per month). Among the gram-negative bacilli isolated, the percent of strains resistant to amikacin was as follows: pre-baseline period/baseline period, 0.8/0.2 percent; amikacin-usage period, 3.6 percent. Resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin during the period of amikacin use decreased from 16 to 11 percent for gentamicin and from 17 to 11 percent for tobramycin. The decrease in resistance of the gram-negative bacilli to gentamicin varied among strains: the resistance of Escherichia coli decreased from 8 to 4 percent; that of Proteus mirabilis, from 12 to 5 percent; that of indole-positive Proteus, from 19 to 12 percent; that of Acinetobacter, from 57 to 23 percent; that of Citrobacter, from 15 to 7 percent; and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 24 to 16 percent. During the amikacin-usage period, amikacin resistance was unchanged for most strains, with the exception of P. aeruginosa, the resistance of which increased from 4.5 to 7.8 percent. Of the 4,795 strains isolated, 174 were resistant to amikacin; of these, 29 Pseudomonas strains were studied for all mechanisms of resistance. Changes in permeability were exhibited by 11 of the 29 strains; 14 strains exhibited the AAC(6')-I enzyme, 10 strains exhibited the APH(3')-II enzyme, and two strains exhibited ANT(2") in addition to some other unidentified mechanism. Multiple enzyme production was found in 15 of the strains. The use of amikacin as a first-line aminoglycoside is associated with a decrease in resistance to other aminoglycosides and a slight increase in overall resistance to amikacin among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The usefulness of amikacin has not been affected at our institution.

AB  - We describe the emergence of three thymidine-dependent strains (Thy-): two Escherichia coli obtained in successive occasions from urine of a woman treated with co-trimoxazole before the organisms were isolated and one Proteus mirabilis obtained from urine of a man who had a treatment with norfloxacin. Cultural characteristics and methods for the detection of these Thy- strains are given.

AB  - 28 patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) were treated with norfloxacin 2 X 400 mg daily for 9 days. 14 of these patients had complicated UTI (stones, obstruction). The main pathogens were E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. On the third day of treatment all bacteria were eradicated. One week after therapy all patients with uncomplicated UTI were cured and, likewise, 9 of 14 with complicated UTI. There was no laboratory evidence of adverse effects. 6 patients reported only mild side effects such as epigastric pain, dizziness and pruritus, which did not necessitate discontinuation of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of UTI.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to bladder uroepithelial cells in catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  - To assess the role of bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the pathogenesis of nosocomial urinary tract infection, we prospectively studied 55 patients with indwelling urinary catheters. We obtained uroepithelial cells from the bladder and urine for culture on the patients' entry into the study and every two to four days during catheterization. In all, 235 collections of uroepithelial cells from these patients were used in an in vitro adherence assay with six gram-negative bacterial strains. With uroepithelial cells from patients who did not have bacterial infections, the adherence of the bacteria used in the assay differed significantly according to species. The least adherence occurred with Escherichia coli GR12; the adherence increased with (in order) Proteus mirabilis, E. coli J96, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With cells collected just before the onset of bacteriuria, adherence of these gram-negative strains was higher in patients in whom gram-negative rod infections developed than in those with gram-positive coccal infections (P = 0.005). Analysis with the Cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated that a significant increase in bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the bladder occurred two to four days before the onset of bacteriuria, but that adherence returned to base-line values with the onset of bacteriuria. These results suggest that a transient increase in the adherence of gram-negative bacteria to bladder epithelial cells may be an important early event in the development of catheter-associated bacteriuria.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MICs for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for Streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. CI-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to CI-934. CI-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii. The medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of CI-934. Magnesium at a concentration of 9 mM increased MICs and MBCs four- to eightfold, and testing at pH 6 increased MICs as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with MICs at pH 7. The frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - Cephalosporins in cutaneous infections. A prospective comparison of two dosage regimens of ceftazidime for therapy of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of ceftazidime administered as 0.5 g every 8 hours (q8h)  or 1.0 g q8h for at least 5 days were compared in 197 patients and found to be effective in the treatment of cellulitis, abscesses, skin ulcers, and wound infections. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogen in both treatment groups with approximately half of the isolates from each treatment group being gram-positive. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common gram-negative isolate. P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli each comprised 5-12% of the isolates from each treatment group. Clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 98.7% of the patients in each treatment group. Concurrently with clinically successful treatment, a high rate of bacteriologic eradication without superinfection was achieved with the 0.5-g regimen (84% of all isolates) and the 1.0-g regimen (92%).

TI  - Expression of the Proteus mirabilis lipoprotein gene in Escherichia coli. Existence of tandem promoters.
AB  - The Ipp gene from Proteus mirabilis was cloned onto pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The P. mirabilis lpp gene is unique in that it has two tandem promoters transcribing two mRNAs that differ in length by approximately 70 nucleotides at their 5'-ends. The two mRNAs thus encode the identical lipoprotein. The P. mirabilis prolipoprotein has a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 59-amino acid lipoprotein sequence. In spite of the substantial differences in the amino acid sequence from the E. coli prolipoprotein, the P. mirabilis prolipoprotein is normally modified and processed in E. coli, and the resultant lipoprotein is assembled in the E. coli outer membrane as is the E. coli lipoprotein.
TI  - Self-disinfecting plastics for intravenous catheters and prosthetic inserts.
AB  - A disinfectant (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether: Irgasan, Ciba-Geigy) was incorporated into plastic washers fabricated from ethylvinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene, polypropylene or TPX. Plastics containing 0.2 and 2% Irgasan gave zones of inhibition on nutrient and blood agar plates seeded with micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis or Candida albicans) even after thorough washing. Exceptionally, C. albicans was inhibited only by 2% Irgasan, and EVA gave good inhibition only against the staphylococci. Similar washers of each plastic were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of rabbits; before insertion each was washed, had thread woven into it and was surrounded by a plasma clot containing 2 X 10(8) Staph. aureus. All the plastics without Irgasan gave rise to abscesses, none of the plastics impregnated with 2% Irgasan did, though from 2 out of 12 sites small numbers of Staph. aureus were isolated at post mortem. Using either clinical or bacteriological criteria, the results were highly significant (P less than 0.00001 and P less than 0.001 respectively), demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in preventing plastic-associated infection.
TI  - Effect of inoculum size on ampicillin and amoxycillin susceptibility determined by gas-liquid chromatography for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Inoculum size had only a small effect on the results for ampicillin and amoxycillin susceptibility testing of Escherichia coli. In contrast, a difference in inoculum size from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml profoundly affected the results for ampicillin and amoxycillin susceptibility testing of Proteus mirabilis, causing a change from susceptibility to complete resistance. These different effects of inoculum size were observed both when susceptibility was determined by the suppression of a characteristic metabolic product analyzed by head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC) and when it was determined by MIC testing in broth. Inoculum size affected the results for ampicillin susceptibility of P. mirabilis determined concurrently with the rapid HS-GLC urine test, because 10(8) CFU/ml may occur in urine specimens. In the rapid test, significant numbers of Escherichia, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Proteus, Morganella, and Providencia spp. in urine specimens are detected within 4 h by HS-GLC analysis for characteristic metabolic products in cultures. Most P. mirabilis in urine specimens appeared to be ampicillin resistant in the rapid HS-GLC test but were reported to be ampicillin susceptible in hospital laboratory agar dilution tests 2 days later. However, ampicillin susceptibility results for Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Citrobacter spp. agreed with hospital laboratory reports. It was concluded that reports of ampicillin susceptibility or resistance for the commonest cause of urinary tract infections, E. coli, within 4 h of receipt of the specimen would be clinically valuable and that a provisional report of ampicillin resistance for P. mirabilis would not lead to ineffective therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - The diffusion of pefloxacin into bone and the treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Pefloxacin was evaluated in the treatment of bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 15 patients with chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Serratia sp., 1 Proteus mirabilis, and a mixed infection with a Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). Patients were given pefloxacin 400 mg 12-hourly iv for 48 h followed by oral treatment. Bone biopsies from the iliac crest were carried out after at least seven days treatment, 2 h after the last dose. Serum levels were estimated at the same time. In 13 patients the pefloxacin levels were between 2 and 10 mg per g of bone and always greater than, or equal to, the MIC for the infecting organism. In 11 patients treated for six months and followed up for up to 14 months after the completion of treatment, the therapy was successful. In another two patients, the results were excellent with closure of fistulae, but there was only limited follow-up. There were two failures: in one (post-radiation osteitis) the infection persisted and in the other there was intolerance of the antimicrobial. In both cases there was no increase in the MIC of pefloxacin against the organisms. Three patients underwent operations for orthopaedic indications, after at least two months of treatment. Bone cultures from the initial focus remained sterile. Side-effects were mild.
TI  - Escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. In vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  - The first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. Removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. To develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence screening assay, we studied the adherence of Escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. The results can be summarized as follows: Although E. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). Agents which did not effect E. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. Agents which inhibited E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited E. coli adherence to the resin. Similar to the effect of heparin on E. coli attachment, the adherence of Klebsiella ozaene, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. These studies indicate that the adherence of E. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - The efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  - A reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. Pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. A 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. The intestine was then divided at each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. The segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. This experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. Within three days 40% of the animals receiving pefloxacin died. Animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only 5% of these animals died. Thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Crystallization of recA protein from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The recA protein from Proteus mirabilis, which is homologous to the Escherichia coli protein, forms crystals in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). There are two 38,000 molecular weight subunits in the asymmetric unit and the unit cell dimensions are a = 57.5, b = 127.0 and c = 157.0 A.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic consequences of amikacin use during a 42-month period.
AB  - In June 1980, 23% of our Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and 53% of our Serratia  species were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin. During a 3 1/2-year period of almost exclusive amikacin usage, we noted a fall in overall resistance of gram-negative organisms to tobramycin and gentamicin from 18.8% and 19.3% to 15.2% and 16.2%, respectively. This fall in resistance was most notable for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia species. During this period there was no increase in amikacin resistance. Age, hospitalization, prior antibiotic therapy, and Foley catheter use were predisposing factors in acquiring amikacin-resistant organisms. Amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli were usually sensitive to newer penicillins or cephalosporins.
TI  - [Frequency of isolation and drug resistance of bacterial strains from urine samples tested in the Bacteriology and Virology Laboratory of the U.S.L. 10/D in Florence].
AB  - Two thousand five hundred and sixty-eight positive monomicrobic urine samples (from general practice and hospital wards) were examined and isolated strains were tested against various antimicrobial drugs. Our findings showed that urinary-tract infections caused by Escherichia coli were the most common in females, whereas those by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter species, other difficult Gram-negative rods and Streptococcus faecalis were in total the most common in males. If we compare the strains isolated from general practice with those from the hospital, no significant differences were observed. E. coli strains were the most susceptible to the tested drugs; cefotaxime, amikacin, cefuroxime and ceftazidime were the most effective drugs against Enterobacter species, Ps. aeruginosa, P. rettgeri and Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis and Str. faecalis strains isolated in the hospital were more chemo-resistant than those isolated in general practice. Ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole were less active against E. coli strains isolated from children's departments in comparison with the others.
TI  - Opportunistic bacteria isolated from the caecum of rabbits with mucoid enteritis.
AB  
TI  - Neutrophil activity in abscess-bearing mice: comparative studies with neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, elicited peritoneal exudates, and abscesses.
AB  - Intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. Six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous Percoll density gradients. Neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. When the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not change significantly. This anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture that included Proteus mirabilis plus B. fragilis and from those induced by E. coli plus P. mirabilis. While unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. Neutrophils from abscesses induced by P. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. In contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they could kill added S. aureus. Neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. The mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism S. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. SK&F 88070 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. It was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus. SK&F 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to SK&F 88070. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the Proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. SK&F 88070 inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - The effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine as an disinfectant in eye surgery.
AB  - 105 patients admitted for cataract surgery were treated pre-operatively with polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVP-I) as a disinfectant, and consecutive bacterial cultures were obtained before initiating surgery and at the end of the operation. A control group (n = 99) only had a standard disinfection procedure of the eye (including instillation of Terramycin cum polymyxin B cream in the conjunctival sac the evening before surgery). The cultures obtained from the conjunctival sac of the control group principally showed growth of Staph. albus and Staph. aureus, and to a minor degree diphtheroids (Corynebacterium species). Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and micrococci. There was a significant quantitative diminished growth (P less than 0.05) of bacteria in the group of patients treated with PVP-I compared to the control group. Concerning the growth of Staph. albus, this was reduced to almost one third and other bacteria were almost eliminated in the group receiving PVP-I. As we disclosed no toxic or allergic reaction post-operatively which could be related to the use of PVP-I as a disinfectant, this agent seems to constitute an effective pre-operative antimicrobial treatment, taking into consideration the broad antimicrobial spectrum of PVP-I shown by other authors.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in Hungary.
AB  - This survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by Public Health Network laboratories in 1983. Facultatively pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except Escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. Oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against Staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. In contrast to other streptococci, all Streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. The majority of the Gram-positive strains were resistant to tetracycline. A comparison to results reported earlier (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. Resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of Proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. Emergence of Haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of P. mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. The increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. In some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. A restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. Multiresistant Gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in Hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a representative clinical material. The frequent occurrence of multiresistant P. mirabilis and Acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. Surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant E. coli strains was very low. Amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - The combination of pivampicillin and pivmecillinam versus pivampicillin alone in  the treatment of acute pyelonephritis.
AB  - 96 patients with clinical symptoms of acute pyelonephritis were randomized to 2 weeks treatment with either a fixed combination of pivampicillin and pivmecillinam or to pivampicillin alone. If needed, treatment was first started with the respective parenteral equivalents of the drugs. Acute pyelonephritis was bacteriologically verified in 57 patients, in whom Escherichia coli was isolated in 80% of the cases, Klebsiella in 7% and Proteus mirabilis in 5%. 22 of the 39 patients excluded did not have significant bacteriuria (less than 10(8) c.f.u./l). Combination treatment was superior to pivampicillin/ampicillin alone, in terms of clinical effect, with successful treatment being noted in 93% in the combination group and in 53% in the ampicillin group (p = 0.002). The combination was also more effective bacteriologically and it did not select resistant strains in the urinary tract. Ampicillin treatment alone, was, however, associated with a significant increase in urinary strains resistant to ampicillin and to mecillinam. Unsuccessful responders had a significantly higher mean age (p less than 0.01) than successful responders. No serious side-effects were noted.
TI  - Ferric ammonium citrate decomposition--a taxonomic tool for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The iron uptake test of Szabo and Vandra has been modified and used for the differentiation of Gram-negative bacteria. Nutrient agar containing 20 g per litre of ferric ammonium citrate was distributed into narrow tubes and solidified so as to form butts and slants. Considering the localization of the rusty-brown coloration produced after seeding and incubation, 2367 strains were classified into four groups. (1) Unchanged medium: Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Hafnia alvei and Morganella morganii 100% each, Klebsiella spp., 50%, Enterobacter cloacae 37%, Proteus vulgaris 59%, Acinetobacter spp. 42%, Pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) Rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: Salmonella subgenera II, III and IV 98%, Citrobacter freundii 65%, E. cloacae 55%, P. vulgaris 41%, Proteus mirabilis 98%, Providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative Providencia 96%, Acinetobacter spp. 58%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, P. fluorescens 81%, UFP (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads) 100%, other Pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) Unchanged slant, brown butt: S. typhi 88%, Salmonella subgenus I 3%, Klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) Rusty-brown slant, brown butt: Salmonella subgenus I 75%, C. freundii 20%, Klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. Colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. The localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in Simmons' minimal and in Kauffmann's peptone water medium.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Comparison of effectiveness of aminoglycosides and cephalosporins in gram-negative rods.
AB  - Aminoglycosides and cephalosporins belong among antimicrobials with a pronounced  effect on most gram-negative rods. In vitro susceptibility and resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefoperazone in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested by the quantitative dilution micromethod. Selected, highly susceptible strains of the above species were furthermore compared for minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Aminoglycosides tended to be the most effective drugs for susceptible strains. In view of their relative toxicity possibly optimal combinations of individual aminoglycosides with individual cephalosporins are discussed.
TI  - Expression of the Proteus mirabilis recA gene in Bacillus subtilis is directed by its own promoter.
AB  - The recA gene of Proteus mirabilis (recApm) has been cloned into the PstI site of the Bacillus promoter-probe plasmid pPL603. When present on this plasmid, the recApm1) gene is expressed in B. subtilis under the control of its own transcriptional and translational signals. It is concluded that the high AT-content of the DNA sequence upstream of the -35 region is of decisive importance for the usage of the recApm promoter by the B. subtilis RNA polymerase. The results are discussed in relation to the expression barriers found to exist for genes from gram-negative bacteria in the gram-positive B. subtilis.
TI  - Providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  - The long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to Providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. Published accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that P. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has commonly differed among institutions. In the future P. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. This trend appears likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by P. stuartii.
TI  - [Clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  - In a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). All the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone or in combination with surgical intervention. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. The 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had MICs between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. The MICs for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the MICs for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. One S. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (MIC 16 mg/l). The tolerability was good. Phlebitis was observed in one case only. Based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - [Similar organization of beta,beta'-subunit RNA-polymerase genes and adjacent ribosomal protein genes in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - The genes coding for the RNA-polymerase beta,beta'-subunits and adjacent ribosomal protein genes in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas putida are compared by the Southern hybridization procedure. In all the species studied close clustering of the genes rplKAJL and rpoBC is demonstrated. Preliminary physical maps for these genes in S. typhimurium, S. flexneri, S. marcescens and P. mirabilis are proposed. Rifampicin is shown to stimulate the beta,beta'-subunit synthesis in all the species studied, suggesting the existence of attenuators localized in front of the rpoBC genes. The similar arrangement of the genes rplKAJLrpoBC in a number of bacterial species is proposed to be due to common mechanisms of their coordinate expression.
TI  - [The capacity of anaerobically grown bacteria to exchange the 2H+ of the cell for the K+ of the medium and to maintain a high K+ distribution between cell and medium].
AB  - The N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2H+ of a cell for K+ of medium stable to pH, K+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium. S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus salivarius, L. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. This exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. The high K+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2H+ for one K+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. In aerobically grown E. coli, S. typhimurium, Brevibacterium flavum and aerobic Micrococcus luteus exchange of 2H+ for K+ does not take place, the K+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. It is assumed that exchange of 2H+ for K+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the H+-ATPase complex and the Trk (or Trk-like) system of K+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the H+-K+-pump and supports the high K+ distribution between cell and medium.
TI  - Bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  - The pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. Four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. Of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected. Quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. Pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. The results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), the product of the malE gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. It is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer Tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). In studies of the maltose system in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, we found that MBP is produced by Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. MBP from all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the E. coli protein and had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). The Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize MBP. The isoelectric points of MBP from different species varied from the acid extreme of E. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of E. aerogenes (8.9). All species with MBP transported maltose with high affinity, although the Vmax for K. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. Maltose chemotaxis was observed only in E. coli and E. aerogenes. In S. typhimurium LT2, Tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. MBP isolated from all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta malE strain of E. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Changes in resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics of different bacterial strains isolated during the period 1978 to 1983. Netilmicin as alternative therapy.
AB  - The percentage resistance of 11,404 gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from different biological materials between 1978 and 1983 to some aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin) was determined. The percentage of resistant Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and indole-positive Proteus organisms significantly increased. There was also a significant decrease in gentamicin-resistant strains of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis species. We also compared the in vitro activity of netilmicin (routinely tested from the beginning of 1983) with those of the other aminoglycosides against 1546 bacterial strains. Netilmicin was found to have greater antibacterial activity than gentamicin or tobramycin. In addition, netilmicin was active against 48.9% of the strains that were resistant to gentamicin and/or tobramycin.
TI  - An investigation into in vitro methods for the detection of chlorhexidine resistance.
AB  - During an outbreak of catheter-related urinary tract infection, due to Proteus mirabilis, it was suggested that the epidemic strain was resistant to chlorhexidine. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine to the epidemic Pr. mirabilis and other laboratory isolates were tested in different media. Results were compared with killing times using 1/4 strength Ringers solution, normal human urine and the in vivo killing times in two patients' catheter bags. It was found that the MIC test was unreliable in the assessment of chlorhexidine resistance as it was dependent on the medium used, the inoculum size, and the age of the culture. The test which gave results closest to the in vivo experiments was the killing curve in normal human urine. It is concluded that chlorhexidine resistance is a complex phenomenon which is difficult to evaluate. If in vitro tests are to be used to evaluate the clinical relevance of reduced sensitivity to chlorhexidine, they must mimic the in-use conditions as closely as possible.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  - The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of amifloxacin (WIN 49, 375), a new quinolone agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amifloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Aeromonas, Salmonella, Shigella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter species, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. Amifloxacin inhibited Branhamella, Haemophilus, and Neisseria at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, and 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin- and carbenicillin-resistant isolates, at 4 micrograms/ml. It also inhibited staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but was less active against streptococci and Bacteroides species. Amifloxacin had in vitro activity similar to enoxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin, but was less active than ciprofloxacin. Like other quinolones, it was less active at acid pH and in the presence of urine.
TI  - [Changes in the migration and adhesive activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes as 1 of the characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with suppurative lung destruction].
AB  - The influence of Gram-negative bacteria on the migratory and adhesive activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in the peripheral blood of clinically normal donors has been studied by the specially developed method with the use of Boyden chambers. Pseudomonas and enterobacteria have been found to produce complex and various effects on the above-mentioned properties of PMNL. When incubated in fresh serum, Gram-negative bacteria are capable of enhancing the migratory activity of PMNL, this property being least pronounced in P. aeruginosa. The incubation of live bacteria from the authors' collection in the patients' sera or in sera obtained from normal donors and inactivated by heating induces no hemotaxis of PMNL, and P. aeruginosa strains even suppress it under such conditions. The isolated Gram-negative bacteria under study increase the number of highly adhesive PMNL in the population used in this investigation, but P. aeruginosa cultures do not produce such effect.
TI  - Bacteriology and ultrastructure of the bladder in patients with urinary tract infections.
AB  - Tissue obtained by biopsy of the bladder from 33 patients with various urinary tract symptoms was studied by conventional bacteriological techniques and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All the patients had recurrent urinary tract symptoms which had not completely responded to antibiotic therapy. Eleven of the patients had greater than or equal to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria/1 urine; six had between 10(6) and 10(7) CFU/1, and 16 were abacteruric. Bacteria were isolated, however, from the tissue obtained by biopsy from eight of the 16 patients with sterile urine and bacteria were seen on the uro-epithelium in 14 of these patients. By comparison, in all samples of tissue obtained from the 11 patients with greater than or equal to 10(8) CFU/1 of urine bacteria were seen on the uro-epithelium and from nine of these, bacteria were subsequently grown. Fastidious organisms were not isolated from any of the patients. The uro-epithelium of all those studied was also shown to be grossly disrupted with increased disturbance and loss of the epithelial cells when compared with tissue obtained from uninfected patients. The degree of uro-epithelial disturbance was greatest in patients with histories of urinary tract infections lasting more than 4 months. The findings suggest that bacteriological examination of the urine does not always reflect bacterial infection on the bladder surface nor disruption of the uro-epithelium. The changes on the bladder surface may explain the patients' symptoms. In view of the results, a scheme is proposed that explains the development of symptoms in patients with urinary tract and bladder infections.
TI  - Further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence agents. The studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. Results are as follows. 1) Heparin inhibits the adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus fecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) Drugs which inhibit E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit E. coli adherence to the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect E. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) Extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent E. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) The ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. Similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. These studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - Role of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in endometritis after cesarean section.
AB  - Endometritis is considered to be a polymicrobial infection, involving aerobes, anaerobes, and genital mycoplasmas. Aerobic gram-negative rods make up 7%-25% of all genital isolates, but findings from studies in which special collection techniques were used suggest that many of these may be contaminants from the lower genital tract. Bacteremia occurs in 4%-30% of patients with endometritis, and aerobic gram-negative rods account for approximately 25% of blood isolates. Both selected therapy studies and studies of intrauterine cultures collected at surgery from patients at risk for endometritis suggest the significant role of aerobic gram-negative rods. Among them Escherichia coli is the most common isolate in both genital and blood cultures. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis rank next, followed by Enterobacter species. Pseudomonas species account for fewer than 0.6% of genital isolates. Overall, aerobic gram-negative rods are causally involved in 10%-20% of cases of endometritis following cesarean section.
TI  - Comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin was carried out in 49 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment drug. Clindamycin was given concomitantly until the pathogen was identified and the presence of a gram-positive microorganism was ruled out. Samples of sputum were obtained for culture from the lung parenchyma by deep expectoration or transtracheal aspiration. A pathogen was defined as an organism that showed heavy growth and predominated in the culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of less common pathogens were represented. Thirty-five patients were treated with intravenous aztreonam (1-2 g every 8 hr) and 14 with intravenous tobramycin (3-5 mg/kg per day) until they were afebrile and sputum cultures had been free of the pathogen for 48 hr. The minimum duration of treatment was five days. In the aztreonam group, only two (5%) of the 37 gram-negative pathogens--one P. aeruginosa and one Escherichia coli--persisted. In the tobramycin group, seven (50%) of the 14 pathogens persisted. Clinical response paralleled microbiologic response. Adverse effects in both treatment groups were minor and transient. In this trial aztreonam was effective and safe for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa and a variety of other gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Cell cycle parameters of Proteus mirabilis: interdependence of the biosynthetic cell cycle and the interdivision cycle.
AB  - We investigated the time periods of DNA replication, lateral cell wall extension, and septum formation within the cell cycle of Proteus mirabilis. Cells were cultivated under three different conditions, yielding interdivision times of approximately 55, 57, and 160 min, respectively. Synchrony was achieved by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The time periods were estimated by division inhibition studies with cephalexin, mecillinam, and nalidixic acid. In addition, DNA replication was measured by thymidine incorporation, and murein biosynthesis was measured by incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine into sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble murein sacculi. At interdivision times of 55 to 57 min murein biosynthesis for reproduction of a unit cell lasted longer than the interdivision time itself, whereas DNA replication finished within 40 min. Surprisingly, inhibition of DNA replication by nalidixic acid did not inhibit the subsequent cell division but rather the one after that. Because P. mirabilis fails to express several reactions of the recA-dependent SOS functions known from Escherichia coli, the drug allowed us to determine which DNA replication period actually governed which cell division. Taken together, the results indicate that at an interdivision time of 55 to 57 min, the biosynthetic cell cycle of P. mirabilis lasts approximately 120 min. To achieve the observed interdivision time, it is necessary that two subsequent biosynthetic cell cycles be tightly interlocked. The implications of these findings for the regulation of the cell cycle are discussed.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - Evolution of the lipoprotein gene in the enterobacteriaceae. Cloning and DNA sequence of the lpp gene from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - We cloned the lipoprotein gene from Proteus mirabilis and determined its DNA sequence. Comparison with the lpp genes from Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Erwinia amylovora and Morganella morganii revealed several unique features of the evolution of the lpp gene in the Enterobacteriaceae and enabled us to establish phylogenetic relationships between these bacteria.
TI  - Population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (CTX) in eight species of Enterobacteriaceae was carried out. One strain of each species was examined. The strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (A) and carbenicillin (Ca). Cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. The populations of the A-susceptible/Ca-susceptible (A-s/Ca-s) species, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to CTX. The A-resistant/Ca-resistant (A-r/Ca-r) species, Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. The four A-r/Ca-s species, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. The frequency of CTX-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). The IC50 for CTX was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. The CTX resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. All four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the strains selected in the population analysis. Only the enzyme of Proteus vulgaris was able to hydrolyze CTX.
TI  - [Carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  - Of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (Amp-R) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between July and December 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (Carb-R). This particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive Proteus (23%), Enterobacter cloacae (64%), Citrobacter freundii (67%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), Proteus mirabilis (75%), Serratia marcescens (90%), Escherichia coli (91%), Providencia stuartii (96%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). The biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. A constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. These enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. Two types of enzymes were predominant: TEM-1 (20 strains) and TEM-2 (7 strains); two strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae produced both SHV-1 and TEM-1. The transfer by conjugation to E. coli K12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (E. coli: 9, C. freundii: 1, K. pneumoniae: 1, E. cloacae: 2, P. stuartii: 1). In all strains but one E. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Resistance to chloramphenicol in Proteus mirabilis by expression of a chromosomal gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis PM13 is a well-characterized chloramphenicol-sensitive isolate  which spontaneously gives rise to resistant colonies on solid media containing chloramphenicol (50 micrograms ml-1) at a plating efficiency of 10(-4) to 10(-5). Such chloramphenicol-resistant colonies exhibit a novel phenotype with respect to chloramphenicol resistance. When a single colony grown on chloramphenicol agar is transferred to liquid medium and grown in the absence of antibiotic for 150 generations, a population of predominantly sensitive cells arises. This mutation-reversion phenomenon has been observed in other Proteus species and Providencia strains, wherein resistance has been shown to be mediated in each case by the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The cat gene responsible for the phenomenon is chromosomal and can be cloned from P. mirabilis PM13 with DNA prepared from cells grown in the absence or the presence of chloramphenicol. Recombinant plasmids which confer resistance to chloramphenicol carry an 8.5-kilobase PstI fragment irrespective of the source of host DNA. The location of the cat gene within the PstI fragment was determined by Southern blotting with a cat consensus oligonucleotide corresponding to the expected amino acid sequence of the active site region of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and the direction of transcription was deduced from homology with the type I cat variant.
TI  - Necrosis and abscessation of placental sites in a Pekingese bitch.
AB  - An 18-month-old Pekingese bitch aborted 7 foetuses at Day 55 of pregnancy. Necrosis and/or abscessation of all 7 placental sites were found following a panhysterectomy performed 4 days later. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and a beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. were cultured from the vaginal discharge and from a uterine abscess.
TI  - Effects of antimicrobial agents fed to chickens on some gram-negative enteric bacilli.
AB  - Total and antimicrobial agent-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in fecal samples of broiler chickens fed growth-promotional levels of antimicrobial agents were determined quantitatively. Two 8-week studies were conducted utilizing groups of chickens fed antimicrobial-supplemented rations; the second study involved feed "pasteurization" as a means of minimizing colonization from the feed. Dilution/spread-plating/replica-plating techniques on selective media were used to obtain counts of total organisms and those resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, ampicillin, or kanamycin. The predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative organism was Escherichia coli, which was detected in all samples at levels ranging from 10(5) to over 10(10) CFU/g of feces. Less common were Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas sp., which varied in occurrence and levels from group to group (range, less than 10(3) to 10(8) CFU/g). Resistance to all antimicrobials (except chloramphenicol in E. coli) was commonly observed at incidences exceeding 10(3) CFU/g in the total populations. Colonization of the chickens' intestinal tracts by susceptible and resistant strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas sp. appeared to result from their presence in the environment of the newly hatched chickens. Ration pasteurization did affect P. mirabilis, which appeared to colonize from the feed. The results suggest that colonization by, and proliferation of, antimicrobial-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in chicken intestinal tracts may be less dependent on selection through antimicrobial supplementation of the ration than on their prevalence in environments from which they can colonize newborns.
TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of amikacin in dogs.
AB  - After IV, IM, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. The pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. Amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. Intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- SD, n = 4). Within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. For isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. Cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. Widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. For dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (IM or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1983). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of antibiotics against causative pathogens  isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) in the 8 institutions in Japan during the period from 1980 to 1983 were compared. A number of new beta-lactam antibiotics with broad spectrum of activity have become available for clinical use in recent years. Some of them, in particular so-called third generation cephems, are reported to be responsible for developing microbial-cross resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. We have been making survey in recent years to explore changes in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents of clinical isolates. All bacterial isolates from clinical specimens were submitted to the Department of Clinical Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, where they were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with MIC 2000 apparatus. Of all pathogens from patients with simple UTI, the majority of the isolates was E. coli and Klebsiella spp. In cases of complicated UTI, on the other hand, Pseudomonas spp. were most frequent, followed in order by Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp. and E. coli. Conspicuous changes in antimicrobial activity of antibiotics against E. coli and Klebsiella spp. from simple UTI have not been found in our survey. Against strains of Citrobacter spp., even the third generation cephems proved to be not remarkably active and there was a significant decrease in susceptibility of isolates to the drugs test-showed MIC values of 50 micrograms/ml and the proportion increased to 50% (22/44) with isolates obtained in 1982. The antimicrobial activity of cefsulodin and gentamicin against P. aeruginosa was decreased in 1982 compared with that in 1980 and 1981. However, resistant strains were slightly more frequent with gentamicin. In 1983, the antimicrobial activity of third generation cephems against Serratia spp. was significantly reduced from that in 1982.
TI  - [Comparative activity of norfloxacin and other chemotherapeutic agents on the adhesion of bacteria of the uro-vaginal tract to uroepithelial cells].
AB  - A number of bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and streptococci), obtained from patients with urinary infections, or from vaginal tampons, were assayed in order to evaluate their ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells. We employed, at a comparative purpose, two different methods to eliminate unattached bacteria: the centrifugation technique and the filtration technique. The effect of the pretreatment with subinhibitory concentrations of three chemotherapeutics widely employed in the urological practice (norfloxacin, pipemidic acid and co-trimoxazole) was determined on the strains which demonstrated a good rate of attachment. Growth in the presence of any of the three drugs decreased the adhesive properties of the microorganisms, reducing both the haemagglutination and the yeast aggregation titers of Gram-negative bacteria as well as their adhesiveness. Norfloxacin proved to be the most effective drug in affecting the pathogenicity characteristics of the assayed strains in comparison with the other two chemotherapeutics tested, even if they were also moderately able to inhibit the adhesiveness of the same strains.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - Role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. Cultures prior to therapy yielded Staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group D and non-group D enterococci (49), group A streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), Escherichia coli (32), Proteus mirabilis (31), Enterobacter (21), Klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), Bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). Overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). Of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. Many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. Serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. Eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven P. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). Such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. Imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these bacteria is suspected or proved.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from Nsukka meat market: a zoonotic appraisal.
AB  - Swabs collected from butchers hands, knives, tables and meat displayed for sale at Nsukka meat market showed that every item screened was contaminated. Bacteria isolated include Streptococcus faecalis, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Brucella species, Corynebacterium haemolyticum, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas multophilia, P. rubescens and beta-haemolytic Streptococci. The zoonotic or public health implications of such contaminations, their probable sources and possible ways of minimizing them are discussed.
TI  - In vitro comparative antimicrobial activity of cefpimizole against clinical isolates from five medical centers.
AB  - Cefpimizole was compared with cefoperazone and cefotaxime against 6,599 clinical  bacterial isolates from five medical centers. Cefoperazone and cefotaxime were both more active and provided a greater spectrum of antimicrobial coverage than cefpimizole. Some of the cefpimizole minimum concentrations inhibiting 50% of tested strains were as follows: Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, 16 micrograms/ml; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.0 micrograms/ml; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus spp., 32 micrograms/ml; and the enterococci, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Screening of microorganisms for nitrosation catalysis at pH 7 and kinetic studies on nitrosamine formation from secondary amines by E. coli strains.
AB  - Thirty-eight strains of microorganisms isolated from infected human trachea, urine, blood and faeces were examined for their ability to form N-nitrosomorpholine from morpholine and nitrite at pH 7.25. Twenty-five bacterial strains exhibited nitrosation activity, including 18 out of 19 strains of Escherichia coli and three out of nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Neisseria strains; E. coli A10 strain showed the highest activity. Formation of N-nitrosomorpholine was proportional to the incubation time up to 2 h and to the number of resting E. coli A10 cells; the reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Nitrosation rate appeared to be dependent on the pKa value of several amines studied. As the nitrosation catalysis was heat-labile, our data suggest that N-nitrosation is catalysed by a bacterial enzyme(s). This reaction may lead to enhanced endogenous nitrosation in subjects suffering from an achlorhydric stomach or from chronic urinary tract infections.
TI  - [In vitro effect of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Line of regression and critical values].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone, a new third generation cephalosporin, against hospital isolates was investigated. 312 strains belonging to the most commonly recovered species were studied using the following methods: agar diffusion (disk antibiotic testing), agar dilution (determination of MIC) and dilution in a liquid medium with subculture to agar plates (determination of MBC). Except for a few Citrobacter strains and rare Serratia strains, all Enterobacteriaceae tested proved highly susceptible, with MICs less than or equal to 1 mg/l and mode MICs ranging from 0.003 mg/l (Proteus) to 0.25 mg/l (Enterobacter). MICs ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l for Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 mg/l) and 16 to greater than or equal to 128 for Pseudomonas (mode MIC greater than or equal to 128 mg/l). Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were moderately susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC: 2 to 8 mg/l) whereas methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). Bactericidal activity was excellent: MBC/MIC less than or equal to 2 (except for a few Serratia strains). A correlation curve was established. Given the high serum concentrations of ceftriaxone (achieved with the usual maximal dosage) and its unusually extended half-life (7 to 8 h), the following cutoff concentrations can be proposed: C less than or equal to 4 mg/l, corresponding to greater than or equal to 20 mm: susceptible bacteria C greater than 32 mg/l, corresponding to less than 15 mm: resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. II].
AB  - In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as ABPC, SBPC, MPC, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX, CPZ, CFS and GM against major clinical isolates, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, was examined. In this paper, we will report the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. CEZ- and GM-resistant S. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. CMZ and CFS have showed potent activity against CEZ-resistant S. aureus. It seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant S. aureus. The penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of S. pyogenes could not be found in our study. Quite a few strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. Some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to CPZ, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to GM.
TI  - Infection surrounding Meme implants.
AB  
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory properties of a new penem antibiotic, Sch 34343.
AB  - Sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. Its in-vitro activity was determined against Gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. Sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp, Citrobacter spp. and Shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. Ninety per cent of strains of Enterobacter, Morganella and Providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. Sch 34343 did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against Enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. Sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. Sch 34343 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. Sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of Richmond-Sykes type Ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. It induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (HR 810), a pyridine cephalosporin agent active against staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new cyclopyridinium cephalosporin, was evaluated against 947 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefpirome inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Haemophilus and Neisseria species at less than or equal to 0.4 mg/l. It had activity comparable to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and moxalactam against these species. Only a few Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens had MICs above 3.1 mg/l. The activity of cefpirome against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% MIC of 12.5 mg/l, was superior to piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime and cefoperazone. The 90% MIC against Staphylococcus aureus was 0.8 mg/l, but methicillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited. Cefpirome was not significantly hydrolyzed by most plasmid beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV-1, PSE, OXA) nor by chromosomal enzymes (P99, Branhamella catarrhalis, K1). Cefpirome did not inhibit chromosomal or plasmid beta-lactamases. Mice systemically infected with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were protected by concentrations of cefpirome ranging from 0.85 mg/kg for K. pneumoniae to 4.467 mg/kg for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Prostatic tissue levels of ceftizoxime].
AB  - The concentration of Ceftizoxime (CZX) was determined in the prostatic tissue and serum of 130 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. Two grams of CZX was given by intravenous injection prior to TUR. The mean value of CZX levels in prostatic tissue and prostatic level/serum levels ratio (p/s ratio) after administration were 47.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/g, 49.1% at 30 minutes, 33.3 +/- 2.2 micrograms/g, 51.4% at one hour, 22.2 +/- 2.7 micrograms/g, 60.8% at 2 hours, 13.6 +/- 3.9 micrograms/g, 64.2% at 4 hours, 3.04 +/- 0.54 micrograms/g, 74.5% at 8 hours, respectively. In conclusion, the concentration of CZX in the prostatic tissues attained the minimal inhibitory concentration of 80% for the gram-negative bacteria, the excluding P. aeruginosa. Thus clinical effectiveness of CZX could be expected on bacterial prostatitis and bacterial infection after prostatic operations.
TI  - [Possibilities of enhancing the sensitivity of the coagglutination reaction].
AB  - The influence of heating Shigella suspension at 60 degrees C (for 3 minutes) and  100 degrees C (for 30 minutes), as well as adding extraneous microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Proteus) and homologous antibodies to these suspensions, on the sensitivity of the coagglutination test has been studied. The possibility of enhancing the sensitivity of this test 10 to 100 times by heating Shigella suspensions at 100 degrees C for 30 minutes has been shown.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in urinary tract and prostatic infections].
AB  - Cefmenoxime, a new cephalosporin, was given to fifty patients (28 male and 22 female) aged 15 to 86 years with infection of the urinary tract or prostate. Urinary tract infections, i.e. cystitis in 20 cases and pyelonephritis in 21, were usually chronic and associated with urologic anomalies. Nine patients had infection of the prostate. Pathogens recovered from the urine were 26 E. coli, 8 Klebsiella, 16 Serratia, 5 Proteus mirabilis or indole-positive Proteus, 1 Providencia, and 4 Pseudomonas. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime ranged from 0.015 to 64 micrograms/ml (mean MIC: 0.12 micrograms/ml). Cefmenoxime was given as single drug therapy in all patients but one, in a daily dosage of 2 g divided into two intramuscular injections, for 3 to 28 days (average 22 days). Follow-up after discontinuation of treatment was four weeks. Therapeutic results were as follows: 13 successes and 7 failures by relapse for the 20 cystitis patients, 13 successes and 7 failures by relapse for the 20 interpretable cases of pyelonephritis, and 4 successes and 5 failures by relapse for the 9 patients with prostate infection. Local tolerance was excellent. Skin rash in 2 patients and diarrhea in 1 required withdrawal of the drug. Three other patients with diarrhea were able to continue treatment. Intolerance to ingestion of alcoholic beverages was reported by 10 patients. Hypereosinophilia was recorded in 2 cases and a transient mononucleosic reaction in one. No renal of hepatic side effects were documented.
TI  - Isolation of labeled lipoprotein from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis after incubation with [14C]penicillin.
AB  - [14C]penicillin binding experiments and membrane analysis were carried out with cell envelope preparations from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. After incubation with [14C]penicillin G labeled free lipoprotein could be identified. The analysis of the isolated lipoprotein by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that there is only one protein with an apparent molecular weight of 7000. The amino acid composition of isolated labeled free lipoprotein from E. coli was identical to the lipoprotein already found in E. coli. It is a point of interest that the amino acid composition of the isolated labeled free lipoprotein from P. mirabilis D 52 differs from that found in other mutants of this strain. The free form of lipoprotein from P. mirabilis D 52 is composed of 61 amino acids and has glycine, phenylalanine and proline as specific components.

AB  
TI  - Aztreonam in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host  defenses.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  aztreonam in hospital-acquired infections. Twenty patients (13 men and 7 women) with impaired host defenses and nosocomial infections were treated with aztreonam at a dosage ranging 4 and 6 g/day I.V. at 8 or 12-hour intervals. Average length of therapy was 10.35 +/- 4.61 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Proteus mirabilis (2), Proteus vulgaris (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Serratia marcescens (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (1). In 5 patients (25%) a mixed infection was observed. Sixteen patients (80%) were completely cured from infection and 24 isolated organisms (88.8%) were eradicated. No adverse reactions were observed. Aztreonam has undoubtedly high clinical and bacteriological efficacy in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host defenses.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Binding of polymyxin B nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled PMBN. Smooth Salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of PMBN per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 X 10(6) to 2 X 10(6) molecules of PMBN per single cell. The binding was of relatively high affinity (Kd, 1.3 microM). The isolated outer membrane of S. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of PMBN per mg of outer membrane protein (Kd, 1.1 microM), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. Other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of PMBN (Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of PMBN. The S. typhimurium pmrA mutant, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Proteus mirabilis (all known as resistant to polymyxin and PMBN) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than S. typhimurium, respectively. The binding of PMBN to S. typhimurium was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin B, compound EM49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. Spermine, Ca2+, and Mg2+ also inhibited the PMBN binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin B, respectively. No binding inhibition was found at the tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.
TI  - Norfloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the therapy of uncomplicated, community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - In a prospective, randomized trial, norfloxacin (400 mg perorally, twice a day) was compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160-800 mg perorally, twice a day) in 45 patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate. Infections due to Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were also treated. Norfloxacin was equivalent in effectiveness and safety to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with a cure rate of 91% at the 5- to 9-day posttherapy visit and 88% at the 4- to 6-week posttherapy visit. It was well tolerated and had a low incidence of side effects.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in American hospitals.
AB  - A total of 5,825,243 strains of bacteria were isolated in 242 American hospitals  during a period of twelve years (1971 to 1982). The susceptibility to antibiotics of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp. Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. did not change significantly during this period of time. The susceptibility to tetracycline for E. coli and S. aureus increased. Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed a decrease in susceptibility.

TI  - Comparison of the exoproducts of gram-negative bacteria by SDS-Page.
AB  - The protein exoproducts released during exponential growth of Gram-negative bacteria were analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-Page). The following bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia rubidaea, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella minnesota, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is demonstrated by SDS-Page that members of one species show identical protein pattern, whereas different species show besides comparable protein bands a species characteristic pattern. All members of Enterobacteriaceae were shown to release proteins whose molecular weights fell into the following size regions: Each strain was shown to synthesize a polypeptide of molecular weight 34,000 and one or more polypeptides within the molecular weight range 25,000-29,000. This profile was shown to be clearly different from that of Pseudomonas strains where 20 or more distinct polypeptides ranging from 12,500 to 160,000 Mr were detectable.
TI  - Isolation of altered recA polypeptides and interaction with ATP and DNA.
AB  - In this paper we describe the partial proteolytic digestion of recA proteins from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis and the production and isolation of truncated recA polypeptides. A proteolytic fragment of the P. mirabilis recA protein bound single-strand DNA and ATP normally but has altered duplex DNA binding properties. This protein was shown to initiate but not complete DNA strand transfer from a DNA duplex to a complementary single strand. The product of the E. coli recA1 allele bound but could not hydrolyze ATP and the protein bound single-strand but not double-strand DNA. This protein did not appear to initiate the transfer of a strand from a linear duplex to a single-strand circle and inhibited the wild-type recA protein from performing strand transfer. We report that recA protein binds linear duplex DNA in a manner that enhances the rate of ligation by T4 DNA ligase. When heterologous single-strand DNA was added in addition to the duplex DNA large stable aggregates of protein and DNA were formed that could easily be sedimented from solution.
TI  - Concrement formation in the urinary bladder in rats inoculated with Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - To study the concrement-forming ability of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the urinary  tract, viable and heat-killed ureaplasmas as well as urease and non-urease-producing bacteria were inoculated into the bladder in rats. Viable ureaplasmas, in contrast to heat-killed, caused the formation of bladder stones with a frequency corresponding to urease-producing bacteria (Proteus mirabilis). It was not possible to reculture the inoculated ureaplasmas from the urinary tract. Non-urease producing microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma hominis) only occasionally induced stone formation. The results indicate that U. urealyticum can initiate stone formation, a property that appears to be associated with the urease activity of the organism.
TI  - Detection of gram-negative bacteremia by limulus amebocyte lysate assay: evaluation in a rat model of peritonitis.
AB  - A spectrophotometric Limulus amebocyte lysate assay using lysis filtration and centrifugation has been developed for the detection of gram-negative bacteria in blood. The assay is directed at detection of endotoxin in viable and nonviable bacteria present in the blood-stream and not detection of free endotoxin in plasma. The assay was evaluated in a model of peritonitis in which rats were challenged with an inoculum consisting of sterilized human feces, barium sulfate, and one of eight species of bacteria. This assay was able to detect gram-negative bacteremia due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the rat model when compared with sham-inoculated uninfected rats. The assay failed to detect bacteremia due to Bacteroides fragilis or Staphylococcus aureus, nor was there a significant rise in absorbance when a pellet containing sterilized feces was implanted in the rat.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime against clinical isolates. Comparative study].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinically isolated organisms was examined in comparison with that of 4 other antibiotics and concluded as follows: Antibacterial activity of CMX was markedly stronger than those of cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole, latamoxef and ampicillin against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, H. influenzae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus. But the MIC level of CMX against S. aureus was higher than that of CEZ.
TI  - Pathogenesis of Escherichia coli cystitis and pyelonephritis: apparent lack of significance of bacterial motility and chemotaxis towards human urine.
AB  - All 45 microscopically motile urinary isolates tested here (37 Escherichia coli,  two Enterobacter cloacae, two Citrobacter freundii, three Proteus mirabilis and one Proteus morganii) were strongly attracted to fresh human urine in a capillary chemotaxis assay. This observation suggested that urine taxis of gram-negative bacteria promotes their invasion of the human lower urinary tract and their ascension to the kidney(s). However, the incidence of motile isolates and their activity in urine taxis assays were similar for fecal E. coli isolates, for isolates from patients with recurrent cystitis and from patients with presumed pyelonephritis (E. coli blood isolates with concomitant E. coli bacteriuria). Thus, the present study of E. coli did not support the hypothesis that bacterial motility is a virulence factor in urinary tract infection.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - Structural studies on the lipid A component of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides by laser desorption mass spectrometry. Location of acyl groups at the lipid A backbone.
AB  - In the present paper laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) was applied to dephosphorylated free lipid A preparations obtained from lipopolysaccharides of Re mutants of Salmonella minnesota, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the location of (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid and 3-O-acylated (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues which are bound to amino and hydroxyl groups of the glucosamine disaccharide backbone of lipid A. Based on the previous finding from biochemical analyses that the amino group of the nonreducing glucosamine residue (GlcN II) of the backbone carries, in S. minnesota and E. coli, 3-dodecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid and, in P. mirabilis, 3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid, a self-consistent interpretation of the LDMS was possible. It was found that: (a) in all three lipids A GlcN II is, besides the amide-linked 3-acyloxyacyl residue, substituted by ester-linked 3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid; (b) the reducing glucosamine (GlcN I) is substituted by ester-linked 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid; (c) the amino group of GlcN I carries a 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid which is non-acylated in E. coli and which is partially acylated by hexadecanoic acid in S. minnesota and P. mirabilis. In lipids A which were obtained from the P. mirabilis Re mutant grown at low temperature (12 degrees C) LDMS analysis revealed that specifically the one fatty acid bound to the 3-hydroxyl group of amide-linked 3-hydroxytetra-decanoic acid at GlcN II is positionally replaced by delta 9-hexadecenoic acid (palmitoleic acid). It appears, therefore, that enterobacterial lipids A resemble each other in that the 3-hydroxyl groups of the two 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues linked to GlcN II are fully acylated, while those of the two 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid groups attached to GlcN I are free or only partially substituted.
TI  - Alpha-2----4-interlinked 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid disaccharide. A common  constituent of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - After mild acid hydrolysis, a disaccharide of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (dOclA) was obtained from Re-mutant lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella minnesota, Salmonella godesberg, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli, and from the lipopolysaccharide of an S. minnesota Rb2 mutant. Combined gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of the reduced and permethylated derivatives indicated that the disaccharide is interlinked by a 2----4-glycosidic bond in all lipopolysaccharides tested. In addition, it was shown by gas-liquid chromatography of appropriate synthetic standards and a previously characterized alpha 2----4-linked dOclA disaccharide (derived from lipopolysaccharide of S. godesberg) that the non-reducing dOclA residue possesses the alpha configuration. In the case of lipopolysaccharide of S. minnesota Rb2 mutant, this result, together with earlier findings, suggests that it contains a linear dOclA trisaccharide of the sequence dOclA(alpha 2-4)dOclA. The results show that a dOclA(alpha 2-4)dOclA disaccharide represents a common architectural principle in enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides.
TI  - An evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980RP).
AB  - Ceftiolene (42980RP) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. The affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for Escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight PBPs of E. coli. Enterobacter cloacae. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The affinity of ceftiolene for PBP1 of Staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for PBP3. The bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against Gram-negative organisms was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. Introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into E. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. Chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene- or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. Growth of Staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. These observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine MIC determinations to distinguish between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.
TI  - Sex differences in urinary tract infection in children.
AB  
TI  - In vitro effect of pH and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of  norfloxacin in urine.
AB  - The in vitro effect of pH and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was studied. Norfloxacin effectively inhibited the growth of four gram-negative pathogens in urine in vitro at pH values of 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. The antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was reduced severalfold at pH 6, but minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at this pH remained clinically significant. Glucose at concentrations of 200 mg/dl and 400 mg/dl (simulating glucosuria of diabetes) did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin when tested against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Norfloxacin appears to be a highly effective antibiotic in vitro under conditions which simulate normal and diabetic states.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin in experimentally-infected normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.
AB  - Systemic bacterial infections due to Escherichia coli MB 2884, Proteus mirabilis  MB 3125 and Klebsiella pneumoniae MB 4005 were well controlled by treatment with norfloxacin both in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. similar observations were made when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used against susceptible pathogens. Systemic infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa MB 4700 was well controlled by norfloxacin and gentamicin in normal mice; this infection was more refractory to treatment by both drugs in diabetic animals. These observations suggest that norfloxacin may be an effective drug in the treatment of bacterial infections which may occur under diabetic conditions, and further investigation is warranted.
TI  - The use of penicillins in orthopaedic surgery.
AB  - The main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group D streptococci (enterococci). Penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. The tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. Semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - In vitro synthesis of peptidoglycan by spheroplasts of Proteus mirabilis grown in the presence of penicillin.
AB  - Spheroplasts of the unstable L-form of Proteus mirabilis with fragile, shape defective cell walls grown in medium containing 120 mg/l penicillin G and then killed and permeabilized by ether treatment, were capable of in vitro synthesis of peptidoglycan from the precursors UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu(ms-A2pm-D-Ala-D-Ala). The in vitro peptidoglycan was extensively peptide-crosslinked, indicating a continuing function of peptidoglycan transpeptidase in the spheroplasts. The seven penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of P. mirabilis with their functions as multiple peptidoglycan transpeptidases were shown to be saturated in the spheroplasts and thereby functionally inactivated by the penicillin of the growth medium to a very different degree. Complete or almost complete saturation occurred with the PBPs 1A, 1B, and 3, for which functions as indispensable transpeptidases in Escherichia coli have been postulated. In contrast, PBPs 5 and 6 were not saturated in the L-form spheroplasts. Transpeptidase function has been described previously in PBP 5 of P. mirabilis. The working hypothesis is proposed that synthesis of the functionally defective peptidoglycan of L-form spheroplasts in the presence of penicillin takes place with transpeptidase function of PBP 5.
TI  - Abscess induction in beige (bg/bg) mutant mice.
AB  - Humans with Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) and several animal species with similar defects have been reported to have increased susceptibility to infection, including abscess formation, associated with granulocyte abnormalities. These defects were investigated by comparing mice of the SB/Le strain, homozygous for the beige mutation, with their heterozygous littermates and with normal BALB/c mice with respect to the ability to form intraabdominal abscesses. Mice were autopsied 7 days after the intraperitoneal inoculation of a mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. Although homozygous beige mice formed more numerous abscesses than controls, the total abscess sizes and bacterial contents were not significantly different. Histopathologically, the abscesses resembled those in normal mice. Phagocytic killing assays using granulocytes from beige mice of the SB/Le and C57BL/6J strains showed no significant differences between homozygous beige mice and controls. Within the context of these experiments in which neutrophil function in vivo and in vitro was examined with respect to anaerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacteria, it is concluded that beige mice can respond adequately to an infectious bacterial challenge. The increased susceptibility to an infection seen in various species with CHS-like disease may relate to virulence factors of the infecting organisms and defects in host defences documented by others but not manifest in these experiments.
TI  - Recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from irradiated mice.
AB  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were often found as mixed infections in 225 lethally irradiated mice. Of a total of 57 mice that were sacrificed, aerobic bacteria were recovered exclusively in 9 (27%) of the 34 culture-positive mice, anaerobic bacteria were recovered exclusively in 15 (44%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were recovered in 10 (29%). The predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus spp., and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Ureaplasma urealyticum-induced crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium phosphates in synthetic urine.
AB  - Crystallization of struvite and calcium phosphates was studied in vitro as encrustations on glass rods immersed in synthetic urine, to evaluate the crystallization capacity of Ureaplasma urealyticum and compare it with that of known urease and non-urease-producing bacteria. Inoculation of the synthetic urine with Ureaplasma urealyticum resulted in alkalinization of the synthetic urine and crystallization of struvite and brushite. Inoculation with Proteus mirabilis caused a faster and more pronounced alkalinization as well as crystallization of struvite and apatite. The alkalinization and crystallization caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum and Proteus mirabilis was completely prevented by acetohydroxamic acid, a potent urease inhibitor, linking the crystallization to the urease activity of the microorganisms. When the synthetic urine was inoculated with urease-negative Escherichia coli no alkalinization and no crystallization were seen.
TI  - Survey of the phenotypes of susceptibility to beta-lactams in Enterobacteriaceae  at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital.
AB  - The phenotypes of susceptibility to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin and cefotaxime were determined by the disc-diffusion method in 10,994 Enterobacteriaceae consecutively isolated from in-patients during 18 months. The susceptible phenotypes were much more frequent among Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella (67.4 to 84.8%) than among Serratia, Enterobacter and Citrobacter (8.8 to 35.5%). In all species the most common resistance phenotypes were to ampicillin and carbenicillin: E. coli (28%), Pr. mirabilis (15.2%), Klebsiella (23.8%), indole-positive Proteus (33.3%), Serratia (74.4%), Enterobacter (61.4%) and Citrobacter (74.8%). Among E. coli 4.6% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin but susceptible to carbenicillin. Among E. coli, Pr. mirabilis and Klebsiella the strains susceptible only to cefotaxime represented 0.3 to 5% and no cefotaxime-resistant strain was isolated; whereas among Serratia, Enterobacter and Citrobacter the former represented 28.3 to 58.3% and the latter 7.5 to 18.5%. Some important differences in the distribution of the phenotypes according to the type of ward were observed.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase induced by choline and its metabolic derivatives may contain a similar anionic peripheral site.
AB  - Different compounds derived from choline, and obtained by demethylation or by oxidation of the primary alcohol group with subsequent N-demethylation, were tested as inducer agents of acid phosphatase and cholinesterase in Ps. aeruginosa. It was found that betaine and dimethylglycine were the most effective inducers of both enzyme activities. These metabolites including choline itself, were not inducers of acid phosphatase and cholinesterase in other Gram-negative bacteria such as: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter liquefacciens and Proteus mirabilis. The acid phosphatase activities found in these bacteria were not inhibited in vitro by choline, betaine and phosphorylcholine. From these results it may be concluded that the acid phosphatase activity from Ps. aeruginosa is different from the same activity observed in the other bacteria. In addition, it is also shown that Ps. aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase were inhibited by a number of compounds containing a positively charged amino group, with methyl or ethyl groups bound to it. These results seem to confirm that Ps. aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase may contain a similar anionic site.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adhesion and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function with gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubation of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae with subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adherence and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against these organisms was studied. Culturing the above organisms in the presence of cefotaxime (1/4 MIC) resulted in reduced adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Furthermore pre-incubation of all organisms with sub MICs of cefotaxime resulted in significant enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against these organisms.
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.
TI  - Effect of ammonium on bacterial adherence to bladder transitional epithelium.
AB  - The virulence of urease-producing bacteria depends on the ability of urease to degrade urea into ammonia and thereby to alkalinize the urine. Infections caused by urease-producing organisms such as Proteus mirabilis are particularly difficult to manage clinically. We have shown that the layer of glycosaminoglycans at the bladder surface protects against infection by blocking the adherence of bacteria to the epithelium. To determine whether urease-producing urinary pathogens owe their virulence in part to an ability to inactivate the protective effect of the glycosaminoglycan layer, we tested the ability of ammonium chloride to alter bacterial adherence to the normal vesical mucosa. We used an in vivo adherence assay that we have described previously in rabbits. Control animals received sodium chloride adjusted to the same pH as the ammonium chloride. We found that 0.25 M ammonium chloride significantly increases bacterial adherence to normal vesical mucosa as compared to adherence in controls receiving 0.25 M sodium chloride (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that urease plays a hitherto undescribed role in bacterial virulence by altering the antiadherence activity of the glycosaminoglycan layer present at the transitional cell surface.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Canine urinary tract infections: a comparison of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results and response to oral therapy with ampicillin or with trimethoprim-sulfa.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of ampicillin therapy in all 56 urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and S intermedius), in all 26 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 38 of 44 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 29 of 31 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 8 of 10 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and in 16 of 20 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 173 of 187 (92.5%) isolates responded to ampicillin therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results. In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of therapy with trimethoprim-sulfa in 119 of 138 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 33 of 45 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, in 38 of 43 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 21 of 25 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 9 of 11 UTI caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci, and in 19 of 21 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 239 of 283 (84%) isolates responded to trimethoprim-sulfa therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - Transition of deletion mutants of the composite resistance plasmid NR1 in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Derivatives of the composite R plasmid NR1 from which a portion of the resistance determinants (r-determinants) component had been deleted were found to undergo amplification of the remaining r-determinants region in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The wild-type NR1 plasmid does not amplify in these genera, although all of these plasmids undergo amplification in Proteus mirabilis. The deletion mutants retained the mercuric ion resistance operon (mer) but conferred a much lower level of sulfonamide resistance than NR1. The remaining r-determinants region, which is bounded by direct repeats of the insertion element IS1, formed multiple tandem duplications in E. coli, S. typhimurium, and P. mirabilis after subculturing the host cells in medium containing high concentrations of sulfonamide. Gene amplification was characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis, analytical buoyant density centrifugation, DNA-DNA hybridization, and sedimentation in sucrose gradients. The tandem repeats remained attached to the resistance transfer factor component of the plasmid in at least part of the plasmid population; autonomous tandem repeats of r-determinants were probably also present. Amplification did not occur in host recA mutants. Amplified strains subcultured in drug-free medium lost the amplified r-determinants. By using a strain temperature sensitive for the recA gene, it was possible to obtain gene amplification at the permissive temperature. Loss of r-determinants took place at the permissive temperature, but not at the nonpermissive temperature. The termini of the deletions of several independent mutants which conferred low sulfonamide resistance were found to be located within the adjacent streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance gene.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivities of urinary pathogens, 1971-82.
AB  - All urinary pathogens from general practice and from hospital have been tested for sensitivity to a range of antimicrobial drugs for the last 12 years. During that period there have been marked changes. In general practice there has been a marked increase in the proportion of staphylococcal infections, from 5.1% to 14.8%, and a noticeable decrease in the proportion caused by Proteus mirabilis, from 9.2% to 4.1%. Similar, but smaller, changes have been seen in the proportions of hospital UTI caused by those organisms, while the proportion of hospital infections due to Klebsiella-Enterobacter spp. has fallen from 16.8% to 8.3%. These, and other, changes have been reflected in changing antibiotic sensitivity patterns. In particular, sensitivity of urinary pathogens to ampicillin/amoxycillin and to cephaloridine has continued to fall both in general practice and in hospital. In general practice UTI nalidixic acid-resistance is becoming more important as the proportion of Gram-positive urinary pathogens increases. There has been little change in sensitivity to trimethoprim or co-trimoxazole over the last 12 years.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - Aminoglycoside resistance among blood culture isolates.
AB  - A total of 633 blood culture isolates were collected from 1981 to 1982 from seven major Finnish hospitals, including all university central hospitals. Susceptibility of the strains to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and netilmicin was determined by the Sensititre microtiter procedure. Resistance against any of these agents occurred in 1.3 to 6.5% of all strains studied. In the Turku University Central Hospital, an increased number of tobramycin- and gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were found; the frequency of strains resistant to tobramycin was 57% and to gentamicin was 29% versus frequencies of 16 and 18%, respectively, which were observed in the other hospitals. An explanation for this might be a change in the use of aminoglycosides in the Turku University Central Hospital; within 3 years, 1979 to 1981, the consumption of tobramycin and amikacin had increased 330 and 290%, respectively, whereas the use of gentamicin had decreased to 24% of that in the beginning of the period. Resistance against tobramycin was mediated by enzymes APH(2")-AAC(6') and ANT(4').
TI  - [Isolation and characteristics of a temperature-sensitive plasmid pRP19.6--an RP1 derivative containing the duplicated IS21 sequence].
AB  - When analysing the antibiotic resistant, temperature-independent derivatives of Proteus mirabilis cells, carrying the plasmid RP1ts12, a derivative of the latter (pRP19.6) with an elevated frequency of integration into E. coli K12 chromosome, has been isolated. The structure and properties of pRP19.6 was studied. As revealed from the data of structural and genetic analyses pRP19.6 is identical to the factor R68.45 described earlier by Haas and Holloway. Similarly to R68.45, the plasmid under study contains two copies of IS21 sequence and mobilises nonconjugative plasmid pBR325 with high efficiency. Using the temperature sensitive replication of pRP19.6, frequency of it's integration into the chromosomes of E. coli rec+ and recA- stains is determined. It is demonstrated that the clones carrying the plasmid in integrated state are Hfr-strains. The possibilities to use the temperature sensitive R68.45 like plasmid for isolation of Hfr-strains in the broad range of gram-negative bacteria and for insertional inactivation of chromosomal genes are discussed.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of azlocillin and carbenicillin against 856 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - Eight hundred and fifty-six strains of more than ten species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp and Acinetobacter spp, were tested by the disc diffusion method against azlocillin and carbenicillin. Azlocillin was found to be superior to carbenicillin against Pseudomonas spp, and more than 90% of the tested strains had minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values well below the serum levels attainable after recommended doses of azlocillin. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive cocci, however, azlocillin seemed to have little to offer.
TI  - [Concept of class in relation to first-generation cephalosporins].
AB  - The authors consider differences in answer of the first generation cephalosporins against several strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and suggest a revision of the "class" concept as regards sensitivity response of the above mentioned cephalosporins.
TI  - Synergistic effect of bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, anaerobic cocci, and aerobic bacteria on mortality and induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice.
AB  - The potential for synergy between aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria was studied by subcutaneous inoculation of mixtures of these organisms into mice and observation of subsequent mortality and abscess formation. The anaerobic bacteria tested included 12 strains of gram-positive cocci and two strains each of Bacteroides species, Clostridium species, and Fusobacterium species. The facultative and aerobic bacteria included one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Mortality increased significantly when each aerobic organism was inoculated along with either of the Bacteroides species. A similar increase occurred when the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were inoculated along with P. aeruginosa (four of six combinations) or S. aureus (four of six). The rate of abscess induction increased significantly when 10 of the 12 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci were injected along with B. fragilis and when nine of these strains were inoculated along with Bacteroides asaccharolyticus . The results demonstrate synergistic potential between Bacteroides species and all aerobic bacteria tested, between Bacteroides species and most anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and between most anaerobic gram-positive cocci and P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - Ceftazidime concentrations in human aqueous humor.
AB  - Two grams of ceftazidime was given to 25 patients before cataract surgery. Mean aqueous humor concentrations of 2.8, 3.2, 3.39, and 1.94 micrograms/mL were observed 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours, respectively, after administration of the drug. These concentrations are many times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftazidime against 90% ( MIC90 ) of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Proteus mirabilis, and indole-positive Proteus sp. The peak aqueous humor level was also equivalent to or slightly higher than the MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. The susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. The strains included representatives of Escherichia coli with different O- and K-antigens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Salmonella typhimurium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. In contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin B nonapeptide.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Volatile products from acetylcholine as markers in the rapid urine test using head-space gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Head-space gas--liquid chromatographic analyses of cultures of all Proteus spp. showed that the production of trimethylamine from acetylcholine could be the marker for the detection in 3.5 h of significant numbers of P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans A in the rapid test for Escherichia and Klebsiella spp. in urine specimens. Trimethylamine was not detected in cultures of five other urinary pathogens. Six of fifteen strains of K. aerogenes produced trimethylamine from acetylcholine but were distinguished from Proteus spp. by ethanol production from arabinose. Ethyl acetate was produced from acetylcholine by P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, P. inconstans A, P. inconstans B, E. coli, K. aerogenes and Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Aztreonam versus cefamandole in the treatment of urinary tract infections.
AB  - The in vivo efficacy and safety of aztreonam compared to that of cefamandole was  randomly and prospectively studied in the treatment of 30 patients suffering from recurrent urinary tract infections with a patient ratio of 2 aztreonam to 1 cefamandole. The mean age was 51.6 +/- 15.4 and 59.8 +/- 13 years respectively. Both antibiotics were given at a dose of 1 g, 8 hourly i.m. for 7-13 days. Sixty-seven percent versus 70% of the patients given aztreonam and cefamandole respectively were suffering from upper urinary tract infections. X ray abnormalities predisposing to relapse or reinfections were present in 88% vs 80% of the patients, while all patients had typical symptoms of urinary tract infections, with high fever (greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C) reported in 70% and 60% of the patients in the two treatment groups respectively. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were the predominant isolates in urine cultures. During treatment all patients responded favourably both clinically and bacteriologically, while after a 6-week follow-up 20% versus 30% relapsed clinically with 15% vs 30% bacteriologic relapses in the two groups, but only in patients suffering from upper urinary tract infections. No development of bacterial resistance was observed in the relapses, while mainly Enterococcus spp was implicated in reinfections. No appreciable side effects of toxicity were observed. It was concluded that aztreonam is a promising new antibiotic that deserves further clinical trials in systemic infections.
TI  - The uptake and utilization of Entodinium caudatum, bacteria, free amino acids and glucose by the rumen ciliate Entodinium bursa.
AB  - Washed suspensions of Entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with Entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. The rate of uptake and digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. Protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf Proteus mirabilis or Klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up Bacillus megaterium. Selenomonas ruminantium, Torulopsis glabrata and Streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. Protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up Megasphaera elsdenii and Proteus mirabilis most rapidly. Individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the B. megaterium, Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis taken up. Labelled Ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by Ent. bursa. Some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from Ent. caudatum protein to Ent. bursa protein. Engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. Free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. When available for engulfment Ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by Ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.
TI  - Pivmecillinam for bacteriuria in pregnancy.
AB  - Pivmecillinam was given to 44 women with bacteriuria in pregnancy. Treatment was  successful in 33 (87%) out of the 38 patients assessed. Thirty women subsequently received at random either a low-dose of pivmecillinam for up to three months or acted as a control group. Further bacteriuric episodes during pregnancy were recorded only in three patients in the control group. Thirty-nine out of the 41 women followed to term delivered healthy babies. One infant was stillborn and another child had a cleft palate. Neither was considered to be related to treatment with pivmecillinam.
TI  - [Some components of preputial bacterial flora in the ram].
AB  - During the reproductive period the AA have carried on bacteriological researches  in the preputial cavity in eight sardinian rams, without pathological processes, living in eight flocks in the country around Sassari, in order to detect the bacteriological flora. This flora could interfere both with fertility and with conservation of seminal material for artificial insemination. Three withdrawals have been carried on before, during and after the reproduction season. E.coli, P. mirabilis, Staph. epidermidis have been found in the varius examined subjects. The AA stress that the same bacterium which had been isolated in the first withdrawal. Moreover in some subjects the bacteriological flora had increased. The AA stress how these data can be useful in order to control the flock fertility and in order to improve the technology of conservation of seminal material.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - A comparison of the Api-10M commercial microdilution system with the tube dilution and standard microdilution methods.
AB  - The susceptibilities of urinary isolates of Escherichia coli (50 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15 strains) and Proteus mirabilis (15 strains) to gentamicin and ampicillin were determined and compared using the following methods: standard tube dilution, standard microdilution, commercial microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests. Results of susceptibility testing performed with the Api- 10M commercial microdilution method agreed with those of the tube dilution method in 93% of the tests, but in only 70% of those obtained with the standard microdilution method; tube dilution and standard microdilution agreed in 85.6% of the cases. All three methods of MIC susceptibility testing agreed with the disk diffusion method in 100% of the tests. There was a definite tendency for the Api- 10M system to give higher MICs than the tube dilution method; the standard microdilution method tended to give lower MICs than those obtained by tube dilution and the commercial microdilution system. The Api- 10M system is a reliable, simple and accurate method since it correlates very will with the tube dilution method.
TI  - Ceforanide compared with cefazolin in skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - The response of serious skin and skin structure infections to ceforanide 1 gm every twelve hours or cefazolin 1 gm every eight hours was evaluated in ninety-six patients hospitalized for treatment. Most of the patients had decubitus ulcers; predominant pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. Ceforanide produced a satisfactory clinical response in 89 percent (forty-eight of fifty-four) of the patients evaluated and eradicated 90 percent (seventy-four of eighty-two) of the pathogens. Although the clinical response of forty-two cefazolin-treated patients was similar (satisfactory response in 86 percent, thirty-six patients), only 81 percent (forty-eight of fifty-nine) of the pathogens were eradicated. Both ceforanide and cefazolin were very well tolerated systemically and locally.
TI  - Vero cell invasiveness of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Vero cell invasiveness was studied for a group of Proteus mirabilis strains isolated from the urinary tract and feces and for a limited group of urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. Experimental conditions affecting this invasiveness were studied. All of the P. mirabilis strains tested were capable of cell invasion, whereas none of the E. coli strains was. Correlation between the hemolytic activity of the P. mirabilis strains and their invasive ability suggested that the bacterial hemolysin may be involved in the invasion process. Other experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is discussed. The differences in the invasive capacities of P. mirabilis and of E. coli may be important for the apparent differences in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection by both species.
TI  - Effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.
AB  - Two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and gentamicin. When the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the MICs of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-A streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the MIC of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. With Staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the MICs of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the MICs of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. The effect of saliva on the susceptibility of E. coli to tetracycline was also significant; MIC50 and MIC90 were reduced from 128 to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. Chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when E. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. The general significance of these observations is discussed.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil against clinical isolates of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared by agar dilution method. All drugs had comparable antistaphylococcal activity. Cefatrizine and cefaclor were more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. All four drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of Enterobacter species and indole-positive Proteus. However, cefatrizine demonstrated the greatest activity of the four oral cephems against these organisms. None of these oral cephems was active against Serratia marcescens or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Use of the Autobac IDX system for rapid identification of Enterobacteriaceae and  nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The Autobac IDX system was evaluated for its ability to accurately identify 290 gram-negative bacilli from 18 different genera. Excluding isolates with a low identification probability, the overall sensitivity of the system was found to be 95.8%. Late lactose-fermenting Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus mirabilis accounted for over 90% of the misidentifications. The Autobac IDX system offers a rapid and reliable method for the identification of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of eight new beta-lactam compounds against cephalothin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from hospital patients.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of eight newer beta-lactam antibiotics (mecillinam, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) was determined against 87 cephalothin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated during 6 months in a general hospital. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, moxalactam and ceftazidime proved to be highly active; only a minority of strains required higher concentrations than 0.125 microgram/ml for inhibition of growth. Cefoxitin, mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin were less active. Mecillinam displayed greater efficacy against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp., while the same was the case for piperacillin against Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, and for cefoxitin against indole-positive Proteus spp. The production of beta-lactamase was correlated with a reduced activity of mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin but not of cefoxitin or the other beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins. However, some strains, mainly those of Proteus, Enterobacter and Serratia, though resistant to mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin did not produce beta-lactamases. This observation might indicate that ceftriaxone, moxalactam, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, besides their indifference to beta-lactamases, are characterized also by a high degree of intrinsic activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of FK 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  - FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Determination of surface charge of some bacteria by colloid titration.
AB  - The surface charge of bacteria is always negative except below pH 2. The negative charge depends mainly upon phosphate and carboxyl groups. The charge of six kinds of bacteria was determined by colloid titration between pH 2 and 11. When there is amino group on the cell surface, it is positive as ammonium cation between pH 2 and 10, and it combines with the negative groups to neutralize the negative charge. In the presence of formalin, the colloid titration results show that the free amine is blocked by formalin, and the amino group can be estimated by the difference between the two titration results. Above pH 10, the titration results of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi in the presence of formalin implied the existence of guanidyl group. The titration results of living bacterial suspensions were quite the same as those of heat-killed ones.
TI  - Anomalous expression of the E. coli lac operon in Proteus mirabilis. II. Effects  of lacI and lacP mutations.
AB  - The lac operon introduced into Proteus mirabilis shows two anomalies of expression: the maximal induced level is reduced by about an order of magnitude, and the basal level becomes about 100 times higher than in E. coli, as a result of which the induction ratio appears very small, around 2-5 in contrast to as much as 1000 in E. coli. It was suggested by Baumberg and Dennison (1975) that the two anomalies might be manifestations of a single effect whereby some exogenous promoters give poor expression in this host, since they could result from poor expression of the lacZYA and lacI promoters respectively. We show here that when the lacP class II promoter mutation L305 was transferred on an F-prime into P. mirabilis, its effect on lac expression was much as in E. coli. However, when Flac bearing the IQ1 up-promoter mutation was introduced into P. mirabilis, the basal level decreased by three orders of magnitude, in accord with poor expression of lacI+ being responsible for the usual low induction ratio. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of Baumberg and Dennison (1975) but do not prove it: poor expression of lacI and/or lacZYA could also result from weak translation initiation, problems of continuation of transcription or translation (e.g. due to pause sequences or differences in codon use), or diminished mRNA stability.
TI  - Anomalous expression of the E. coli lac operon in Proteus mirabilis. I. Effects of L8 and L8 UV5.
AB  - The lac operon shows anomalous expression in Proteus mirabilis: the maximal induced level is 10% or less of that in E. coli, while repression reduces this by a factor of only 2-5. We have sought to determine whether this effect relates in any way to CRP-mediated activation of expression, by comparing expression in P. mirabilis of lac operons (introduced for technical reasons on IncP1 plasmids) either regulatorily wild-type or bearing L8 or L8UV5. Derivatives of RP1 bearing L8UV5 were obtained by homogenotisation of pGC9114 (RP1::Tn951) in a L8UV5 background; while derivatives of RP4 bearing lac+, L8 or L8UV5 were obtained by Mu-mediated translocation of chromosomal regions bearing these alleles, following partial heat-induction of Mucts62 on pGM14 (RP4::Mucts62) in the appropriate hosts. These plasmids could be readily transferred to, and stably maintained in, the P. mirabilis strains employed. It was found that L8 reduced the maximal level of beta-galactosidase activity, and L8UV5 restored this activity to around wild-type, in P. mirabilis quantitatively very much as in E. coli. Nevertheless, the low maximal level of expression and high basal level characteristic of the former host were unchanged. The simplest explanation of these results is that P. mirabilis contains a protein that mimics the E. coli CRP protein in interacting with the appropriate DNA binding site and thereby stimulating transcription; and that the anomalous regulation of lac in this host is unconnected with the CRP system.
TI  - Do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  - We examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (Ig). For this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with Ig preparations. These were obtained from infected urine either by removal of Ig from ACB (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 M glycine-HCl, or 3 M NaSCN) or by staphylococcal protein A affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. Coincubation of either Ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, several Escherichia coli strains, enterococci, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with Ig. Coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. Adsorption of Ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. Coating was observed both with intact IgG and with F(ab)2 fragments. We further examined the proportion of bacteria coated with IgA, IgG, and IgM in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. The frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. Consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. It is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with Ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. A major problem of the ACB test is definition of the normal range.
TI  - The effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  - Previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. Removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. Exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore Escherichia coli adherence to control levels. To determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozonae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. Bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3H-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Results were as follows: Acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. Briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except Pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. Heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except Pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. The magnitude of Klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. While this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against Pseudomonas.

TI  - Functional substitution of the recE gene of Bacillus subtilis by the recA gene of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Rec mutants of Bacillus subtilis have been tested for complementation by the recA gene of Proteus mirabilis (recApm) which was introduced into B. subtilis via the plasmid pHP334. In the recE4 mutant of B. subtilis the plasmid pHP334 restored significantly the defects in RecE functions tested: UV-sensitivity, homologous recombination (transduction and transformation) and prophage induction. Although serological methods to detect the presence of RecApm protein in B. subtilis have been unsuccessful, our results strongly indicate that the recE function of B. subtilis is analogous to the recA function of P. mirabilis.
TI  - Endotoxemia induced by antibiotic therapy: a mechanism for adrenal corticosteroid protection in gram-negative sepsis.
AB  - The following have been demonstrated: With a standardized model of P. mirabilis peritonitis in ICR mice, when optimal doses of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin) are given so as to reduce mortality maximally, abrupt and significant increments occur in endotoxemia, which cannot be attributed to impairment of clearance of endotoxin. Within the antibiotic-treated groups, these increments in endotoxemia correlate with mortality. The level of endotoxemia in the antibiotic-treated survivors is significantly greater than in animals dying without antibiotic therapy. MP, although unable to reduce mortality from P. mirabilis peritonitis in the absence of antibiotic therapy, does so when endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum. It is concluded from these observations that aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment can shift the lethal mechanisms during P. mirabilis peritonitis from those involving bacterial proliferation and low levels of endotoxemia to those involving bacterial death and release of large amounts of endotoxin. It is postulated that this shift in lethal mechanisms could account for the ability of MP to reduce mortality when used in conjunction with antibiotics. Finally, since animals surviving after antibiotic treatment have significantly greater endotoxemia than those dying without such treatment and since MP does not reduce mortality in the absence of antibiotic therapy but does so if endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum, it appears that endotoxin may not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mortality from untreated P. mirabilis peritonitis. Whether the present correlation observed between the significant rises in endotoxemia produced by antibiotics and the protection afforded by MP extends to other models of gram-negative sepsis, or to human gram-negative sepsis, is under study.
TI  - Pathogenic synergy: mixed intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - In this article we review our researches into the pathogenesis of mixed infections. These may conveniently be divided into in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro we confirmed that interference with the killing of aerobes by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN's) is a property of the Bacteroides strains tested and appears to depend on competition for opsonins i.e. complement factors. Further studies are in progress to define which complement factors and which bacterial structures are involved. The influence of B. fragilis on chemotaxis has also been studied. Our preliminary data suggest that B. fragilis is itself poorly chemotactic and reduces the chemoattractivity of Proteus mirabilis. This observation is surprising when we consider that abscess formation is the hall-mark of B. fragilis infections and needs clarification. In vivo we have developed a skin infection model in mice which is economical and gives reproducible and quantitative results. In this model we have demonstrated pathogenic synergy between Escherichia coli and B. fragilis. Further studies are planned to assess the role of complement and bacterial factors in this in vivo synergy.
TI  - P. mirabilis RecA protein catalyses cleavage of E. coli LexA protein and the lambda repressor in vitro.
AB  - The cloned recA+ gene of proteus mirabilis substitutes for a defective RecA protein in Escherichia coli recA- mutants, and restores recombination, repair and phage induction functions to near normal levels. In a previous report, we described the purification and characterisation of the recombination activities of the P. mirabilis RecA protein (West et al. 1983b ). In this paper, we show that the purified protein catalyses the cleavage of both the Escherichia coli LexA protein and the bacteriophage lambda repressor in vitro. These results provide a direct biochemical basis for the interspecies complementation observed in vivo and suggest that P. mirabilis has an SOS regulatory network similar to that of E. coli.
TI  - Bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tracts of rats receiving thermal injury.
AB  - Rats receiving nonlethal thermal burns over 20 or 40% of their total body surface area were tested at various intervals for the translocation of indigenous bacteria from their gastrointestinal tracts to their mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal cavities, and bloodstreams. No indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control rats or from rats receiving 20% burns. However, 44% of the rats receiving 40% burns exhibited viable Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus sp. and Clostridium sp. in their mesenteric lymph nodes 2 days after thermal injury. Bacterial translocation after burn stress also was tested in antibiotic-decontaminated rats monoassociated with E. coli. E. coli attained population levels in these animals of 10(8) to 10(9) per g cecum. E. coli translocated to 100% of the mesenteric lymph nodes of both the control and 40% burned rats. However, E. coli translocated at a greater incidence to the spleens, livers, and peritoneal cavities of the burned rats compared with translocation to these organs in control rats. The numbers of E. coli translocating to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, and livers also were greater in the 40% burned rats than in control rats. By 14 days after thermal injury, the rats were able to clear E. coli from their spleens and livers, and the infection remained localized in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These results support the concept that the indigenous gastrointestinal flora or exogenous organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract are potential sources of septicemia after thermal injury.

TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Evidence for clustering of RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein genes in six species of Enterobacteria.
AB  - 32P-labelled DNA fragments from the E. coli beta operon were used as hybridisation probes for homologous DNA sequences in chromosomal digests of six species of Enterobacteria. In all species the hybridisation pattern suggested clustering of the genes comprising the beta operon.
TI  - [Chemobiotic sensitivity of common Gram-negative bacteria in urinary tract infections, 1981-1982].
AB  - 751 stems of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from urinary samples with bacterial  charge greater than or equal to 100,000 CFU (Colony Forming Units)/ml gathered from January 1981 to December 1982 have been examined. The sensitivity to the following chemoantibiotics has been tested: ampicillin, cefuroxime, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole. A very good sensitivity to pipemidic acid, amikacin, from all species considered (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, gr. Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas) and a good sensitivity to co-trimoxazole (with the exception of Pseudomonas) have been found. A decidedly low sensitivity has been found to nitrofurantoin and ampicillin from all species considered. It is also pointed out how the stems isolated in hospital patients are more resistant (with statistical significance by analysis of variance) than the corresponding species isolated in ambulatory patients.
TI  - [In vitro interaction between an ampicillin-colistin combination and ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli].
AB  - In this work, the authors studied in vitro potential interactions between bacteria and antibiotics. Colistin and ampicillin were introduced to ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli and ampicillin activity was measured. Two layers of agar media were used. The lower layer contained E. coli and colistin. The superficial layer was sown with indicating bacteria (ampicillin-sensitive Proteus mirabilis). Ampicillin activity was evaluated on the upper layer with impregnated disks. By this technique, it was ascertained that ampicillin degradation increased with colistin concentration. In this case, colistin may favour interactions of intracellular beta-lactamases on ampicillin.

AB  - Sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase was purified approximately 500- to 600-fold to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli C, Escherichia coli var. communior, Escherichia acidilactici, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, and Saccharomyces cereviseae. The molecular weights of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration ranged from 97 X 10(3) to 101 X 10(3). The enzyme was composed of two subunits with the same molecular weight which ranged from 50 X 10(3) to 52 X 10(3), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Homogeneous enzyme preparations hydrolyse all the tested alpha-D-aldohexose 1-phosphate, D-(keto or aldo)hexose 6-phosphate, and pentose phosphate substrates significantly. When the microorganisms were transferred from growth medium with 1% glucose to that without glucose, there were dramatic increases in both the specific and total enzyme activities. At least three isozymes appeared to be present in S. cereviseae, and two appeared to be present in E. coli B, E. coli var. communior, and N. meningitidis. Rabbit antiserum immunized against sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase purified from E. coli B cross-reacted with both the crude extracts and purified preparations of the enzyme from the other microorganisms. The presence of neither sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity nor immunocrossreacting material was detected in the following microorganisms: Aspergillus niger, Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilis, Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium butyricum, Corynebacterium xerosis, Flavobacterium aquatile, Flavobacterium synxanthum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Micrococcus coralinus, Neisseria perflava, Neurospora crassa, Penicilium expansum, Penicilium notatum, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Saccharomyces fermenti, Sarcina lutea, and Streptomyces antibioticus. At present, no conclusive relationship can be established between the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and the enzyme sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms. The physiological role of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase as a transferase and regulatory enzyme is discussed.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - Bacteremia associated with decubitus ulcers.
AB  - We studied 104 episodes of bacteremia in 102 patients with decubitus ulcers observed over five years in the hospitals of one metropolitan area. The ulcers were considered to be the "probable" source of bacteremia in 49% of episodes. Another site of infection was documented in 86% of patients. Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli were the most frequent blood isolates in these patients, but only Bacteroides species correlated with "probable" origin of bacteremia from the ulcers. The overall mortality was 55%, with 51% of deaths being attributed to infection. These findings emphasize the importance of decubitus ulcers as potential sources of bacteremia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Transferable resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - In conjugational crosses, three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one Serratia marcescens strain have been demonstrated to transfer resistance determinants to newer types of cephalosporins. While Klebsiella strains donated cefotaxime, cefamandole and cefuroxime resistance to Escherichia coli K-12 recipients, the genetic analysis of exconjugants after the transfer of plasmids from Serratia strains to Proteus or Salmonella recipients showed that the cefoxitin resistance determinant was also co-transferred. In subsequent transfer cycles of this plasmid, cefotaxime and cefoxitin resistance determinants segregated in contrast to the relative stability of plasmids derived from Klebsiella strains in subsequent transfer cycles. From results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that in some strains of nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to newer cephalosporins could be transmissible and thus plasmid-located.
TI  - In vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas sp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. The majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. Although most Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and Bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. Activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. Enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. Enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid pH than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. There was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. Resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of canine urinary bacteria to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary tract infections. Antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Escherichia coli; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, Str faecium, and Str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of Str canis. No antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin was closest, at 89%.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  - Since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Alcaligenes faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. Addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. However, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). Ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. Growth in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). Addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. The results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.
TI  - Routine use of BACTEC 16B bottles to remove antibacterial and antitumor agents from blood cultures of cancer patients.
AB  - A total of 1,764 paired sets of BACTEC 6B and 16B blood culture bottles were collected from patients for analysis. The majority of the patients were receiving antibiotic therapy at the time the blood specimens were collected. A total of 126 isolates were considered clinically significant. Of these, 58 grew in both 6B and 16B bottles, 25 grew only in 6B bottles, and 43 grew only in 16B bottles. In both bottles, the same amount of time was required to detect a positive culture. In 18 patients, septicemias were detected in the 16B bottles that were not detected in the 6B bottles. In seven patients, microorganisms were detected in the 6B bottles that were not detected in the 16B bottles. Interestingly, the antibiotic therapy was changed for only 4 of the 18 patients whose septicemias were detected only in the 16B bottles. Finally, an in vitro study showed that certain chemotherapeutic agents can cause the inhibition of growth of several microorganisms when tested in 6B bottles. These inhibitory effects were reduced or eliminated when the same organism-drug combinations were tested in 16B bottles.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. The compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. It was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens). The MIC95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. The drug was less active against Staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (MIC95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. Levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. Due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the MIC95 of all strains tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.
TI  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine and the antimicrobial agents gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cefalothin, cefotiam and cefsulodin.
AB  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid and gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, cefotiam or cefsulodin, used against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was determined by measuring the effect of the drugs and combination of drugs on growth of the bacteria in an automated turbidimeter. The combination of drugs was considered to be synergistic when the growth inhibiting effect of the combination was greater than that of the combined action of each of the drugs separately. Deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid together with either gentamicin or cefsulodin showed synergy in 10 out of 10, and 5 out of 6 cultures respectively, whereas deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid with chloramphenicol, cephalothin or cefotiam was synergistic in 6 out of 14, 5 out of 11, and 3 out of 6 cultures. This synergistic effect was much lower when microorganisms were incubated with deferoxamine combined with the various antibiotics but without ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid alone had no synergistic effect. When deferoxamine was saturated with iron, its antibacterial effect was completely abolished.
TI  - Homologous sequences other than insertion elements can serve as recombination sites in plasmid drug resistance gene amplification.
AB  - A plasmid (pRR983) was constructed which has a gene coding for neomycin and kanamycin resistance flanked by direct repeats of regions of homology which contain no known insertion sequences. pRR983 does not have any homologous IS1 sequences. Growth of Proteus mirabilis harboring pRR983 in medium containing high concentration of neomycin resulted in cells which were highly resistant to both neomycin and kanamycin. Plasmid DNA was analyzed by using restriction endonucleases. In most cases the neomycin resistance gene had been tandemly duplicated by using the homologous DNA sequences flanking the resistance gene as recombination sites. This is analogous to tandem duplication of drug resistance genes on NR1 using the two direct repeats of IS1 as recombination sites. The amplified plasmid DNA returned to its original structure by the deletion of amplified neomycin resistance determinants when the host cells were cultured without selection for high resistance to neomycin.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Bacteremia in a Veterans Administration Medical Center (1961-1981).
AB  - Laboratory data on blood cultures were reviewed for the period 1961-1981. Blood cultures accounted for 18% of all bacterial cultures. Nine percent of all blood cultures were positive for growth, including pathogens and contaminants. Of these, 21% wer contaiminants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common contaminant while Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently occurring pathogens, respectively. Four percent of all positive blood cultures, involving pathogens, had multiple organisms with E. coli the most common. There was no drastic change in the frequency of occurrence of Gram negative or positive isolates over the years, but certain pathogens like Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp. and Group A Streptococci were more common from 1971-81 than 1961-70. One percent of all patients with positive blood cultures had the same organism for two months or longer. Analysis of these longer occurring infections yielded a mean of 15, median of 7 and range of 2-87 months. E. coli was the most common pathogen in these chronic infections, followed by S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Leukocyte agglomeration test to reveal bacterial infections in mice.
AB  - A simple and rapid procedure was used to detecting covert bacterial infections in mice. The procedure was based on observations that bacterial infections were associated with clumping of leukocytes. A large drop of citrated venous blood was placed on a slide and allowed to spread. After fixation and staining the percentage of agglomerated leukocytes was determined by counting. Experimental urinary tract infections caused by either Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis served as a model to test the efficacy of the method. Elevation of leukocyte agglomeration was observed in these localized infections.
TI  - Nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  - During a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. The annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. Gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (24 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and Proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). Candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. The burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of Enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). The plastic surgery service had more Serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more Escherichia coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. More than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. Hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. Estimates were made of the economic benefits of successful control programs.
TI  - Studies on beta-lactam antibiotics. VII. Effect on antibacterial activity of the  oxime O-substituents with various functional groups in the 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-oxyiminoacetamido]cephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and in vitro activity of the 7-[O-substituted oxyiminoacetamido]cephalosporins (I) without substitution at 3-position of a cephem nucleus are described. Effect of changing the oxime O-substituents (R1) with various functional groups in the 7-acyl residue on antibacterial activity was examined. Against Gram-positive bacteria, cephems with hydrophilic functions in the R1 moiety such as hydroxyethyl, aminoethyl and carboxymethyl groups showed decrease of the activity, while cephems with lipophilic functions such as cyanomethyl, methylthiomethyl and halogenoethyl groups exhibited increase of the activity. However, influence of the substituents (R1) on activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed to be relatively independent of the nature of their functional groups.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). Fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. Episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. Twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones were polymicrobial. Significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: Escherichia coli (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Pseudomonas cepacia (1), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (2), Klebsiella (2), Enterobacter aerogenes (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Total dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). The overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. Local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. Enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. Ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of the updated MS-2 Bacterial Identification system in comparison with the API 20E system.
AB  - The recently updated MS-2 Bacterial Identification system software (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostic Division, Irving, Tex.) was compared with the original MS-2 Bacterial Identification software and the API 20E, using 968 strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The updated MS-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. API 20E and the original MS-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. MS-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. The percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. Organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic groups were tested. Direct comparison of the two MS-2 programs showed that the updated MS-2 software increased the identification accuracy of Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia stuartii, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. A decrease in accuracy was seen with Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. The remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. The updated MS-2 software appears to significantly improve the identification accuracy of the MS-2 Bacterial Identification system.
TI  - Interaction of bacterial pili and leukocytes.
AB  - Since Duguid and Guilles first described the ability of piliated bacteria to bind to leukocytes, much has been learned about the nature of this interaction. Mannose-sensitive (MS) pili bind to specific mannose-containing receptors on the leukocyte surface. While MS pili are responsible for attachment, the relative hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface determines whether the organism is internalized. Both binding and ingestion trigger the leukocyte to respond with degranulation and enhanced oxidative activity. The response to piliated bacteria, however, is delayed as compared to bacteria opsonized with serum, which may account for the reduced bactericidal activity associated with pili-mediated phagocytosis. A number of factors appear to influence the significance of pili-mediated phagocytosis in vivo. These include natural selective pressures in the host tissue, the ability of the organism to undergo pili phase transition and the presence of serum or other host opsonic factors. Antipili antibody does not enhance leukocyte killing of MS + Escherichia coli, but does stimulate leukocyte metabolic activity. Antipili antibody may, therefore, have an adverse effect on the infectious process by promoting the extracellular release of inflammatory material from the granulocyte.
TI  - Sensitization of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics and complement by a nontoxic oligopeptide.
AB  - A major virulence factor of bacteria that cause generalized infections is their resistance to the lytic action of the complement cascade, an important defence mechanism of the host. Invasive Gram-negative enteric bacteria, which cause about one-third of all bacteraemic infections, are completely resistant to lysis by complement, even in the presence of hyperimmune serum. The same bacteria are also resistant to many antibiotics that are effective therapeutic agents against other bacteria, as the outermost surface layer (the outer membrane) of the bacteria functions as a permeability barrier. Here we show that it is possible to sensitize such bacteria to both complement and antibiotics by using an agent that binds to the outer membrane. This agent is a nontoxic derivative of polymyxin which by itself has no bactericidal action.
TI  - Comparative study of fosfomycin activity in Mueller-Hinton media and in tissues.
AB  - Fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  L-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. The latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. The relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus was studied in Mueller-Hinton broth. An almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. Fosfomycin activity against Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fosfomycin against Staph. aureus Streptococcus faecalis, E. coli, Ent. cloacae, Pr. mirabilis, and Ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in Mueller-Hinton broth. With few exceptions the MICs in Mueller-Hinton broth (with glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).
TI  - [Frequency of isolation and antibiotic sensitivity of strains of coli bacilli from urinary tract infections isolated in private laboratories].
AB  - Frequency of isolation and antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains isolated  from urinary tract infections in private laboratory. The urinary tract infections are not the most frequent infections in man. However cytobacteriological analysis are often required for the diagnosis. The critical evaluation of 3000 analysis brings the followed conclusions: 1) 16% of the analysis correspond to a urinary tract infection; 2) the most frequently isolated germs are E. coli (65%) and Proteus mirabilis (11%); 3) E. coli is always very susceptible to antibiotics especially aminosides (100%) polymyxine E (92%), cotrimoxazole (91%) and quinolones (90%); 4) hospital bacteria can be found with a low frequency. However, in our study, Staphylococcus aureus has been isolated in 6% of the cases. This seems to be in relation with the passage of patients in an obstetric clinic.
TI  - Norfloxacin versus cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections.
AB  - In a randomised prospective study 61 patients with lower urinary tract infection  received either 200 mg norfloxacin (33 patients) or 480 mg cotrimoxazole (28 patients) twice daily for ten days. Pathogens included Escherichia coli in 48 patients, Proteus mirabilis in ten patients, and Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in one patient each. The MICs of norfloxacin and cotrimoxazole were less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l and less than or equal to 1 mg/l respectively. On the tenth day of treatment 94% of the patients receiving norfloxacin and 89% of the patients receiving cotrimoxazole were clinically cured, and the pathogens were eradicated in 94% and 96% of the patients respectively. At six week follow-up one patient given cotrimoxazole and two given norfloxacin had a reinfection. No side-effects or toxicity were observed with the exception of a diffuse rash in one patient receiving cotrimoxazole in whom treatment was discontinued. It is concluded that norfloxacin is safe and as effective as cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower UTI and should have an important role to play whenever multiresistant organisms are implicated.
TI  - [Resistance spectrum of various bacteria against cefotiam in 3 Berlin clinics].
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cefotiam (Spizef) was tested using the agar diffusion test method according to DIN 58940 and compared with the antibacterial activity of 12 other routinely tested antibacterial chemotherapeutics. A total of 3000 strains from patients' specimens from the University Hospital of the Free University of Berlin and the Municipal Wenckebach Hospital, West Berlin, was tested. Cefotiam proved effective against strains of Staphylococcus aureus in 99,4%, Escherichia coli in 99,7%, Klebsiella species in 97,8%, Enterobacter species in 90,3%, Proteus mirabilis in 98,7%, indolpositive Proteus species in 91,7%, Citrobacter in 92,6%, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci in 99,3% of all strains tested. There were only few sensitive strains of Enterococci and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Susceptibility of blood isolates to various antibiotics, in particular to cephalosporins.
AB  - Of 760 bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of acutely ill patients in a general hospital in Hong Kong for 1 year, 69.9% of the isolates were Gram-negative aerobes mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.0% were Gram-positive aerobes mainly Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and 8.1% were anaerobes mainly Bacteroides spp. The susceptibility of the aerobic isolates to various antibiotics was tested. Ampicillin was found to be active mainly against the enterococci and some other Gram-positive organisms while most isolates of Staph. aureus and the Gram-negative bacteria were resistant. In contrast, cephalothin was found only slightly less active than the second generation cephalosporins against Gram-negative blood isolates but considerably more active against Staph. aureus and other Gram-positive isolates. The three aminoglycosides tested, i.e., gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, showed similar good activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, but amikacin had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting most of the other Gram-negative isolates as well as isolates of Staph. aureus. The third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, all had a high activity against the Gram-negative but a reduced activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. Ceftazidime had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting all the Gram-negative isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while cefotaxime showed the best overall activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative blood isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Purification and properties of the recA protein of Proteus mirabilis. Comparison  with Escherichia coli recA protein; specificity of interaction with single strand binding protein.
AB  - The product of the cloned recA+ gene of Proteus mirabilis substitutes for a defective recA protein in Escherichia coli recA- mutants and restores recombination, repair, and prophage induction functions to near normal levels (Eitner, G., Adler, B., Lanzov, V. A., and Hofemeister, J. (1982) Mol. Gen. Genet. 185, 481-486). In this paper, we report the purification to near homogeneity of the P. mirabilis recA protein (recApm). The polypeptide has a molecular weight similar to that of E. coli recA protein (recAec) and shows partial identity with recAec when reacted against antibodies specific for the E. coli recA protein. recApm catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. We have compared the recombination-like activities of recApm with those of recAec and found them to be similar. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, stoichiometric amounts of recApm promote the complete reciprocal exchange of strands between gapped circular and linear duplex DNA molecules. The enzyme also efficiently promotes the formation of D-loops from circular duplex DNA and homologous single-stranded fragments. However, although recApm and recAec share the above physical and functional similarities, they differ in their ability to interact with the E. coli single strand binding protein to catalyze the transfer of one DNA strand from a linear duplex to a single-stranded circle.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new 7 alpha-methoxycephem antibiotic, was fundamentally and clinically studied, and the following results were obtained. The antibacterial activities of T-1982 against clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were determined in comparison with those of CER, CEZ, CMZ and CTT. Against S. aureus, CER and CEZ exhibited excellent activity, whereas T-1982 was less active with the peak MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml even with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. The activity of T-1982 was equal to that of CTT and by far superior to that of CER, CEZ and CMZ against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, the peak MICs with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml being less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml, less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2-0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. Against S. marcescens, T-1982 was superior to CMZ and CTT and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml or less, whereas all the strains were resistant to CER and CEZ. The MIC of T-1982 against most strains of P. aeruginosa was more than 100 micrograms/ml. 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of T-1982 was administered by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion to 23 pediatric patients to measure serum levels and urinary recovery. At 30 minutes after one shot injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the highest serum levels of 22.0-38.8 micrograms/ml and 52.4-80 micrograms/ml were observed, the half-lives being 1.32 hours and 1.76 hours. When given by 1 hour drip infusion, the serum levels attained the peaks of 29.2-42.6 micrograms/ml and 49.0-75.6 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, the half-lives being 1.24 hours and 1.19 hours. The urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 74.2-92.5% and 50.2-66.5% by one shot injection and 63.4-84.2% and 53.9-79.0% by drip infusion. T-1982 was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg by 30 minutes drip infusion to a child with purulent meningitis. The levels of T-1982 in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after administration were 4.8-6.7 micrograms/ml with the CSF/serum ratios of 4.4-8.4%. A total of 36 pediatric patients (21 cases of respiratory tract infection, 9 cases of urinary tract infection and each 1 case of purulent cervical lymphadenitis, scarlet fever, purulent meningitis, acute colitis, peritonitis and sinusitis) was treated with 40-80 mg/kg/day of T-1982 (252.6 mg/kg/day in purulent meningitis). The response was excellent in 27 patients and good in 7 patients, the efficacy rate being 94.4%. Diarrhea or eruption were observed in each 1 case. No abnormal laboratory findings were noted in any cases.
TI  - Simple additives to increase the activity of chlorhexidine digluconate against urinary pathogens.
AB  - The concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill Gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. Increased bactericidal activity was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (EDTA) and a buffer (Tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against Escherichia coli NCTC 86, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7650 Proteus mirabilis NCTC 8309 and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 8213. The type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per cent killing. The 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added EDTA and Tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. The potential of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in a general hospital: a two year survey.
AB  - For two years transferable antibiotic resistance (TAR) was studied by replicator  methods in strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a 900-bed hospital. Transfer to an Escherichia coli recipient was demonstrated in 21% of 7,800 Enterobacteriaceae. It was most common in Klebsiella (37% of isolates) and least in Acinetobacter (6%). The mean number of phenotypic resistance markers (RMs) transferred was higher from Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter cloacae than from E. coli or P. mirabilis. K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae especially transferred 7 or more RMs much more often than other species. Some RMs were associated with a particular species, e.g. streptomycin with E. coli, kanamycin or gentamicin with E. cloacae and kanamycin with P. mirabilis. The same was true of certain patterns of resistance transfer, e.g. Ap-Km and P. mirabilis, Ap-Sm and E. coli, Ap-Km-Gm-Tm-Cm and K. pneumoniae. However, many of the commonest resistance phenotypes were transferred from several species and from several biotypes within any given species. Resistance patterns transferred from E. coli were detected sporadically throughout, whereas many of those transferred from Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Proteus were found only for a limited time.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone in pediatric field].
AB  - The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone). The results were as follows: The sensitivity was estimated by the plate dilution method on 28 strains of S. aureus 26 strains of E. coli, 27 strains of K. pneumoniae, 25 strains of S. marcescens and 14 strains of Proteus sp. isolated from patients. The distribution of susceptibility of S. aureus was 1.25-25 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 12.5 micrograms/ml. The strains of 84.6% of E. coli were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.39 micrograms/ml. The strains of 77.8% of K. pneumoniae were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.2 microgram/ml. The strains of 96% of S. marcescens was inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. The distribution of susceptibility of Proteus sp. was 0.39-25 micrograms/ml. T-1982 was given to intravenous administration for 5 minutes and drip infusion for 30 minutes a single dose of 20 mg/kg of T-1982 to 2 and 2 children respectively. After intravenous administration of T-1982, the mean serum level was peak 88.4 +/- 8.7 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 52.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 4.6 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml at 6 hours respectively. Half-life was 89 minutes. And after drip infusion of T-1982, the mean serum level was 75.5 +/- 3.5 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes and 3.1 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml at 6.5 hours respectively. Half-life was 82 minutes. The mean urinary excretion rate was 94.7%, 57.4 +/- 11.0% up to 6 hours after intravenous administration and drip infusion respectively. T-1982 was effective in 13 cases out of 13 cases with bacterial infections. No side effects were observed except for 1 case with elevation of serum GOT, 1 case with elevation of serum GPT and 2 cases with eosinophilia.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - Relationship between cecal population levels of indigenous bacteria and translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
AB  - Translocation is defined as the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and other organs. The extent of translocation of certain indigenous, oxygen-tolerant bacteria from the cecum to the MLN, spleen, liver, kidney, and peritoneal cavity were determined in diassociated or triassociated gnotobiotic mice. Minimal bacterial translocation occurred to the spleen, liver, kidney, or peritoneal cavity. However, most bacterial strains readily translocated to the MLN. The percentage of the total population of each bacterial strain in the ceca was compared with the percentage of the total population of that strain in the MLN. There was a direct relationship between the numbers of a particular bacterial strain populating the ceca of diassociated or triassociated mice and the numbers of viable bacteria of this strain present in the MLN. Thus, the cecal population level of a particular bacterial strain determined the numbers of viable bacteria of this strain translocating to the MLN. The translocation of these bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract is an important first step in the pathogenesis of infection caused by members of the normal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Evolution of complex resistance transposons from an ancestral mercury transposon.
AB  - The molecular interrelationship of a transposon family which confers multiple antibiotic resistance and is assumed to have been generated from an ancestral mercury transposon was analyzed. Initially, the transposons Tn2613 (7.2 kilobases), encoding mercury resistance, and Tn2608 (13.5 kilobases), encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistances, were isolated and their structures were analyzed. Next, the following transposons were compared with respect to their genetic and physical maps: Tn2613 and Tn501, encoding mercury resistance; Tn2608 and Tn21, encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistance; Tn2607 and Tn4, encoding streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance; and Tn2603, encoding mercury, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance. The results suggest that the transposons encoding multiple resistance were evolved from an ancestral mercury transposon.
TI  - Biocidal braided sutures.
AB  - Once sutures become contaminated it is difficult for local tissue defenses or antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria and prevent infection. Impregnation of sutures with antibiotics before implantation is one way to prevent bacterial seeding of the suture surface. In this study, braided silk and Dacron sutures were impregnated with the antibiotic complex, neomycin palmitate. Using our standard wound model in the mouse, the efficacy of these biocidal sutures was determined in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Implantation of these biocidal sutures into tissue contaminated with 10(7) organisms resulted in substantially decreased numbers of bacteria as compared with that of tissue receiving control sutures. In most cases, the tissue bacterial counts in the presence of biocidal sutures were also considerably lower than that for similarly contaminated tissue without a suture. Consequently, the presence of the neomycin palmitate eliminated the infection-potentiating effect of the suture. The therapeutic benefit of the biocidal sutures was related to the dose of antibiotic complex and was not adversely affected by delaying suture implantation.
TI  - Surgical management of benign oesophago-pleural fistula.
AB  - Three cases of oesophago-pleural fistula are presented. Two resulted from foreign body perforation of the oesophagus and one followed left lower lobectomy for bronchiectasis. All three presented late; the time lapse ranged from 6 days to 2 months. An initial course of conservative treatment was given to all three patients. Alimentation via nasogastric tube feeding, gastrostomy or total parenteral nutrition was carried out. The pleural fluid grew the anaerobe, Bacteriodies melaninogenicus, in all three cases. Gram-negative aerobes, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, were also cultured. Closed intercostal drainage and a course of appropriate antibiotics were instituted. The patients were subjected to surgery after the infection had been brought under control. Simple repair was performed in two patients. Exclusion of the oesophageal leak with drainage and later reconstruction was carried out in the third patient. Although all three patients recovered, the morbidity was considerable. The duration of hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 months.
TI  - [Effect of multiresistance on the minimal inhibitory concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and 6 comparing substances against P. aeruginosa and 4 Enterobacteriaceae species].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa and four species of Enterobacteriaceae were compared with those of more sensitive ones in N-f-thienamycin and six other antibiotics. The greatest difference between these two differently resistant bacterial populations was found in cefoperazone and the beta-lactamase-instable piperacillin. The latter was used for comparison purposes. The activity of cefsulodin was distinctly reduced in multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Cefotaxime and lamoxactam displayed slightly elevated MICs in multiresistant strains. In N-f-thienamycin a significant difference between the multiresistant and the more sensitive population could not be verified (p greater than 0.05). In this regard it resembles fosfomycin. beta-lactam antibiotics could be ranked by means of correlation analysis of their MICs. Using piperacillin as a reference antibiotic the following order of succession could be arranged according to correlation coefficients in P. aeruginosa: cefoperazone, cefsulodin, lamoxactam, cefotaxime and N-f-thienamycin. For the Enterobacteriaceae species some antibiotics could not be evaluated in this test. Moreover, it was recognized that there was an obvious correlation between the activities of lamoxactam and cefotaxime in P. aeruginosa (r = 0.81) and E. coli (r = 0.80). A correlation was also observed between those of cefsulodin and cefoperazone in P. aeruginosa (r = 0.75). Lower correlation coefficients were seen in N-f-thienamycin with cefoperazone, piperacillin and cefsulodin in P. aeruginosa and with cefoperazone in Klebsiella spec.. Notwithstanding, strains resistant to cefsulodin and cefoperazone were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of N-f-thienamycin. These results showed that in N-f-thienamycin, cefotaxime and lamoxactam multiresistance has only a minimal influence on the MICs of the species of Enterobacteriaceae examined. For therapeutic considerations concerning multiresistance the small differences recognized among these three antibiotics might be without significance. However, N-f-thienamycin was distinctly more active in multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Effect of cefaclor in urinary tract infections (the first report)].
AB  - A part of our continuous investigation on the clinical effect of cefaclor against urinary tract infections was reported herein. Cefaclor, a daily dose of 0.75 g t.i.d., has been applied for the treatment of (I) 26 cases with the simple UTI and (II) 41 cases with the complicated. Rates of effectiveness were obtained 100% in (I) and 80% in (II). Side effects were noted in 8 cases (8.4%) out of total 95 cases.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefotaxime].
AB  - Susceptibilities of 737 strains of 19 species of bacteria to cefotaxime (CTX) were determined based on the inhibition zone diameter obtained by the single-disc method. Four categories were assessed. 1. Susceptibility of clinical isolates to CTX and 6 other antibiotics Against most strains, CTX showed higher antibacterial activity than other drugs (CET, ABPC, SBPC, CMZ, GM, AMK), especially for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. Furthermore, CTX was more active than the other antibiotics against E. coli, Indole (+) Proteus, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella sp., S. marcescens, H. influenzae and E. cloacae. 2. Susceptibility of strains isolated from different clinical materials CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity against most strains isolated from sputum, urine, pus, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, CTX was occasionally less than potent AMK and GM against strains isolated from bile. Against P. aeruginosa strains derived from clinical materials, the following results were obtained: AMK greater than CFS, FOM greater than CTX greater than GM greater than SBPC 3. Susceptibility of clinical isolates in 7 different fields CTX was the most active antibiotic tested in the fields of internal medicine, pediatrics, urology, obstetrics & gynecology, dermatology and otorhinolaryngology. But in surgery, CTX was less potent than GM and AMK. 4. Susceptibility of clinical isolates of inpatients and outpatients CTX showed excellent activity against many beta-lactamase resistant strains isolated from patients.
TI  - The relationship of disc position to zone-of-inhibition size in the disc-agar diffusion test.
AB  - One hundred sixteen clinical isolates of Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were tested against cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefamandole and piperacillin by disc-agar diffusion. Zones-of-inhibition of discs dropped near the center of the plate were compared with those dropped near the periphery. In 28% of the comparisons the inner and outer zones differed by 2 mm or more. Of those, the inner zone was larger 2.5 times more often than the outer zone. Results suggest that the chances of obtaining a susceptible result are greater when discs are placed near the center as opposed to the periphery of the plate.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Cefotetan: profile of in-vitro activity.
AB  - Cefotetan, a novel 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, was shown to be comparable to other third-generation cephalosporins when tested in vitro against 1063 Gram-negative clinical isolates of 11 species. Ninety per cent of all isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii were inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan between 0.07 and 3.2 mg/l. Activity against Gram-positive cocci was about equal to that of moxalactam. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were resistant. Cefotetan inhibited about two-thirds of Enterobacter strains at 16 mg/l. beta-Lactamases of Enterobacter cloacae highly resistant to cefotetan inactivated this cephamycin. These strains were resistant to most other beta-lactams as well. Synergism between cefotetan and aminoglycosides was found in 8 out of 16 Gram-negatives.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefotetan, other beta-lactams and netilmicin.
AB  - In-vitro activity of cefotetan was compared to that of other cephalosporins netilmicin. Cefotetan at very low concentrations inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. Poor activity was seen for all beta-lactams against Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. Activity of cefotetan against Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of ceftazidime and moxalactam. Netilmicin was the only agent equally active against all Gram-negative bacilli and Staph. aureus tested. Under conditions simulating serum levels cefotetan demonstrated rapid and long-acting bactericidal activity and bacteria exposed to these concentrations required up to 10.2 h to recover from the effect of the antibiotic. Six out of 15 strains did not recover fully.
TI  - [Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in children. Report of 4 cases].
AB  - Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (X.G.P.) is a rare unilateral manifestation of chronic interstitial nephritis. 4 new cases of X.G.P. in children are reported. The authors review 60 cases of the literature since 1963. The X.G.P. has no predominant sex distribution. The age extended especially between 1 to 5 years. The diffuse type is more common in boys, and the localized type in girls. The clinical signs : fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, urinary infection, abdominal mass. Proteus Mirabilis is the main organism in the diffuse form and Escherichia Coli in the focal form. Actually, the disease is often diagnosed before surgery. The treatment is always nephrectomy and the prognosis is very good (benign). The final diagnosis of X.G.P. can only be made by histological examination. Etiopathogenesis remains obscure : urinary tract infection and obstruction, arterial and veinous lesions, local immunity deficiency.
TI  - [Microbial colonization of the nasopharynx, external auditory canal, hair of the  head and armpit in high performance swimmers].
AB  - From 50 high-performance swimmers, who were subdivided into three training groups, swabs were taken before and after the swimming training from the nose, throat and the external auditory canal, and bacterial samples were taken according to the Rodac method from the hair of the head and the armpit for a quantitative and qualitative analysis. - No significant quantitation differences were found to exist in the bacterial flora before and after the swimming training, except for the external auditory canal where the bacterial population had increased, and the armpit where it had diminished. - A qualitative comparison of the normal flora revealed no noticeable differences in the population before and after the swimming training for the three training groups. - However, differences in the pathogenic flora were identified in the three training groups. A higher germ count was found in those swimmers who had been training more intensely for a longer period of time than the members of a junior training group. This finding is particularly striking for P. aeruginosa which was located in the ears of those high-performance swimmers who belonged to the group with the most intensive swimming training. The carriers of Staph. aureus accounted for 46 per cent of the test persons. This species had primarily settled in the vestibule of the nose. - The swimming training hardly influences the invasion of the hair of the head with pathogens. The compulsory use of bathing cap serves general hygienic aspects rather than prophylactic hygienic purposes.
TI  - [Effects of 5-bromouracil and 5-bromodeoxyuridine in combination with 8-aza-adenine on the UV sensitivity of bacteria].
AB  - The presence of 5-bromouracil (BU) as well as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BUdR) in the cultivation media of bacteria results in the distinct increase of UV sensitivity. With the nucleic acid base analogue 8-azaadenine (8-AA) a similar effect was confirmed, however, not so pronounced. In the experiments reported here the combined action of BU or BUdR and 8-AA on Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus was investigated. The sensitization effect of BUdR does not increase if 8-AA is present additionally during cultivation. On the contrary, a decrease of sensibilization occurs. This result may be caused by the protective effect of the adenine derivative against UV irradiation, if it is present in the cell, but not incorporated into the DNA.
TI  - [Clinico-therapeutic and microbiologic studies of the Bulgarian antibiotic cephalothin in patients with active pyelonephritis].
AB  - A total of 38 patients with active pyelonephritis and significant bacteriuria were treated with the Bulgarian antibiotic cephalotin, the bacteria isolated from their urine manifesting susceptibility to the Bulgarian broad-spectrum antibiotic cephalotin. Twenty six from the patients were with preserved renal function, and 12 with various stages of renal insufficiency. The subjective complaints, febrility, leukocyturia and bacteriuria were best affected. The highest anti-bacterial effect was observed in the patients with uroinfections caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella and staphylococci. Cephalotin has a good tolerance and has no adverse effects. Painful infiltrations were established in some of the patients in the region of the site of intramuscular application, with a transitory character. Cephalotin was assessed, on the base of the study, to be a good and prospective broad-scpectrum antibiotic, deserving to be widely applied in the therapeutic practice.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the lower urinary tract in women with long-term indwelling urethral catheter.
AB  - The bacterial colonization of urethra and urine was studied over long periods in  16 hospitalized women with long-term indwelling bladder catheter. The cultured flora was polymicrobic and, except for Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, rapidly changing. The colonization patterns showed marked inter-species variations. P. mirabilis was the species most commonly found, and in the urethra it was significantly more persistent than the other species. Unlike the other species, P. mirabilis was rarely found in urine without concomitant urethral growth. Prophylactic measures aimed to reduce the risk of permanent colonization by this pathogen, which is rendered particularly harmful by its urease production, should therefore be directed towards the urethra and the periurethral area.
TI  - Ceftriaxone - a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin. In vitro activity against gram-negative bacilli sensitive and resistant to gentamicin.
AB  - Ceftriaxone (Rocephin 13-9904) was tested against 409 isolates of gram-negative bacilli. No difference was found in the susceptibility of the 262 gentamicin-sensitive or 147 gentamicin-resistant isolates to ceftriaxone. Comparison with other third-generation cephalosporins showed that ceftriaxone was as active as or more active than lamoxactam, cefoperazone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp., Klebsiella. Ceftriaxone was not as active as ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than lamoxactam, cefoperazone and cefotaxime.
TI  - Randomized prospective study of the comparative efficacy of spectinomycin and gentamicin in urinary tract infections.
AB  - A prospective, randomized study was undertaken in 32 hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections to compare the efficacy of spectinomycin versus gentamicin. Spectinomycin was found to be of equal efficacy if not more efficacious in eradicating Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis in our patient population. No significant side-effects were noted. A review of the literature with emphasis on the use of spectinomycin in infections other than anogenital gonorrhea is made.
TI  - Mezlocillin treatment of septicemia in general hospitals.
AB  - Gramnegative septicemia in 23 patients from different Norwegian departments of general medicine or surgery was treated with mezlocillin. Most of the patients were old, and 14 patients were considered compromised due to underlying disease. In the majority of cases the septicemia originated from urinary tract infections. Uneventful recovery was accomplished in 16 patients (70%) and another 5 cases improved. In 2 patients no clinical effects were observed within 3 days of treatment. Apart from diarrhoea in 5 of the cases, no side-effects occurred. Mezlocillin proved to be a safe and efficient drug for the treatment of gramnegative septicemias of the type that is most commonly encountered in Norwegian general hospitals.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of norfloxacin.
AB  - Norfloxacin, a new quinoline derivative, was studied in vitro, and determinations of agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and broth dilution MICs and MBCs were made. Nalidixic acid and cinoxacin were used as comparative agents. Norfloxacin was found to be extremely active against all strains tested of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp. Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., with MICs normally below 1 microgram/ml. It also was found to be highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococci, which are all resistant to nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. The MICs for norfloxacin obtained by broth dilution were slightly higher than those obtained by agar dilution, whereas the reverse was true for nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. The MBCs of norfloxacin were only slightly higher than the MICs, even at high inocula. The in vitro activity of norfloxacin was not dependent on the inoculum size, whereas both the MICs and the MBCs of nalidixic acid increased markedly for many of the strains tested when the inoculum was increased in broth dilution from 10(3) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. Norfloxacin seems to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas spp. and other species today requiring the use of injectable antibiotics.
TI  - A prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  - Bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. The mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. Most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. Even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. Of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. Mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to Providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. Thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.
TI  - R-plasmid transfer in a wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Enteric bacteria have been examined for their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance in a wastewater treatment plant. Resistant Salmonella enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli were isolated from clinical specimens and primary sewage effluent. Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and tetracycline was demonstrated by spread plate and tube dilution techniques. Plasmid mediation of resistance was shown by ethidium bromide curing, agarose gel electrophoresis, and direct cell transfer. Each donor was mated with susceptible E. coli and Shigella sonnei. Mating pairs (and recipient controls) were suspended in unchlorinated primary effluent that had been filtered and autoclaved. Suspensions were added to membrane diffusion chambers which were then placed in the primary and secondary setting tanks of the wastewater treatment plant. Resistant recombinants were detected by replica plating nutrient agar master plates onto xylose lysine desoxycholate agar plates that contained per milliliter of medium 10 micrograms of ampicillin, 30 micrograms of chloramphenicol, 10 micrograms of streptomycin, 100 micrograms of sulfadiazine, or 30 micrograms of tetracycline. Mean transfer frequencies for laboratory matings were 2.1 X 10(-3). In situ matings for primary and secondary settling resulted in frequencies of 4.9 X 10(-5) and 7.5 X 10(-5), respectively. These values suggest that a significant level of resistance transfer occurs in wastewater treatment plants in the absence of antibiotics as selective agents.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of T-1982, a new semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic.
AB  - The activities of T-1982 (sodium 7 beta-[(2R, 3S)-2-(4-ethyl-2, 3-dioxo-1-piperazine-carboxamido)-3-hydroxybutanamido]-7 alpha-methoxy-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylate) against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were compare with those of cefmetazole, cefoxitin, cefazolin, and cefoperazone. T-1982 was active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including genera resistant to the other cephalosporins. T-1982 exhibited greater activity than did cefmetazole, cefoxitin, cefazolin, or cefoperazone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens and was also highly active against Bacteroides fragilis. T-1982 was as stable to various beta-lactamases as were cefmetazole and cefoxitin. The therapeutic activities of T-1982 in mice experimentally infected with various gram-negative bacteria were superior to those of cefmetazole, cefoxitin, cefazolin, and cefoperazone.
TI  - Isolation of anaerobic organisms from kidney in serious renal infections.
AB  - We have studied 45 patients who underwent nephrectomy owing to unilateral renal sepsis for anaerobic and aerobic bacterial growth in the urine and kidney. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from 11 patients: 10 had positive kidney cultures, and only 1 had positive kidney and urine cultures. There was a distinct relationship between anaerobic infection of the kidney and urinary tract obstruction; 44 per cent of the obstructed kidneys yielded anaerobic organisms versus only 11 per cent of the unobstructed kidneys. Bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobic organism most often cultured. It is suggested that cultures for anaerobic organisms be performed together with aerobic cultures in patients with symptomatic upper urinary tract infections associated with urinary obstruction. In patients in whom anaerobic infection is suspected, in spite of negative anaerobic cultures, antibiotic treatment for anaerobes should be added to the existing therapeutic measures.
TI  - [Cefroxadine and cephalexin in urinary tract infections. Kinetics of germ elimination].
AB  - Cefroxadine and cephalexin were compared in a double-blind study in patients with complicated urinary tract infections. Patients were treated orally with 1 g t.i.d. for five days. Bacterial counts in the urine were determined 1, 3 and 8 hours after the first dose and on the second, third and fifth day of treatment. A decrease in the bacterial population below 10(4) organisms/ml of urine was taken as being indicative of chemotherapeutic effect. Urine specimens were inactivated enzymatically before culture to eliminate any residual cephalosporin. A significant reduction in the bacterial count was seen one and three hours after the first dose, and, to a much greater extent, after eight hours. Reduction in the bacterial count was more frequent in the group treated with cefroxadine. The results during the first eight hours indicate that cefroxadine kills more rapidly than cephalexin, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. Whether the transient differences observed in the rates of inhibition are of clinical relevance remains uncertain.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - Outer membrane permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Mutant strains lacking outer membrane protein(s) were isolated from Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae. The outer membrane protein(s) of P. mirabilis and E. cloacae corresponding to E. coli porin were identified on the basis of their function, namely, their ability to allow the permeation of glucose as demonstrated by [14C]glucose uptake by intact cells. P. mirabilis has only one outer membrane pore protein (molecular weight, 40,000), but E. cloacae has at least two such proteins (molecular weights, 37,000 and 39,000 to 40,000). When the bacteria lost these proteins or porin, the outer membrane permeation of cefazolin was found to be greatly reduced in these three species. Such a change in the outer membrane permeation closely correlated with a significant decrease in the bacterial susceptibility to cephalosporins, including cefoxitin. These results suggested that the main pathway for cephalosporin permeation is the pore made up of these proteins. The 39,000- to 40,000-molecular-weight protein in E. cloacae was also assumed to play an important role in the outer membrane permeation of tetracycline and chloramphenicol. On the other hand, the permeation route of penicillins was obscure. The susceptibility to penicillins, except in some cases, was little influenced by the absence of the proteins. Ampicillin was found to pass through the outer membrane via the same route as the cephalosporins, but the possibility that ampicillin and other penicillins possess another unknown route for outer membrane permeation could not be ruled out.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
AB  - Basic and clinical studies were made on cefmenoxime (CMX) in pediatric field, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of CMX against clinically isolated and maintained strains was examined. CMX had stronger antibacterial activity than CEZ against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but CEZ had stronger antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. 2. The blood concentrations of CMX, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a one-shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CMX were 33.6, 15.1, 4.5, 2.5 and 0.6 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-life of 1.04 hours. 3. The blood concentrations of CMX, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg of CMX were 32.0, 55.2, 8.4, 4.2 and 1.0 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-lite of 0.96 hour. 4. A complete or partial clinical response to therapy with CMX was obtained in all 10 children with infectious diseases. 5. Bacteriological examination made on 3 patients showed that all bacteria had been eradicated, and that therapy was effective. The bacteria were E. coli in 2 patients and Proteus mirabilis in 1 patient. 6. The side effects produced were neutropenia, eosinophilia and skin eruption in 1 patient, and diarrhea in 1 patient.
TI  - [Clinical study with piperacillin in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - 1. Tissue concentrations of piperacillin (PIPC) between 80 to 150 minutes after the completion of 2 g/1 hour dripping infusion were 4.6 approximately 6.4 micrograms/g in the uterus, ovary and oviduct. These concentrations were higher than 80% MIC of the causative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides and Peptococcus, isolated from infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. 2. The PIPC concentration in the retroperitoneal space exudate reached a peak value of 34.7 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after the completion of 2 g/1 hour dripping infusion and thereafter maintained a constant level. These concentrations were sufficient for the therapy of parametritis. 3. We administered PIPC at 4 g per day for a period of 4 approximately 8 days to 4 patients with obstetrical and gynecological infectious diseases. All cases proved to respond effectively. No adverse effects and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. From the above, we considered that PIPC was an effective and safe antibiotic against infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Preliminary report comparing piperacillin and carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Piperacillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens. We compared the efficacy and safety of piperacillin versus carbenicillin in patients with complicated urinary tract infection. A total of 56 adult patients (mean age 55 years) in stable medical condition with 1 or more structural genitourinary abnormalities entered the study. Of these patients 27 were evaluated for antibiotic efficacy. There were 20 lower tract and 7 upper tract infections, of which 17 were acute and 10 were chronic. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 17 patients with 18 organisms received single agent treatment with 181 mg. per kg. intravenous piperacillin daily for 6 days and 10 patients with 11 organisms received 270 mg. per kg. intravenous carbenicillin daily for 6 days. Infecting organisms were Escherichia coli 45 per cent, Proteus mirabilis 14 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae 14 per cent. Enterobacter species 10 per cent, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7 per cent and so forth. Antimicrobial susceptibility assessed by measurement of minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion zone size demonstrated superior activity of piperacillin over carbenicillin for most micro-organisms tested. All patients responded clinically. The bacteriologic cure rate was 72 per cent at 5 to 9 days after therapy in both groups. Three patients who received piperacillin had urosepsis and were cured. No resistance emerged during therapy. Superinfections developed in 5 patients on carbenicillin (50 per cent) and in 4 patients on piperacillin (24 per cent), and none was resistant to piperacillin. Superinfections were attributed to catheterization and structural genitourinary abnormalities. The over-all incidence of adverse effects in patients on piperacillin was less than that of those on carbenicillin, 31 and 51 per cent respectively. Side effects in both groups were mild and did not require discontinuation of therapy. There were no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, or hematologic or renal function.
TI  - Phages C-2 and J: IncC and IncJ plasmid-dependent phages, respectively.
AB  - Phages C-2 and J were isolated from sewage. Phage C-2 was filamentous and formed  plaques on Salmonella typhimurium strains carrying various C plasmids. It also plated on Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens strains carrying particular C plasmids, but failed to form plaques on lines of Escherichia coli K12 strains harbouring most of these plasmids, although in all cases, phage multiplication on the strains was demonstrated. No phage increase occurred in any strain which lacked a C plasmid or contained plasmids of other incompatibility groups. The phage was sensitive to chloroform and, unlike other filamentous bacterial viruses, adsorbed to shafts of conjugative pili. It had a disc-like structure at the end which attached to the pilus. Phage C-2 had a buoyant density of 1 . 30 g cm-3 and a single-stranded circular DNA genome of 3 . 0 MDal. Phage J had an hexagonal head with an inter-apical distance of 40 nm and a short noncontractile tail. It was resistant to chloroform and diethyl ether. The phage formed plaques or propagated on E. coli strains harbouring some IncC plasmids and all IncJ and IncD plasmids tested. The phage did not form plaques but propagated on P. mirabilis and Ser. marcescens strains carrying these plasmids. It did not plate or propagate on S. typhimurium strains harbouring the plasmids. The plaques were very hazy and variable in size. The phage attached sparsely, at a site which appeared to be located at the base of the tail, to sides of conjugative pili.
TI  - Correlation of beta-lactamase production and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Incidence of beta-lactamase production (using the Nitrocefin test and isoelectric focusing) was evaluated on 284 strains of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Production of the various beta-lactamases was correlated with the resistance to different beta-lactam antibiotics. No obvious correlation between the beta-lactamase production and the resistance pattern was found. The most striking result was the lack of beta-lactamase production in 42.6% of the strains. About 50% or more of the Proteus morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia and Enterobacter strains produced no beta-lactamases, in contrast to E. coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus rettgeri strains which produced beta-lactamases extensively. The predominant enzyme was TEM 1, while TEM 2 enzyme was extremely common in Proteus mirabilis and Proteus rettgeri. Finally, it can be concluded from our results that the production of beta-lactamases can be regarded as an important but not the sole determinant of resistance of beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Experimental Gram-negative bacterial sepsis: optimal methylprednisolone requirements for prevention of mortality not preventable by antibiotics alone.
AB  
TI  - Treatment of urinary tract infections with cefotaxime: noncomparative and prospective comparative trials.
AB  - Three studies evaluated the efficacy of cefotaxime for the treatment of urinary tract infections. An open, multicenter, noncomparative trial included 477 patients who received a usual dose of 2 g of intravenous or intramuscular cefotaxime daily for five to 10 days. The maximal daily dosage in severe cases was 12 g. Pathogens included Escherichia coli and species of Citrobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Morganella, Providencia, and Proteus. Of all the causative organisms, 83.6% were eradicated in the 271 patients who could be evaluated. The other two studies were prospective, randomized comparisons of cefotaxime (392 patients) with cefazolin (250 patients) for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by microorganisms susceptible to both antibiotics. The treatment schedule was the same as that in the first study. Results of these two prospective studies were pooled. Cefotaxime eradicated 90% of all pathogens, and cefazolin eradicated 72%. Cefotaxime was significantly more effective (P less than 0.01) than cefazolin in eradicating E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. A satisfactory clinical response was obtained in 98.1% of patients given cefotaxime and in 87.6% of those given cefazolin (P less than 0.01).
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Synergistic activity of mecillinam in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam were combined with mecillinam. beta-Lactamase-containing Escherichia coli resistant to mecillinam was synergistically inhibited by both clavulanic acid and sulbactam. beta-Lactamase-containing Enterobacter was synergistically inhibited, but strains lacking beta-lactamases were not synergistically inhibited. Synergistic inhibition was noted for beta-lactamase-containing, mecillinam-resistant Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia, and Salmonella isolates, but only 18% of beta-lactamase-containing Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, and Morganella morganii were synergistically inhibited by the combinations.
TI  - [Studies in vivo and in vitro on relations between Schistosoma mansoni and some enterobacteria strains].
AB  - Studies performed in vivo and in vitro, using scanning electron microscopy, on relations between Schistosoma mansoni and some enterobacteria show a strong association for certain bacterial strains (Salmonella typhimurium). Salmonellae adhesion on tegumental surface of male and mature Schistosoma is only possible in vitro owing to bacterial synthesis of strong fibres penetrating inside the worm. These interactions are not found with Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis or with young schistosomula.
TI  - Impairment by Bacteroides species of opsonisation and phagocytosis of enterobacteria.
AB  - The ability of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes to phagocytose and kill Proteus mirabilis was impaired in vitro when the human serum, used to opsonise the target bacteria, was pretreated with cultures of various Bacteroides species. Live and dead, either heat-killed or clindamycin-treated, bacteroides cells elicited the same phenomenon. When bacteroides-treated serum was used to opsonise different Proteus species, the subsequent uptake of all strains by polymorphonuclear leucocytes was inhibited, whereas bacteroides-treated serum inhibited the uptake of some but not all of the test strains of Escherichia coli. The opsonic activity of untreated human serum was reduced when the classical complement pathway was inhibited by ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA); subsequent treatment with bacteroides did not further reduce the opsonic activity of the serum for P. mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.
TI  - [Treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal injuries].
AB  - Augmentin, a formulation of amoxycillin trihydrate 250 mg and sodium clavulanate  125 mg per tablet (A-CS) (Augmentin; Beecham), was used in treating 29 episodes of urinary tract infection occurring in 26 patients admitted to the Spinal Unit of the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital, Pretoria. Patients who had a urinary bacterial cell count of more than 105 of the same amoxycillin-resistant organism before and after the oral administration of amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 48 hours, received 2 A-CS 375 mg tablets orally, 3 times a day at the start if a meal for 5 days. The 29 strains of amoxycillin-resistant organisms treated in this study were: Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The bacteriological success rate 24 hours after therapy was 100% and 8 days after therapy 69%, dependent on patient management. In patients on free drainage and managed with condoms a bacteriological success rate of 55,5% was recorded and in patients managed by intermittent catheterization a bacteriological success rate of 75% was recorded. Side-effects were minimal; 1 patient complained of dizziness and no instances of nausea or vomiting were reported. Haematological, renal and hepatic monitoring before and after A-CS-therapy revealed no drug-related toxicity.
TI  - Determination of the range of antibacterial activity by use of viable counts.
AB  - The activity of three aminoglycosides and six beta-lactam antibiotics on strains  of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci was studied. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), and the minimal antibiotic concentrations (MACs) were determined after 5 h of incubation in broth cultures by colony-forming-unit counts. The MICs were also determined by agar dilution after 24 h of incubation. The MICs on agar after 24 h of incubation were higher than those in broth after 5 h of incubation. The differences ranged from 1.1- to 14.2-fold, but in most cases were only three- to fivefold (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). The MBCs at 5 and 24 h were comparable in 71% of tests. For current practice, the MBC of enterococci can be determined after 5 h of incubation with antibiotics. The aminoglycosides showed MBCs which were closer to the MICs than were those of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which required a higher multiple of the MIC to show a bactericidal effect. The MBCs of oxacillin and cefamandole for S. aureus after 5 h of incubation were greater than 128 times the respective MICs. The MACs ranged from 1/1.5 to 1/7 of the 5-h MICs. The three endpoints, MIC, MBC, and MAC, indicate the antibacterial range of an antibiotic in terms of inhibition of growth and bacterial survival. The data suggest that the antibacterial range of an antibiotic is similar for most strains of a given species and is, to some extent, a characteristic of similar antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - The radioactive thymidine incorporation method for the determination of antibiotic susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The thymidine incorporation method was compared with the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods for determining the antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli (233 strains), Proteus mirabilis (72 strains) and Klebsiella species (189 strains). The method measures changes in the rate of DNA synthesis of bacterial strains exposed to an antibiotic by comparing the amount of radioactive thymidine incorporated by these strains in relation to control strains. Good agreement was obtained between the results of the thymidine incorporation and disc diffusion methods for all antibiotics tested except streptomycin and tetracycline. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics determined by the thymidine incorporation method after 3 and 5 hours were generally lower than those obtained after 24 hours by the conventional broth dilution procedure. The thymidine incorporation method may be potentially useful for determining the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria a few hours after inoculation of a clinical specimen.
TI  - Rosanilins: indicator dyes for chloramphenicol-resistant enterobacteria containing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
AB  - Rosanilin dyes such as crystal violet and basic fuchsin have been used as indicator dyes in solid growth medium for chloramphenicol-resistant enterobacterial colonies containing the enterobacterial resistance enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). On certain media containing rosanilins, cells containing CAT formed darker colonies than cells not containing CAT. Contrast was affected by the types and concentrations of complex nutrients, sugars salts, and rosanilin dyes present. When crystal violet was used as the indicator dye, contrast could not be obtained for strains whose growth was partially inhibited by crystal violet. Contrast could not be obtained between yeast colonies with and without the enterobacterial resistance enzyme, between Bacillus subtilis colonies with and without the staphylococcal resistance enzyme, or between enterobacterial colonies with and without the staphylococcal resistance enzyme. The darker coloration of enterobacterial colonies with the enterobacterial enzyme was due to the binding of dye to enzyme. Rosanilin dues have been used to score resistance phenotypes by colony color, to detect chloramphenicol-sensitive sectors in chloramphenicol-resistant colonies, and to screen for occasional chloramphenicol-sensitive cells in a resistant population during cloning by insertional inactivation of the chloramphenicol resistance gene.
TI  - In vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-Pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  - Apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of Escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). Apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter diversus. Against Klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. The activity of apalcillin against Enterobacter (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, and E. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. The activity of apalcillin against Proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive Proteus and Providencia. Only 40% of Serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. Apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. It was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). There was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. Apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
TI  - The resistance of polyglycolic acid sutures to attack by infected human urine.
AB  - Polyglycolic acid sutures were incubated at 37 degrees C in broth, and in 0.22 mu millipore filtered human urine infected with Escherichia coli, Str. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At 3 days the Proteus had destroyed the polyglycolic acid sutures in the urine but not in the broth. None of the other organisms had any effect on the tensile strength of the suture material. Under the scanning electron microscope the Proteus-destroyed polyglycolic acid sutures showed multiple transverse microfractures. Polyglycolic acid sutures should not be used for closing urothelium in patients with a proven Proteus infection.
TI  - [The value of fosfomycin].
AB  - After description of the most important properties of fosfomycin including pharmacokinetics, antibacterial activity and hitherto got clinical experiences the determinations of the resistance on frequent clinical pathogenic agents are reported. They were performed in the diffusion test in a platelet content of 20 micrograms with admixture of glucose-6-phosphate. High sensitivity rates showed E. coli, P. mirabilis, hemophiliacs and above all Staph. aureus, but also a large part of the Klebsiella and the Pseudomonas strains could be classified as sensitive. Streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci mostly proved as resistant. Thus, in an oral therapy the spectre is smaller than in a highly dosed parenteral supply. Nevertheless, fosfomycin in the two forms of application is to be regarded as an enrichment of the therapeutic possibilities and further should be tested clinically.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of CENTA, a new beta-lactamase-susceptible chromogenic cephalosporin reagent.
AB  - CENTA is a newly synthesized, beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin reagent which changes color from light yellow (lambda maximum ca. 340 nm) to chrome yellow (lambda maximum ca. 405 nm) concomitant with hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. This compound offers promise as a diagnostic reagent comparable to other chromogens (PADAC and nitrocefin) for the early detection of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates, while retaining some antimicrobial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and non-enterococcal Streptococcus spp. CENTA is relatively unaffected by commonly used microbiological media and human serum.
TI  - Clinical value of sensitivity determinations in treating urinary tract infections.
AB  - The results of bacterial susceptibility testing in 2,413 urine specimens obtained from patients with urinary tract infections indicated that in a high percentage clinical response could be predicted without the need for antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Simply identifying the infecting organism will provide the clinician with enough information to treat most urinary tract infections intelligently. The relative effectiveness of antimicrobial agents to enable the proper selection of therapy in patients with urinary tract infections is discussed.
TI  - Analysis of the disagreement between automated bioluminescence-based and culture  methods for detecting significant bacteriuria, with proposals for standardizing evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.
AB  - A fully automated method for detecting significant bacteriuria is described which uses firefly luciferin and luciferase to detect bacterial ATP in urine. The automated method was calibrated and evaluated, using 308 urine specimens, against two reference culture methods. We obtained a specificity of 0.79 and sensitivity of 0.75 using a quantitative pour plate reference test and a specificity of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.90 using a semiquantitative standard loop reference test. The majority of specimens negative by the automated test but positive by the pour plate reference test were specimens which grew several bacterial species. We suggest that such disagreement was most likely for urine containing around 10(5) colony-forming units per ml (the culture threshold of positivity) and that these specimens were ones contaminated by urethral or vaginal flora. We propose standard procedures for calibrating and evaluating rapid or automated methods for the detection of significant bacteriuria and have analyzed our results using these procedures. We recommend that identical analyses should be reported for other evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide receptor on rabbit peritoneal macrophages. I. Binding characteristics.
AB  - The Bordetella pertussis endotoxin, labeled with tritium ((3H)-LPS), bound irreversibly and nonspecifically to rabbit lung macrophages, but bound reversibly and specifically to both resident and elicited rabbit peritoneal macrophages. The specific binding capacity of the macrophages was saturated with about 3 X 10(4) LPS molecules per cell. The binding was inhibited with the homologous unlabeled endotoxin, but not at all with endotoxin from Proteus mirabilis, thus assessing ligand specificity. Endotoxins from other bacteria gave intermediate inhibition value. Binding of tritium-labeled pertussis endotoxin was significantly inhibited by one of the two polysaccharides (PS-1) present in this endotoxin, but neither the other polysaccharide (PS-2) nor the Lipid A fragment exhibited such activity. These results strongly suggest the presence of a lectin-like receptor for LPS on the membrane of rabbit peritoneal macrophages.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefotiam against various pathogens isolated from clinical materials (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacteriological evaluation was made on cefotiam (CTM), a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, and the following results wer obtained. 1) CTM has shown very potent antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, Citrobacter intermedius, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus inconstans, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Pseudomonas putrefaciens. 2) Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter and Proteus morganii isolated from urine, Serratia and glucose non fermentative Gram-negative bacilli except Pseudomonas putrefaciens, were almost insusceptible to cefotiam.
TI  - Trimethoprim resistance in hospitals.
AB  - During November 1980 to April 1981, 1561 urinary tract pathogens were collected from Turku City Hospital, Turku University Central Hospital, and Kuopio University Central Hospital. Resistance of the strains was tested by agar-plate dilution against trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. Resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l) occurred in 8.6-12.2% of strains from the university hospitals (Pseudomonas excluded) and 38.3% of strains from Turku City Hospital. Resistance of Escherichia coli occurred in 4.1-6.2% of strains from the university hospitals and 21% of strains from Turku City Hospital. Proteus mirabilis was the most resistant of the clinically important bacterial species with resistance to trimethoprim in 29-78%. Attention is called for in defining the type of hospital used for a particular study: bacterial resistance in different hospitals cannot be compared direct and one hospital is not necessarily representative for a whole country. After seven years' use of plain trimethoprim the prevalence of resistance in the two university hospitals in Finland was similar to that in a London hospital just before plain trimethoprim was registered for use in Britain.
TI  - Laboratory surveillance of synergy between and resistance to trimethoprim and sulfonamides.
AB  - Results of susceptibility tests of Enterobacteriaceae isolated at 14 different centers demonstrate synergy between trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) against sulfonamide-susceptible isolates, which account for between less than 50% and greater than 75% of the isolates at different centers. Only 1%-4% of the isolates of Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis from the five centers in the United States were found to be resistant when tested with a disk containing both TMP and SMZ, but greater than 8% of such isolates from five of the other centers were resistant to the combination disk. A larger percentage of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Serratia marcescens were resistant, but the number varied from center to center. In the United States, resistance of human and animal isolates of Salmonella to the TMP-SMZ combination was almost completely absent, although greater than 50% of the animal isolates were resistant to sulfonamides. At a center that tested TMP and SMZ resistance with separate disks, resistance to TMP was found to be 30 times more common in sulfonamide-resistant than in sulfonamide-susceptible E. coli. This ratio may be useful as a monitor as treatment with TMP alone increases.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Interaction of escherichia coli RNA polymerase with the genome of Proteus mirabilis phage 5006M.
AB  
TI  - Interspecies recA protein substitution in Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - With the help of recombinant plasmids carrying the recA gene of Escherichia coli  or of Proteus mirabilis the ability of the recA gene products to substitute functionally for each other was studied. The recA protein of each can function in recombination, repair, induction of mutations and prophages and in regulation of its own synthesis within the foreign host nearly equally well as in the natural host. It is, therefore, suggested that recA-dependent processes act similarly in E. coli and P. mirabilis.
TI  - The peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of the Proteus mirabilis outer membrane: characterization of the peptidoglycan-associated region of PAL.
AB  - The peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) is present in the cell envelope in a form closely, but not covalently, associated with peptidoglycan in various Gram-negative bacteria. When the cell envelope or the isolated peptidoglycan-PAL complex from Proteus mirabilis, in which PAL maintains the interaction with peptidoglycan, was digested with trypsin, a polypeptide fragment with molecular weight 11,000 (11 K fragment) was obtained. However, when isolated PAL or the 11 K-fragment which had been dissociated from peptidoglycan was treated with trypsin, they were further digested. The 11 K-fragment maintained essentially the same tight interaction with peptidoglycan as intact PAL. These results indicate that the 11 K-fragment is probably derived from the peptidoglycan-associated region of the PAL molecule. The purified 11 K-fragment contained neither covalently-linked fatty acid nor glycerylcysteine, which are known to be present at the N-terminus of PAL. The N-terminal sequence of the 11 K-fragment was also determined.
TI  - Influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  - Sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Actinobacillus equuli, and Corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. When diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. pH values were recorded for each filtrate. Specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. All specimens were maintained at 25 degrees C in a water bath. Ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. The major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. From this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. The differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at P less than 0.01.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin potentially active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime were evaluated  against 700 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Ceftazidime was less active than penicillins or older cephalosporins against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis, Listeria, or anaerobic species. Ceftazidime was as active as ceftizoxime and moxalactam and more active than cefoperazone against Escherichia coli. Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than 0.2 mg/liter. Ceftazidime also inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella at concentrations below 0.2 mg/liter. Most Morganella, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus inconstans were inhibited at concentrations below 1 mg/liter, similar to the concentrations for moxalactam, ceftizoxime, and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the most active agent tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean minimal inhibitory concentration of 1.6 mg/liter. It inhibited carbenicillin-, piperacillin-, cefoperazone-, and cefsulodin-resistant Pseudomonas. Minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar, with the exception of some Pseudomonas values at 10(7) colony-forming units. Use of different media did not alter minimal inhibitory concentration values. Ceftazidime was not hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamase or plasmid beta-lactamase of the TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, OXA-1, PSE-1, PSE-2 types or by inducible beta-lactamases of the cephalosporinase type. Ceftazidime provides an extremely active agent against aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Inhibitors of bacterial urease: microbiological considerations on hydroxyurea influenza virus.
AB  - Hydroxyurea is a well known enzyme urease inhibitor. Bacteria strains producers of enzyme urease can be the cause of struvite calculosis. Clinical studies have shown that treatment with hydroxyurea can produce acid urine in patients suffering from struvite calculosis. In this work antiurease and antibacterial activity of hydroxyurea was valued in vitro against Proteus mirabilis strains. Our results seem not to agree with the ones obtained in vivo.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - Biochemistry and action of clavulanic acid.
AB  - The destruction of amoxycillin by beta-lactamase action represents an important mechanism of bacterial resistance to the drug. Data is presented to illustrate that clavulanic acid used in the form of its potassium salt inhibits the amoxycillin destroying action of many different types of beta-lactamase for example: the staphylococcal enzyme, the clinically important plasmid mediated enzymes of the TEM, SHV, OXA and PSE types and the chromosomally controlled enzymes produced by Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamases and potentiates the antibacterial action of amoxycillin are discussed.
TI  - [Serodiagnosis and the immunological aspects of Proteus infection. IV. Serum antibody level and the pathomorphological and bacteriological indices in experimental mixed and monoinfections of the urinary tract].
AB  - In developing the serodiagnosis of the Proteus infection of the urinary tract experimental hematogenic Proteus or Proteus-Escherichia pyelonephritis was reproduced. In this infection the time course, level and avidity of serum antibodies correlated with the isolation of the causative agents from urine samples used as seed material and with histological changes in the kidneys. The serological tests revealed high titres of H-antibodies and the presence of O-antibodies, while in cases of bacteriuria not accompanied by kidney lesions only H-antibodies in low titers were detected. The results obtained in the study of immune shifts can be used for etiological diagnosis and more exact localization of the pathological process in the urinary system.
TI  - Different binding specificities of P. mirabilis compared to E. coli.
AB  - The target cell specificities of P. mirabilis and E. coli strains were compared using human urinary tract epithelial cells and erythrocytes from human, guinea pig, sheep, ox and horse blood. P. mirabilis strains agglutinated the erythrocytes both in mannose-resistant and mannose-sensitive patterns. No relation was, however, found between hemagglutination and adhesion to uroepithelial cells. This is in contrast to E. coli where uroepithelial cell attachment is paralleled by mannose-resistant agglutination o human erythrocytes. The difference in receptor recognition between P, mirabilis and E. coli was further indicated by the fact that P. mirabilis strains attaching to human uroepithelial cells did not agglutinate guinea pig red cells coated with globotetraosylceramide, acting as a receptor for E. coli on human uroepithelial cells erythrocytes.
TI  - In vitro adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts.
AB  - The adherence of staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3H-thymidine to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. Adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. Enterobacteriaceae adhered to Dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. The addition of velour to the Dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. In contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. The adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. However, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.
TI  - Clinical study of mezlocillin for the treatment and prevention of postoperative obstetric and gynecological infections.
AB  - Twenty-one women were given mezlocillin for the treatment or prevention of infections after obstetric and gynecological surgery. Ten women had active infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Streptococcus faecalis. They had a 90% rate of recovery after an average of seven days of treatment with 6 to 15 gm/day of mezlocillin. The other 11 women were given mezlocillin prophylactically, 2 gm every 12 hours for seven days. All had good postoperative courses without complications caused by infections. Among both groups only three adverse reactions occurred, two instances of rash and one case of moderate diarrhea. All resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of treatment.
TI  - Cefotaxime treatment of skin and skin structure infections: a multicenter study.
AB  - The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefotaxime, a new parenteral cephalosporin resistant to beta-lactamase, were evaluated in a multicenter open trial. The study population comprised 594 hospitalized patients with infections of the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Of these, 409 patients fulfilled the protocol requirements for assessment of clinical efficacy. Usual dosages of cefotaxime were in the range of 1.5 to 12 gm/day for 5 to 85 days. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent gram-positive organism; Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most frequent gram-negative bacilli; and Peptococcus sp, the most frequent anaerobic organism isolated. Of the 409 evaluable patients, 382 (93.4%) were clinically cured. Bacteriological cures were obtained in 316 of 372 (84.9%) patients. Reactions to cefotaxime included asymptomatic eosinophilia, rash, drug fever, phlebitis, and elevated hepatic enzyme levels. All reactions were transient, and drug therapy had to be terminated in only eight patients. Cefotaxime proved effective for treating a variety of skin and soft tissue infections. The lack of serious toxicity and adverse reactions associated with cefotaxime, together with its broad antimicrobial spectrum, makes it a suitable substitute for aminoglycosides in certain clinical settings.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in complicated urinary infections failing to respond to conventional therapy.
AB  - Forty-three patients with a history of recurrent urinary infections, many of whom had renal involvement and had recently failed treatment, were then treated with pivmecillinam (400 mg 8-hourly for seven days). One week after the end of treatment the bacteriological cure rate was 72.1%. During the following four weeks, however, several of the cured patients relapsed, so that the cure rate five weeks after the end of treatment was only 46%. Thus, it is recommended that such patients should begin prophylactic treatment if found to be abacteriuric after the one week follow-up. Pivmecillinam was extremely well tolerated.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. In comparison with the other agents, MK 0787 was more or equally active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and Serratia spp. It inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against Proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against Beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to N-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.
TI  - Complementary activity of mezlocillin and the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid on Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The MICs of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and BRL 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2AM + 1CA), were measured for 331 Enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. The MIC values for mezlocillin and the combination 2AM + 1CA were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. When investigated separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2AM + 1CA (Escherichia coli and Shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2AM + 1CA (Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and indole-positive Proteus as well as strains of E. coli and Shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2AM + 1CA than to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant Salmonella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae). This complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2AM + 1CA against Enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.
TI  - An assessment of the intramuscular and intravenous administration of mezlocillin  in urinary tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy of mezlocillin in urinary tract infections was assessed using both the intramuscular and intravenous route. Patients with comparable diseases were divided into two groups. The microorganisms were sensitive to mezlocillin. Thirty patients were given i. m. doses and 20 i. v. doses. These patients had upper or lower urinary tract infections. The doses were 2 g i. v. or 1 g i. m. every eight hours. Treatment lasted for an average of six days. The MICs for mezlocillin were determined for the strains isolated, all of which were gram-negative organisms, with the exception of nine enterococci. In addition, sensitivity to cephalothin, carbenicillin and gentamicin was determined using the disc diffusion test. The geometric means of the MICs for mezlocillin were 3.85, 2.8 and 1.3 mg/l against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and enterococci, respectively. There were no marked differences in activity between the i. m. and i. v. routes on Days 1, 7, 14, 30 and 60 after treatment. There was a short-term cure rate of 79% with mezlocillin, independent of the route of administration; reinfections were observed in 8% of the cases and the infection persisted in 13%. There are no significant differences between our results and those from other studies on mezlocillin and piperacillin. There was no indication of toxicity, nor were there deviations in the haematological and biochemical parameters. One patient had severe pruritus following each i. m. injection; the treatment had to be discontinued.

TI  - Antimicrobial activities of daunorubicin and adriamycin derivatives on bacterial  and protoplast type L-form cells of Bacillus subtilis 170, Escherichia coli B, and Proteus mirabilis VI. Structure--activity relationship.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ten N-alkylated derivatives of daunorubicin and adriamycin as well as of 5-iminodaunorubicin has been tested by using Bacillus subtilis 170, Escherichia coli B, and Proteus mirabilis VI and their stable protoplast type L-forms in an agar diffusion test. Eight of the substances showed similar activities against B. subtilis and the L-forms of all test organisms, but no activity against the bacterial forms of E. coli and P. mirabilis. The cell wall of these gram-negative bacteria is responsible for this resistance by not allowing the antibiotics to enter the cells. The piperidino compound N-(CH2)5 daunorubicin shows 2-4 times higher activity against B. subtilis and all L-forms in comparison to daunorubicin and the other derivatives. Five of the substances were inactive against all test strains. Their inactivity seems to be associated with the larger substituents at the C-3' position. Relations between molecular structure and activity are discussed considering data about the interaction with DNA and the antitumor activity. Stable protoplast type L-forms and their bacterial forms represent a suitable and effective test system to screen for more effective substances and to get more information about their mode of action.
TI  - The inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  - The beta-lactamase from Klebsiella pneumoniae E70 behaved in a similar fashion to the TEM-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. Both enzymes produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. In the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for TEM-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for Klebsiella beta-lactamase. Biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. This decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. This cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. A 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of TEM-2 beta-lactamase. Hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. The stoichiometry of the interaction with Klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. The penicillinase from Proteus mirabilis C889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. The major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. The cephalosporinase from Enterobacter cloacae P99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C). No irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. The rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with Proteus and Enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid pH.
TI  - Gram-negative, aerobic, enteric pathogens among intestinal microflora of wild turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) in west central Texas.
AB  - The prevalence of gram-negative bacterial species in the intestines of 20 apparently healthy turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) was determined. Edwardsiella tarda, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella, and Arizona hinshawii (Salmonella arizonae) were each recovered from 15% of these birds. Turkey vultures may be important reservoirs of these bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Results of urinalysis and bacterial culture of urine specimens obtained during midstream voiding, by catheterization, and by cystocentesis were studied in 50 clinically normal dogs (25 females and 25 males). All of the specimens obtained by cystocentesis were bacteriologically sterile. Bacterial growth occurred in 26% of the catheterized specimens and in 85% of the voided specimens. The proportion of positive urine cultures from catheterized and voided specimens was higher for females than for males. Results or urinalysis did not correlate well with results of bacterial culture.
TI  - An evaluation of tests using DNA repair-deficient bacteria for predicting genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. A report of the U.S. EPA's Gene-TOX Program.
AB  - The detection of DNA-damaging agents by repair-deficient bacterial assays is based on the differential inhibition of growth of repair-proficient and repair-deficient bacterial pairs. The various methodologies used are described and recommendations are made for their improved use. In a survey of the literature through April 1979, 91 of 276 papers evaluated contained usable data, resulting in an analysis of 611 compounds that had been assayed in 1 or more of 55 pairs of repair-proficient and repair-deficient strains. The results indicate that (1) a liquid suspension assay is more sensitive than a spot (diffusion) test. In a review of the Escherichia coli polA assay, 45 compounds that gave "No Test" in the spot test were clearly positive or negative in the liquid suspension assay. (2) Of the 21 compounds analyzed by the E. coli polA assay and by other E. coli repair-deficient strains (e.g., rec, uvr, hcr, and exr derivatives of WP2 and AB1157), 10 were in complete agreement in all strains except uvrA strains. This indicates that strains other than polA+/polA- are useful for detecting DNA-damaging agents. However, in selecting strains for use in these assays, care should be taken to consider repair pathway specificity for particular compounds. (3) There was a 78% correspondence between results obtained with E. coli polA and Bacillus subtilis (H17/M45, 17A/45T) rec assay and between E. coli polA and Proteus mirabilis. (4) In a comparison of test results with carcinogenicity data, 44 of 71 (62%) carcinogenic compounds assayed by the polA system were positive, 10 (14%) were negative, and 17 (24%) gave No Test or doubtful results. 7 carcinogens were assayed by other E. coli strains and all were positive. 56 carcinogens were assayed in B. subtilis: 24 (43%) were positive, 9 (16%) were negative, and 23 (41%) gave No Test or doubtful results. Of the 7 carcinogens assayed in P. mirabilis, 6 (86%) were positive and 1 (14%) was negative. (5) The results were analyzed with respect to chemical classes. E. coli polA detected the highest percentage of hydroxylamines and alkyl epoxides. The B. subtilis rec assay detected the highest percentage of nitrosamines and sulfur and nitrogen oxides. It is concluded that some of these test systems are effective tools for the detection of DNA-damaging and potentially carcinogenic compounds, especially if the assay is done in liquid suspension and if more than 1 pair of tester strains is used. Advantages and disadvantages of the assay are discussed and suggestions are made for improvements in the system.

AB  - Amoxicillin (AMPC), a synthetic penicillin for oral use, was studied in the aspect of in vitro antibacterial efficiencies brought about by different schedules of AMPC-treatment. Using Proteus mirabilis IID-994 and Escherichia coli NIHJ JC-2 as test strains. The results were obtained as follows. 1. The antibacterial effects of AMPC against P. mirabilis IID-994 and E. coli NIHJ JC-2 were shown to be bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and the numbers of viable cells were decreased in proportion to the length of exposing time to AMPC. 2. The decrease of viable cells was independent on the drug at which level concentration we tested, namely, it was not much changed by the level of AMPC at least among 1 to 4 times of minimal inhibitory concentration. 3. The length of time retaining growth-inhibitory ability was longer in the case of treating continuously for 4 hours than that of contacting twice for 2 hours at intervals of 6 hours, although the levels of viable cells after 12 hours incubation were almost same in both cases. 4. The level of bactericidal effect and the length of growth-inhibitory time were proportional to the length of exposing time to AMPC.
TI  - Clinical laboratory evaluation of the automicrobic system Enterobacteriaceae biochemical card.
AB  - The AutoMicrobic System Enterobacteriaceae Biochemical Card (AMS-EBC; Vitek Systems, Inc.) was evaluated in two clinical microbiology laboratories. A total of 502 consecutive clinical isolates representing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested in parallel with the AMS-EBC, API 20E, and Enterotube II systems. Discrepancies between systems were resolved with the conventional methods of Edwards and Ewing (P. R. Edwards and W. H. Ewing [ed.], Identification of Enterobacteriaceae, 1972) and Ewing and Martin (W. H. Ewing and W. J. Martin, in Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 1974) AMS-EBC correctly identified 96.6% and incorrectly identified 3.4% of the isolates. When 12 or more isolates of a species were evaluated, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae posed the greatest challenge to the systems, with 92.6, 95.2, and 95.3%, respectively, being correctly identified. To confirm the accuracy of identification when all systems agreed, 93 randomly selected isolates were identified by conventional methods. The percent agreement was 100%. The reproducibility of triplicate determinations on 93 randomly selected isolates with the AMS-EBC was 99.6%. The AMS-EBC was found to be an easy, rapid, and accurate method for identification of Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - [Comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activity of MX in comparison with those of other CEPs, using aerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. Against Streptococcus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM and CTM. Against H. influenzae, CMX also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMX, CXM, CTM and CEZ. ABPC-and PIPC-resistant strains were sensitive to CMX. CTX, CPZ and CZX also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of CMX. Against enteric bacteria, E. coli, Klebsiella, E. cloacae, Serratia, C. freundii and Proteus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM, CTM and CEZ. Especially, against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity. As to non-fermentation bacteria, CMX's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except P. putrefaciens, Alcaligenes and Comamonas. However, it was superior than that of CEZ. In comparison with other CEPs, the strength of CMX varied according to the kinds of bacteria. As to anaerobic bacteria, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, C. perfringens, Veillonella and Fusobacterium. However, its antibacterial activity against Bacteroides was similar to those of other CEPs.
TI  - Phage t: a group T plasmid-dependent bacteriophage.
AB  - Phage t was isolated from sewage from Pretoria. It formed plaques only on Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains that carried plasmids belonging to incompatibility group T. Five of six group T plasmids permitted visible lysis of R+ host strains. There was no visible lysis of E. coli J53-2 or S. typhimurium LT2trpA8 carrying the T plasmid Rts1 although the strains supported phage growth as indicated by at least a 10-fold increase in phage titre. The latter strains transferred the plasmid at high frequency to E. coli strain CSH2 and the resulting transconjugants plated the phage. Proteus mirabilis strain PM5006(R402) failed to support phage growth although it transferred the plasmid and concomitant phage sensitivity to E. coli J53-2. The phage was hexagonal in outline, RNA-containing, resistant to chloroform and adsorbed to the shafts of pili determined by T plasmids.
TI  - Phage X: a plasmid-dependent, broad host range, filamentous bacterial virus.
AB  - Phage X was isolated from sewage as plating on Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium strains harbouring the incompatibility group X plasmid R6K. It also plated on a strain of Serratia marcescens carrying this plasmid. It failed to form plaques on Proteus mirabilis, P. morganii or Providencia alcalifaciens harbouring R6K, but did multiply on them. No phage increase occurred with homologous R- strains. Phage X also plated or registered an increase in titre on E. coli or S. typhimurium strains carrying various plasmids of incompatibility groups M, N, P-1, U or W as well as the unassigned plasmid R775. It adsorbed to pili determined by a group P-10 plasmid in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain but did not multiply on this organism. The phage was filamentous and curly, resistant to ribonuclease and diethyl ether and sensitive to chloroform. It adsorbed to the tips of pili.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ceftazidime, a beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime were evaluated  against 700 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ceftazidime was less active than penicillins or older cephalosporins against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and it did not inhibit Streptococcusfaecalis. However, ceftazidime was as active as moxalactam and cefoperazone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis with MICs less than 0.2 mg/l. Ceftazidime also inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella and Shigella at concentrations below 0.2 mg/l. Most Morganella, Pr. rettgeri, Pr. vulgaris and Pr. inconstans were inhibited at concentrations below 1 mg/l similar to concentrations for moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the most active agent tested against Ps. aeruginosa, with a mean MIC of 1.6 mg/l. It inhibited carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefsulodin resistant Pseudomonas.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with the activities of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefuroxime, cephalothin and cefatriaxon against 331 clinical bacterial isolates. Against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus ceftazidime, with MIC90 of < or = 0.25 mg/l, was more active than cephalothin, cefoperazone and cefuroxime but less active than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were inhibited at higher concentrations (MIC90 1-4 mg/l). The activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MIC90 of 4 mg/l) was four times that of cefoperazone, five times that of cefatriaxon and ten times that of cefotaxime, but similar to that of cefsulodin. Against Staphylococcus aureus and Lancefield groups A and B streptococci ceftazidime was less active than the other cephalosporins. Group D streptococci were resistant. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/l. There were no significant inoculum effects on ceftazidime and MBCs were within one twofold dilution of MICs. The addition of 50% human serum had no effect on MICs and MBCs.

AB  - UK-38,006, 6 beta-iodopenicillanic acid, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamase enzymes. It potentiated the antibacterial action of ampicillin in vitro against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and many Enterobacteriaceae. This ability to synergize with ampicillin was also demonstrated in vivo after oral administration of UK-38,006 to experimentally infected mice. UK-38,006 was also shown to synergize in vitro with other penicillins and cephalosporins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella species.
TI  - Cloning of a recA-like gene of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A gene of Proteus mirabilis that can substitute for functions of the recA gene of Escherichia coli has been cloned into the plasmid pBR322, using shotgun experiments. The recA-like gene (recAp.m.) has been localized by restriction mapping within a 1.5-Md PstI fragment that is a part of two cloned HindIII fragments of the chromosome of P. mirabilis. The restriction map of the recAp.m. gene differs from that of the recA gene of E. coli. Functionally, the recombinant plasmids containing the recAp.m. gene restore a nearly wild-type level of UV-resistance to several point and deletion mutants in the recA gene of E. coli.
TI  - Application of an improved methodology to demonstrate bacterial adherence during  the menstrual cycle.
AB  - We studied bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells of female patients in relation to the menstrual cycle. We determined the number of bacteria demonstrable on native cells and the number of adhering bacteria after incubation with E. coli. Free bacteria and uroepithelial cells with adhering bacteria were optimally separated by differential centrifugation using sodium metrizoate (9.6%) and dextran (5.6%) (Lymphoprep). Thus, contamination of the cell preparation by free (non-adhering) bacteria was avoided and results were well reproducible. A median of five bacteria/cell (range 0-19) was observed for uroepithelial cells obtained from urine of female patients. Such bacteria were mostly rods. After in vitro incubation with E. coli cultures, a median of 33 bacteria/cell (range 17-54) was counted. Our improved methodology failed to demonstrate a relationship between bacterial adhesion and the menstrual cycle.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  - Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. Cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although cefotiam was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Phosphate localization in carbohydrates - a study on enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The localization of the phosphate substituents in the core oligosaccharide of the lipopolysaccharides of Enterobacteriaceae has been reported for Salmonella minnesota and Escherichia coli B only. In these cases the localizations were done by a beta-elimination reaction in mild alkaline solution after periodate oxidation. We report now on a method generally applicable on carbohydrates. The localization of phosphate groups and the extent of substitution with phosphate residues in carbohydrates can be determined by the following reaction sequence: methylation, dephosphorylation, and reetherification (labelling) with C2H3J or C2H5J followed by derivatizing to partially methylated alditol acetates and analysis by combined gas liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results presented here are obtained by application of this method to isolated core oligosaccharides of lipopolysaccharides from E. coli C23.1, E. coli C71, E. coli F2515, and P. mirabilis R4/O 28. Phosphate is localized at C-4 of the chain heptoses in the lipopolysaccharides of E. coli C and E. coli R4, and at C-7 of the branching heptose in the lipopolysaccharide of P. mirabilis R4/O 28.
TI  - Listeria and gram-negative bacillary meningitis in New York City, 1972-1979. Frequent causes of meningitis in adults.
AB  - In an eight year period (1972-1979), 158 cases of enteric gram-negative bacillary meningitis and 53 cases of Listeria meningitis were reported to the New York City Health Department. These two forms of bacterial meningitis were the fourth and fifth most common ones reported to the Department, respectively. The cumulative total of reported cases of gram-negative rod meningitis over this less than the reported cases due to Neisseria meningitis over this period. In contrast to most previous studies of Listeria and enteric gram-negative meningitides, the majority of cases occurred in adults. Listeria meningitis occurred more often in immunosuppressed hosts and the elderly than in the newborn; gram-negative bacillary meningitides were seen more often in elderly septic patients and in patients with traumatic skull fracture than in infants during the first months of life. The over-all mortality of Listeria meningitis was 62 percent; that of the combined gram-negative meningitides 71.3 percent. The mortality in adults with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella meningitis who were treated with chloramphenicol as the major antibiotic was 83 percent. In comparison, the only appreciable survival rates noted were in those with Listeria, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella meningitis who were treated with ampicillin alone in whom the over-all mortality was 51 percent.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of FR-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of FR-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(N-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The in vitro activity of FR-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR-31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter. It was less active than fosfomycin against Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. FR-31564 inhibited a number of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. In the presence and absence of human blood FR-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and P. aeruginosa exposed to FR-31564 for 3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. FR-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with P. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. It was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with E. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

TI  - Sulfazecin, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic of bacterial origin. Isolation and chemical characterization.
AB  - Sulfazecin, a new water-soluble acidic antibiotic, which is active against Gram-negative bacteria, was isolated as crystals from the culture broth of Pseudomonas acidophila G-6302 by use of anion exchange resin and activated charcoal. The molecular formula of sulfazecin was determined to be C12H20N4O9S from physicochemical data. The IR and NMR spectra suggested that this antibiotic has a beta-lactam ring, methoxyl and sulfonate groups. On acidic hydrolysis it gave D-alanine and D-glutamic acid. These chemical and physicochemical data indicated that sulfazecin is a new beta-lactam antibiotic.
TI  - Effect of combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam.
AB  - The effect of cefsulodin in combination with mecillinam was examined against a wide range of bacterial species. The antibacterial spectrum was widened by the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam in the ratio of 5:1 and 10:1. In overall observations, in the in vitro test, a synergistic effect against clinical isolates was found on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, and an additive effect was found on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus inconstans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In in vivo tests, a synergistic effect was observed on S. marcescens TN 66 and K. pneumoniae DT infections and an additive effect was observed on S. aureus 308 A-1, E. coli O-111 and T-7, C. freundii TN 518, E. cloacae TN 603, P. vulgaris GN 4712, P. morganii Tn 373 and P. aeruginosa U 31 infections.
TI  - Acquired cross resistance to aminoglycosides in gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant strains of enterobacteria.
AB  - The development of non-specific resistance ot gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin was studied in 12 clinical isolates of enterobacteria with various patterns of aminoglycoside resistance. Strains were characterised with respect to MIC, transferability of resistance and possession of acetylating and adenylylating enzymes. An increase in aminoglycoside resistance was induced in 10 strains by a single exposure to the concentration of gentamicin, tobramycin or amikacin immediately below the MIC. Such resistance was non-specific; all three aminoglycosides were affected irrespective of which one had been used to induce the increase. Increments in non-specific aminoglycoside resistance were also evoked by exposure of enterobacteria to changing drug concentrations similar to those achieved in plasma during therapy. When strains already resistant to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides were exposed to therapeutically achievable drug concentrations, no further increase in resistance was observed in most cases. This suggests that use of an aminoglycoside to which the organism is resistant, as during "blind" therapy, will not usually compromise subsequent treatment with related antibiotics. The possible relevance of non-specific aminoglycoside resistance to therapy is discussed.
TI  - Structure of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of the Proteus mirabilis outer membrane. II. Sequence of the amino-terminal part of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein.
AB  - The amino acid of the lipooligopeptide (LOP) derived from the N-terminal region of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of Proteus mirabilis was determined to be [X]-Ser-Ser-Asn-Lys. An unidentified compound[X] present at the N-terminus was identified as glycerylcysteine [S-(propane-2,'3'-diol)-3-thio, 2-amino-propanoic acid]. The partial amino acid sequence of the lipopolypeptide (LPP), which contained the lipooligopeptide (LOP) at its N-terminal part, was also determined, mainly by Edman-degradation. The structure of the N-terminal part of PAL was determined to be [3 Fatty acids approximately glycerylcysteine-Ser-Ser-Asn-Lys-Asn-Asp-Asp-Glu-Thr-Asp-Thr-Ser...]. The structure of PAL is discussed in comparison with Braun's lipoprotein.
TI  - Structure of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of the Proteus mirabilis outer membrane. I. Isolation and characterization of fatty acid-containing peptides from PAL.
AB  - In the outer membrane of P. mirabilis, a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of apparent molecular weight 18,000 is present as a major protein. A fatty acid-containing polypeptide (lipopolypeptide; LPP) was isolated by digestion of the purified PAL with trypsin in the presence of 0.05% SDS. It was composed of 31 amino acid residues, an unidentified compound[X], and ca. 3 fatty acid residues. A lipooligopeptide (LOP) was also isolated after further digestion of LPP with trypsin in the absence of SDS. LOP was composed of 4 amino acid residues (Asx, 2Ser, Lys), a compound[X], and ca. 3 fatty acid residues. The C-terminal amino acids of LPP and LOP were determined as arginine and lysine, respectively. On the other hand, the N-terminus of PAL, LPP, or LOP could not be identified by conventional N-terminal analysis of PAL, LPP, or LOP could not be identified by conventional N-terminal analysis, indicating that the N-terminus is probably masked. These results indicate that LPP and LOP are derived from the fatty-attached amino terminal region of PAL.
TI  - Resistance to trimethoprim in 1978-79 compared with 1973-75.
AB  - The incidence of resistance to trimethoprim among urinary isolates between October 1978 and November 1979 was 11.5%, more than double the figure found April 1973 and October 1975. Of the resistant strains, 60% had a minimum inhibitory concentration in excess of 1 mg/ml. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis showed the greatest increase in resistance since the previous study. Rather wide fluctuations occurred in the incidence of resistance for various species when the figures were analysed over two-month periods, hence studies of short duration must be interpreted with caution. There are not yet enough data from this or other studies for the cause of the increased incidence of resistance to trimethoprim to be determined.
TI  - Role of urease in the formation of infection stones: comparison of ureases from different sources.
AB  - Bacterial and vegetable ureases were found to differ in certain important respects. For maximal clinical relevance, in vitro studies on the pathogenic role of urease should use whole bacterial cells of Proteus spp., and urease inhibitors should be assessed without preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor. Urease from Proteus morganii was very different from ureases of other species of Proteus; this factor should be taken into account when infections with P. morganii are being treated.
TI  - Investigation into the antibacterial activity in vitro of cement-antibiotic mixtures.
AB  - An investigation was made into the antibacterial activity in vitro of CMW cement  and antibiotic mixtures. The results of this study are reported and the risk factors are discussed. On the basis of our studies, the use of this mixture in clinical practice would appear to be premature.
TI  - A novel peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) found in the outer membrane of Proteus mirabilis and other Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A novel peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) was found in the cell envelope of Proteus mirabilis. This protein showed the following properties: (1) The apparent molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel was 18,000. (2) The protein was present in the cell envelope in a form very closely, but not covalently, associated with the peptidoglycan layer. (3) The protein was recovered predominantly from the outer membrane fraction after separation of the cell envelopes. (4) [1-14C]Palmitic acid and [2-3H]glycerol were incorporated into the protein. (5) The protein contained covalently linked fatty acids (about 3 mol of fatty acid per mol of protein). (6) An unidentified compound was present in the hydrolysate of the protein. These properties, except for molecular weight and non-covalent association with the peptidoglycan, showed resemblance to those of Braun's lipoprotein. However the protein was distinct from Braun's lipoprotein in regard to amino acid composition. A similar peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) was present widely in the cell envelopes of various Gram-negative bacteria. P. mirabilis contains about twelve times as much PAL as Escherichia coli. Antiserum against PAL of P. mirabilis was cross-reactive against PAL of E. coli, but not against Braun's lipoprotein of E. coli.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial effects of combinations of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The effects of combining the new broad-spectrum penicillins piperacillin and mezlocillin with cefoxitin, cefamandole, or cephalothin on the antibacterial activities of these antibodies were determined in vitro against 50 to 109 bacterial strains and in six experimental infections in mice. Against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus, the combinations exhibited synergistic, indifferent, or additive effects, but no antagonism. Against strains of four groups of organisms (Pseudomonas, Serratia, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus), a high incidence of antagonism was observed, particularly with combinations containing cefoxitin (60 to 100%). The penicillins were antagonized by the cephalosporin antibiotics. In vitro effects were reflected in vivo. Mice infected with cultures associated with synergistic or additive in vitro effects were protected with lower doses of piperacillin when this antibiotic was administered with ineffective doses of cefoxitin than when piperacillin was used alone. Infections with cultures associated with in vitro antagonism required two- to eightfold higher doses of piperacillin and mezlocillin when these antibiotics were used in combination with the cephalosporins. The clinical implications of these effects should be considered.
TI  - [Utilization and fermentation of 2-ketogluconate by "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Two methods were compared: 1) the ability to use 2-ketogluconate (2-KG) as source of carbon and energy in defined medium, and 2) the ability to produce acid by fermentation of 2-KG (0.5 g/100 ml) in peptone water with phenol red. Results of growth on, and acid production from, 2-KG were identical. A total of 990 strains was studied. No strain of Escherichia coli, Shigella (4 species), Salmonella (4 sub-genera), Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Edwardsiella (2 species), Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, Providencia (2 species) could utilize 2-KG. All strains of Citrobacter (2 species), Levinea amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter (5 species), Serratia (6 species) utilize 2-KG as sole carbon source. Different reactions were given by strains of P. rettgeri, Y. enterocolitica and K. rhinoscleromatis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Cefotaxime CSF levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - A comparison of cefaclor versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination in the  treatment of acute urinary infections.
AB  - Acute lower urinary tract infections were treated in 57 women according to a randomized protocol, using either cefaclor, a cephalosporin whose chemical structure is similar to that of cephalexin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. Urine cultures were made before treatment was started, midway through the 10-day course of therapy, 1 week after therapy and 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, if possible. Urine cultures in 100 per cent of the patients became sterile during therapy and remained so 1 week after therapy. Of those patients undergoing followup cultures 4 to 6 weeks after therapy 98 per cent had sterile urine. Twenty-nine patients were randomized to cefaclor therapy and 28 received a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. There was no difference between the 2 drugs studied in terms of efficacy. No side effects were noted with cefaclor and 2 minor side effects were noted with the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. Cefaclor in a twice daily dosage schedule appears to be a safe and useful drug in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the common gram-negative organisms and it appears to be as efficacious as the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination.
TI  - Phage C-1: an IncC group; plasmid-specific phage.
AB  - A phage was isolated from sewage and shown to form plaques on Salmonella typhimurium strains carrying C plasmids. It failed to multiply on strains lacking plasmids of this group. It also plated on Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens strains carrying various IncC plasmids but failed to form plaques on Escherichia coli strains harbouring most of these plasmids, although in all cases, phage multiplication on the strains was demonstrated. No phage increase occurred in any of the strains which lacked an IncC plasmid or contained plasmids of other incompatibility groups. The phage is small, hexagonal in outline, contains RNA, is resistant to chloroform and adsorbs to the shafts of pili coded for by IncC plasmids.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin against 7,312  clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin was tested against 7,312  clinical isolates of aerobic pathogens. Cefoxitin was found to have a broad spectrum of activity. Among the gram-positive cocci, 99.1% of Staphylococcus aureus, 94.4% of Staphylococcus epidermidis and 98.1% of streptococci group B had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 microgram/ml or less, while only 4.6% of enterococci were sensitive to this concentration of cefoxitin. Among the gram-negative rods 94.4% of Escherichia coli, 89.3% of Klebsiella spp., 97.3% of Proteus mirabilis, 97.4% of Proteus vulgaris and 79.3% of Proteus morganii were sensitive to 16 microgram/ml of cefoxitin or less. The effect of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was negligible. Cefoxitin was less active than cephalothin against gram-positive cocci, the difference being most pronounced against enterococci. Cephalothin was also found to be more active than cefoxitin against P. mirabilis, while cefoxitin was superior to cephalothin against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., P. vulgaris and P. morganii.
TI  - Papillary necrosis in vitro: a scanning electron microscopic comparison of escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis infection.
AB  - The effect of bacterial infection on excised renal papillae as a model for papillary necrosis and subsequent calcification was investigated. Sterile rat renal papillae were placed in 25 ml aliquots of filter sterilized human urine and then inoculated with one ml suspensions of sterilized human urine and then inoculated with one ml suspensions of sterile saline as a control, or 1 x 108/ml Escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis. After incubation at 37 degrees C for periods of 8 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, 1 wk, 2 wk and 3 wk, urinary pH was measured, bacterial culture performed and the renal papillae were recovered and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrophotometry (EDS). In the case of Proteus mirabilis, the sequence of events noted included bacterial-papillary interactions consisting of cell desquamation and strand formation, despite infrequent bacterial attachment. After 10 hr, a rapid, urease induced pH rise resulted in calcium salt deposition on the papillae surface. Organism death was apparent after 72 hr. Escherichia coli infected papillae demonstrated similar cell surface changes after a 8 hr as seen in P. mirabilis; however, frequent evidence of bacterial attachment and penetration was apparent. Bacterial attachment was a prominent feature throughout the incubation period with E. coli. After one week, rare areas of degenerating cells and bacteria with increased calcium levels as compared to surrounding areas were noted by EDS analysis. Urinary pH was stable throughout the incubation period. This study suggests varied roles for the organisms most associated with infection induced papillary necrosis (E coli) and papillary necrosis with subsequent stone formation (P. mirabilis). A role for bacterial calcification in the absence of bacterial urease activity by E. coli is also suggested.
TI  - Serum antibodies against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis after different types of operations.
AB  - The serum antibody titer against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis before and after different types of operations was studied in 105 adult patients. The different operations were: pyelo- or ureterolithotomi (32); ileal conduit urinary diversion (20); cholecystectomi (34); operation in the thyroid area (10); operation of varicose veins of the legs (9); and colectomies (10). High serum antibody titers against E. coli were found in 16% of the patients preoperatively. Antibody titres against P. mirabilis were high in 19% of the patients with urinary tract calculus but in none of those without urological disease. The antibody titre against E. coli and/or P. mirabilis increased significantly more often after operation in the urinary tract or colon than after the other operations. Increase of antibody titers were more often seen in patients who preoperatively had normal titres. A normalization of the titers was seen during the following 12 months and in most of those patients within the first 3 months.
TI  - A new look at the aetiology of urinary infection.
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Ro 13-9904 and preliminary experience in gonorrhoea and chronic urinary tract infections.
AB  - Ro 13-9904, a new broad-spectrum, beta-lactamase-resistant, cephalosporin, was given as a single i.m. injection at doses of 500, 250, and 125 mg in 3 groups of male patients each consisting of 10, 6, and 6 patients respectively, suffering from uncomplicated acute but recurrent gonococcal urethritis. All patients were cured both clinically and bacteriologically without relapsing after a 7-day follow-up. 11 patients suffering from chronic urinary tract infections without flow obstruction but with underlying chronic pyelonephritis in 6, were treated for 7 days with 500 mg of Ro 13-9904 i.m., every 12 h. E. coli and P. mirabilis were the main isolated pathogens. Treatment was successful in all with only one bacteriological relapse during the follow-up period. The drug's tolerance was satisfactory except for moderate local pain in most of the patients.
TI  - Bacteriological and serological studies after ileovesical diversion in dogs.
AB  - The risk of urinary tract infection after ileovesical diversion was studied by means of bacteriological and serological analyses in 8 mongrel dogs. Cultures of bladder contents showed heavy growth of the same bacterial strains as were found in the distal ileum. Cultures of the pelvic urine contained lower amounts of the same strains of bacteria. The levels of serum antibody titres to Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were elevated only in 3 out of 100 sera examined. These slightly increased titres were not related to any obvious infection in the urinary tract. High C-reactive protein concentrations were noted in 3 dogs in connection with diagnosed inflammatory conditions. Colonization of the urinary tract after oral administration of selected test-strains could not be shown.
TI  - Hemagglutination of human type O erythrocytes, hemolysin production, and serogrouping of Escherichia coli isolates from patients with acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study potential virulence factors associated with Escherichia coli urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection. These factors were compared with characteristics of normal-flora E. coli isolated from stool specimens of healthy individuals without a history of urinary tract infection. The potential virulence factor focused on in this study was hemagglutination (HA) of human type O erythrocytes by E. coli urinary pathogens. A total of 265 strains of E. coli isolated from patients with urinary tract infections were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate human type O erythrocytes; of these, 148 (56%) were HA positive. Only 6 of 36 fecal E. coli strains (17%) isolated from healthy controls were HA positive. This significant association of the presence of hemagglutinin on E. coli that causes urinary tract infections indicates the likelihood that HA is a marker of virulence. Only 12% (5 of 43) of Proteus mirabilis and 3% (3 of 104) of Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary isolates were HA positive. There was a trend for HA-positive E. coli to be isolated from patients with kidney infections and positive tests for antibody-coated bacteria rather than bladder infections and negative tests for antibody-coated bacteria, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation (P < 0.025) between hemolysin production and HA; 67% (69 of 103) of the isolates that produced hemolysin also hemagglutinated human type O erythrocytes. There was no significant correlation between HA and motility, although there was a trend for flagellated organisms to be non-hemagglutinators. There was a marked correlation between the presence of hemagglutinin and the serogroup of the E. coli isolate; serogroups O4, O7, and O50 were almost always HA positive (57 of 63; 90%). In contrast, serogroups O8 and O25 were rarely HA positive (2 of 30; 7%).
TI  - Evaluation of cefaclor.
AB  - The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, bacterial spectrum, clinical use,  dosage, adverse reactions, and dosage forms and cost of cefaclor are reviewed. Cefaclor, a congener of cephalexin monohydrate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic. It is well absorbed when given orally on an empty stomach; absorption is delayed by the presence of food. Although metabolism may play a role in the disposition of cefaclor, elimination is primarily renal. Cefaclor's spectrum of activity is similar to that of cefalexin, including a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; in particular, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Haemophilus influenzae are more susceptible to clinically achievable concentrations of cefaclor than cephalexin. Cefaclor has been demonstrated to be effective against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae resistant to ampicillin, but further studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of this activity. Efficacy of cefaclor has been demonstrated in urinary tract, upper and lower respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue infections in adults and children as well as in pediatric otitis media. Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, are generally mild and occur in few patients. Usual doses are 250-500 mg every eight hours in adults and 20--40 mg/kg/day in children, although this pediatric dose may be two low for otitis media. Clinical superiority of cefaclor over less expensive antibiotics has not been demonstrated.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Preoperative treatment with azlocillin in complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Eighteen patients, aged 18-84 years, with complicated urinary tract infections admitted to hospital were treated preoperatively with azlocillin (Securopen) for 5 to 10 days. Two patients having chronic pyelonephritis were not operated. Isolates bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Escherichia coli (2) and Klebsiella spp. (1). Serum concentrations and urine recovery were measured on the fifth day of treatment. The mean serum half-life was 1.85 h and the mean value of the urine recovery 47% of the single dose. On the 5th day of treatment the urine was sterile in 80% of the patients. In 12 patients (60%) the urine was still sterile when controlled 2-6 months after operation and prophylactic postoperative treatment with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Some observations on the activity of three antiseptics used as bladder irrigants  in the treatment of urinary tract infection in patients with indwelling catheters.
AB  - A comparison has been made of the activity of three antiseptics that are used as  bladder irrigants in the treatment of urinary tract infection in catheterised patients. At the concentrations and exposure times used for bladder irrigation, phenoxyethanol (2:4% v/v) proved to be highly bactericidal against urine-grown cells of all the common urinary pathogens tested. Chlorhexidine (200 microgram/ml) was active against Escherichia coli and produced significant reductions in the viability of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but failed to eradicate Providencia stuartii. Exposure to noxythiolin (2.5% v/v) for 20 min had little effect in any of the bacteria, even though all strains tested had been recorded as noxythiolin-sensitive by conventional plate sensitivity tests. Contact with noxythiolin for periods of at least 1-2 hrs was necessary before extensive bactericidal activity was detected. These results provide an explanation of the poor clinical performance of noxythiolin that we have observed.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  - Persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. The persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. Although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. With gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. With gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The duration of the postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration of exposure up to a point of maximal response. Persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin and carbenicillin as therapy for various infectious diseases.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of mezlocillin, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin, were compared with those of carbenicillin in a nonblind, controlled clinical study in 89 adult patients. The infections treated were primarily those of the urinary tract, skin, and gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the causative organisms isolated most frequently. A complete resolution of signs and symptoms was achieved in 78% of the mezlocillin patients and in 71% of the carbenicillin patients. In the mezlocillin group, causative organisms were eliminated in 80% of the courses, and in the carbenicillin group the elimination rate was 86%. Two adverse reactions, rash and diarrhea, were reported in mezlocillin-treated patients; none were reported for the carbenicillin group.
TI  - [Clinical study of a new cephalosporin ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904) in sepsis and other infectious forms of particular severity].
AB  
TI  - In vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: LY-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics Ly-127935 (LY), cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone (CFP) was examined. LY, CTX and CFP had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis while CFP was less inhibitory than LY or CTX against Klebsiella spp.; indole + Proteus and gentamicin (GM)-susceptible Serratia. LY and CTX were effective while CFP was inactive against Enterobacter spp. and GM-resistant Serratia. CFP was more active than LY or CTX against GM-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against GM-resistant isolates. Bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to LY than CTX or CFP. Combination studies against P. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-GM pairs demonstrated synergy.
TI  - Adhesion of Escherichia coli in urinary tract infection.
AB  - In individuals prone to urinary tract infections the intestine is colonized by E. Coli strains that possess a combination of properties determining virulence. Such an E. coli strain may colonize the vaginal and periurethral area and ascend the urinary tract. The ability to attach to the mucosal surface is thought to be essential for E. coli to colonize and to remain in the urinary tract. Most E. coli from patients with urinary tract infection show one or both of two adherence properties. One may depend on the recognition by type 1 fimbriae of mannose-containing residues in the urinary slime. It is measured as mannose-sensitive haemagglutination and is found on most E. coli strains. The second adherence property is detected as attachment to human urinary tract epithelial cells and as mannose-resistant agglutination of human erythrocytes. This may depend on the recognition of globo-series glycolipids in the epithelial cell surface. Possession of this adherence factor is strongly related to virulence. Most strains from patients with acute pyelonephritis and cystitis have this property but it is rare in strains from patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and strains from normal faeces. Local antibodies may interfere with bacterial attachment, thus possibly preventing the colonization that precedes urinary tract infection or modifying an established infection. Vaginal antibodies are known to coat E. coli from the stools. Antibodies in the urine of patients with acute pyelonephritis inhibit attachment of the infecting strain to uroepithelial cells. Antibodies directed against several bacterial surface structures, for example O antigen and fimbriae, are likely to inhibit attachment by steric hindrance or agglutination. The role of antibodies in adhesion-mediating structure such as fimbriae in susceptibility to and the outcome of human urinary tract infection remains to be investigated.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.

TI  - Topical antimicrobial cream sensitivity testing.
AB  - These gratifying results have made topical antimicrobial sensitivity testing an integral part of bacteriologic monitoring of the burn wound. Presently, we use the needle extrusion test routinely on all burn patients at our center. Its selection over the other antimicrobial tests is based on technical considerations. The needle extrusion test can be completed by an experienced technician within five minutes, but the disk diffusion test and agar-well diffusion test take two and five times longer, respectively. This time saving is an important consideration when the microflora of ten or more burn patient at our center are being monitored by this test every other day. This test system may prove useful for the topical antibiotic selection for the treatment of other wounds beside the burn wound. Its potential value in these other conditions must await the results of carefully controlled clinical studies.
TI  - The effect of local infection upon wound healing: an experimental study.
AB  - Local infection was introduced into rat abdominal wounds using a 10(8) bacterial/ml inoculum. Three groups of infection were used: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a combination group of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Infection was shown to delay healing as judged by bursting tests. Fibroblast proliferation was depressed at the wound edges but there was an increase in the total amount of hydroxyproline present. Small vessel angiogenesis was increased in areas of abscess formation but larger vessels were commonly blocked by thrombus or distorted by surrounding inflamed tissue. The possible causes of these effects are discussed.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A, a derivative of fortimicin A.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A (ODMF), a derivative of fortimicin A, was compared with those of fortimicin A and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. All three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter sp., and Staphylococcus aureus, with ODMF most active against Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. Activity of each of the antibiotics against group D streptococci was poor. The overall activity of ODMF was superior to that of fortimicin A for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both ODMF and fortimicin A were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-N-acetyltransferase-I. ODMF and fortimicin A showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin G. The combination of carbenicillin with ODMF, fortimicin A, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested. Inactivation of ODMF and fortimicin A when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. ODMF, fortimicin A, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, S. aureus, or P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin was the most active, followed by ODMF and fortimicin A. The superior in vitro activity of ODMF compared with fortimicin A against P. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

TI  - Naturally occurring plasmids exhibiting incompatibility with members of incompatibility groups I and P.
AB  - From a group of naturally occurring antibiotic resistance plasmids, a number of plasmids were identified which were incompatible with members of incompatibility group P and also incompatibility group I alpha or I gamma. These plasmids also exhibited strong entry exclusion with members of group P only and showed a host range which resembled that of plasmids of group I rather than those of group P. Segregants of a number of these plasmids appeared to have lost some of the incompatability and/or surface exclusion functions. Studies of nucleic acid homology indicated that these plasmids were very similar to one another. They exhibited 15 to 20% nucleic acid homology with representatives of the I alpha and I gamma groups, yet showed less than 2% homology with the group P plasmid RP4.
TI  - Single-disk diffusion testing (Kirby-Bauer) of susceptibility of Proteus mirabilis to chloramphenicol: significance of the intermediate category.
AB  - The significance of the intermediate category of the single-disk diffusion test (Kirby-Bauer) of antibiotic susceptibility has never been clearly defined. Thirty-two percent of 756 clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis were of intermediate susceptibility to chloramphenicol, a higher percentage than for any other species. The breakpoint separating susceptible and intermediate isolates nearly bisected the frequency distribution of zone diameters of P. mirabilis but not that of the other species. The breakpoint separating susceptible and intermediate isolates nearly bisected the frequency distribution of zone diameters of P. mirabillis but not that of the other species tested. By serial broth dilution testing, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chloramphenicol of 50 individual isolates of P. mirabilis were 3.9 to 22.1 micrograms/ml (geometric mean, 8.0), whereas the MICs of susceptible Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter strains were 2.0 to 3.9 micrograms/ml (geometric mean, 2.9). Seventy percent of isolates of P. mirabilis with MICs of 7.8 to 15.6 micrograms/ml were classified as susceptible by disk testing. We conclude that existing Kirby-Bauer breakpoints do not accurately discriminate P. mirabilis isolates that are marginally susceptible to chloramphenicol. These data underscore the difficulty of applying a single set of breakpoints to all species and suggest that species-specific breakpoints would more accurately predict the MIC equivalent of given zone diameters.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.

TI  - Antigenic relationships between pore proteins of Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Antisera were raised against the purified Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane proteins ompA-, ompC- and ompF proteins and protein e. Several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. Although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. The three general porins ompF protein, ompC protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. Anti-(ompA protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. None of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein III. Pore protein preparations isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloaceae and Proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the E. coli K12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against E. coli K12 porins.
TI  - Urinary beta 2-microglobulin excretion and renal lithiasis.
AB  - We assessed beta 2-microglobulin excretion in 42 active calcium oxalate stone-formers, 16 active struvite stone-formers, 4 active uric acid stone-formers, 14 inactive stone-formers and 21 non-stone-forming controls. The average excretion value was within normal limits for all groups and no significant differences existed. These observations coupled with previous findings of increased low molecular weight urinary proteins in active calcium oxalate stone-formers suggest the existence of specific alterations in tubular function in this specific group.

TI  - [Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of representatives of the enterobacteriaceae family in postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis].
AB  - The irradiation of CBA mice with gamma quanta in a dose of 700 C/kg resulted in the development of postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis in the animals. The dysbacteriosis was characterized by a considerable increase in the number of Escherichia and Proteus mirabilis in the large intestine and by the insemination of the small intestine with these microbial associations. Pr. vulgaris, Pr. morganii, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae, Citrobacter appeared in great numbers in the intestinal tract of the irradiated mice, while none of these organisms were found in the intact mice.
TI  - Experimental infection in rabbits evoked by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae treated with gentamicin, amikacin and sisomicin.
AB  - Rabbits were infected with freshly isolated strains of Ps. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, E. coli or K. pneumoniae and treated with gentamicin, amikacin or sisomicin in a controlled study. Therapeutic results were evaluated by survival of animals and viable counts of etiologic bacteria in several tissues after sacrification of treated animals at the same time. Sisomicin was the drug of choice for Ps. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis infections, when compared with amikacin and gentamicin. Its action is practically equal to that of amikacin in K. pneumoniae infection. Sisomicin appeared less active in E. coli infections than amikacin, but was superior to gentamicin.
TI  - Treatment of outpatient urinary tract infections with cinoxacin.
AB  - This paper describes an open assessment of cinoxacin in the treatment of 30 outpatients with symptomatic urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter. Twenty-seven patients (90 percent) had a satisfactory clinical response and in 26 patients, there was a satisfactory microbiological response with elimination of the pathogen. Mild side effects were reported by three patients, none of whom stopped therapy. It is concluded that cinoxacin will be useful in the treatment of urinary tract disease because of the high urinary antibacterial activity produced. The relatively low incidence of side effects and convenience of twice-daily dosage should encourage good compliance by patients treated outside the hospital setting.
TI  - Bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. Previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% H2O2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). Survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of H2O2 (0.6 to 0.01%) were constructed. Organisms with high cellular catalase activity (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% H2O2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. The efficacy of H2O2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation with bacterial suspensions. H2O2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of H2O2 into urinary drainage bags may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of major outer membrane proteins of Enterobacteriaceae, studied  by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Outer membrane fractions were prepared from 11 bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia coli serotypes O1K-, O4K2, O26K60, O75K-, and O111K58, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii. All strains studied were found to contain one non-peptidoglycan-bound, heat-modifiable outer membrane protein, and one or two peptidoglycan-associated major outer membrane proteins in the 27,000- to 40,000-dalton range. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacarylamide gel electrophoresis for separation of the antigens in the first dimension of the procedure was shown to provide a useful model system for studying the antigenic relationships of the major outer membrane proteins in Enterobacteriaceae species. Peptidoglycan-bound major outer membrane proteins of all bacteria studied reacted with antiserum against the purified peptidogylcan-bound matrix protein I of E. coli O26K60 in this system. Non-peptidoglycan-associated proteins of all strains cross-reacted with protein II of E. coli O26K60 in both their unmodified and their heat-modified forms. These results indicate that the genes coding for the major outer membrane proteins in the family Enterobacteriaceae have been well enough conserved during the course of evolution to allow significant antigenic cross-reactivity between the corresponding proteins in different enterobacterial species.
TI  - Comparative studies on the antimicrobial activity of peritoneal and ascitic fluids in human beings.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of peritoneal fluid obtained from 28 women undergoing  laparoscopy was compared with that of ascitic fluid obtained from 11 patients with various pathologic conditions. Similar antibacterial activity was found in these two types of fluid. The activity varied from bactericidal to bacteriostatic and was directed mainly against gram-negative bacilli-Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Bacteroides fragilis. Candida albicans was inhibited by many of the fluids, but the activity against gram-positive cocci was much less marked. Lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not solely responsible for the antimicrobial activity. The results of this study suggest the presence of at least three groups of thermostable antibacterial substances, two of which are bactericidal and one, bacteriostatic. One of the bactericidal factors is complement-dependent.
TI  - Expression of the lactose transposon Tn951 in Escherichia coli, Proteus and Pseudomonas.
AB  - The control of beta-galactosidase specified by the lactose transposon Tn951 (inserted into RP1 to give pGC9114) has been studied in Escherichia coli K12, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida; in the first two species comparison could be made with Flac. In E. coli K12, the Tn951 and chromosomally encoded enzymes showed marked qualitative differences in regulatio, the former giving a substantially lower maximum induced level and induction ratio. Several parameters were slightly affected by strain background. In P. mirabilis, beta-galactosidase control determined by both Flac (in accord with earlier work) and pGC9114 was markedly different from E. coli in that maximal induced levels were about an order of magnitude lower and the induction ratio was reduced to 3 to 5. In Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. putida, Tn951-specified lac expression was qualitatively similar to that in P. mirabilis. Possible reasons for anomalous expression in Proteus and Pseudomonas are discussed.
TI  - Combined antibacterial activity of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains.
AB  - Strains of bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics have been increasing in  number and are becoming troublesome in clinical medicine. The in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid was determined on selected ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates. Synergistic effects were produced by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Bacteroides fragilis. Inhibition of the beta-lactamases produced by the ampicillin-resistant strains was confirmed, especially against the penicillinases mediated by the R factor and the cephalosporinases produced by P.vulgaris and B. fragilis. The inhibitory effect of clavulanic acid against beta-lactamases was irreversible because of the high affinity of clavulanic acid to the enzymes.

TI  - Relation of antibody-coated urine bacteria to the site(s) of infection in experimental dogs.
AB  - Antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (Ig)G and anti-IgA, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. Urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with Staphylococcus aureus were tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with Escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with Proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with Klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with P rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, or Streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. Specimens of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. The results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. False-positive results (ie, evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%) tests of dogs infected with S aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with P mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with E coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with K pneumoniae. False-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with E coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with P mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with S aureus. It was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.

TI  - Effect of heavy metals on bacterial adherence.
AB  - A preliminary examination has been made of the effects of salts of heavy metals on bacterial adherence. 3H-thymidine labelled strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from sputa were incubated with human buccal cells and metallic salts. 10(-4)M zinc or iron salts significantly increased adherence of Enterobacteriaceae to human bucal cells in an in-vitro system. These effects were not altered by variation of the buffer system used, and seem dependent upon interactions between metals and bacteria that occur within about 5 minutes.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefamandole in the field of obstetrics and gynecology (author's transl)].
AB  - 1) Tissue concentrations of cefamandole (CMD) one hour after the end of 2 g/30 approximately 60 minutes drip infusion were 7.3 approximately 13.1 microgram/g in uterus, ovary and oviduct. These concentrations were higher than MICs of 70 approximately 100% of causative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter and Citrobacter, isolated from the infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. 2) CMD was administered to 14 patients with moderate infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology at a daily dose of 4 g for 5 approximately 7 days. The overall clinical efficacy obtained was as follows; excellent in 7 cases (50%), good in 3 cases (21%) and poor in 4 cases (29%). 3) Antimicrobial activity of CMD against causative organisms resembled that of CEZ. 4) No adverse effects and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. From the above, we considered that CMD was an effective and safe antibiotic against infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - An experimental model for ascending acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli or proteus in rats.
AB  - Experimental, ascending acute pyelonephritis in rats was produced by injecting 0  x 5 ml of 10(9) bacteria/ml into the urinary bladder via the urethra. No traumatic manipulation of the ureters of kidneys was necessary. A grading system for kidney lesions based on macro- and microscopical examination was used. The capacity of different Escherichia coli and proteus strains to induce acute pyelonephritis was tested, and the E. coli 06K13H1 strain and the Proteus mirabilis 03H1 strain were especially capable of causing urinary tract infection. For the P. mirabilis 03H1 strain, a dominance of right kidney lesions was noted in contrast to the E. coli 06K13H1 strain which did not show any side preference.
TI  - Boron-containing antibacterial agents: effects on growth and morphology of bacteria under various culture conditions.
AB  - The effects of a number of synthetic antibacterial agents of the borinic acid and diazaborine types on the growth of enteric bacteria were examined. In minimal medium aerobic growth was immediately slowed; slow nonexponential growth continued for an extended period, and the cells remained viable. The effect was also seen in anaerobic cultures and was not antagonized by a number of common nutrients, vitamins, or growth factors. The response was modified by the addition of casein hydrolysate to the medium. This seemed to be a nutritional effect dependent principally on lysine and leucine. The modified response consisted of a period of abnormal growth lasting for at least one doubling time after the addition of the antibacterial agent. The turbidity at first increased more rapidly than that of the controls and was approximately equal to that of the controls after 30 min. However, the increase in bacterial mass (dry weight) was only 0.75 of the amount predicted by the change in turbidity. The viable count increased in proportion to the turbidity. Changes in the cell envelope were revealed by electron microscopy and by an alteration in the response of cells to lytic agents. After the period of abnormal growth cultures entered a premature stationary phase.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - Attachment of Proteus mirabilis to human urinary sediment epithelial cells in vitro is different from that of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The in vitro attachment of 335 Proteus mirabilis strains from various human sources to human urinary tract epithelial cells was measured. No significant difference in adhesive capacity was found between P. mirabilis strains isolated from the blood of 89 patients with bacteremia, the stools of 36 healthy subjects and 56 patients with diarrhea, and the urine of 62 adults and 92 children with bacteriuria. High mean adhesion values were observed in all groups. The P. mirabilis strains attached only to squamous cells and not to transitional epithelial cells, whereas most of the Escherichia coli strains tested attached to both cell types; strains from patients with acute pyelonephritis attached more often than those from patients with acute cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria. The attachment of P. mirabilis to squamous epithelial cells was high about day 15 of the menstrual cycle of the epithelial cell donor, but low at the beginning and the end of the cycle. In contrast, the attachment of E. coli to squamous and transitional epithelial cells did not vary significantly with the menstrual cycle of the cell donor. Differences in adhesion characteristics of E. coli and P. mirabilis may relate to the differences in clinical appearance of urinary tract infections produced by the two organisms.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - Trimethoprim resistance in Finland after five years' use of plain trimethoprim.
AB  - A total of 1388 urinary bacterial pathogens were tested for resistance to plain trimethoprim after five years' use of this drug for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. Samples were obtained in Turku, Finland, where use of the drug is much greater than in other parts of Finland. Resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l; agar-dilution method) occurred in 20.3% of strains isolated from outpatients and 39.8% of strains isolated from inpatients. Escherichia coli and Micrococcus showed low incidences of resistance (11% and 13% respectively in ouptatients and 23% and 19% respectively in inpatients); Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis occupied an intermediate position; and Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella were resistant in 41-76% of cases. Similar incidences of resistance were observed to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. These findings together with the rare occurrence of side effects and convenient dosage confirm the usefulness of plain trimethoprim for urinary tract infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of netilmicin in comparison with gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin, and amikacin and their resistance patterns.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of netilmicin, gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin and amikacin was determined by means of the microdilution test. 1000 fresh isolates of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 7 species of the Enterobacteriaceae were tested. The activities were compared and cross-resistances were analyzed which appeared among the various drugs. Against amikacin, only 0.5% of all strains (3 P. aeruginosa, 1 S. aureus, 1 P. mirabilis) were resistant. Of the other drugs, netilmicin was the most active drug against S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli. Against E. coli, too, sisomicin showed its best activity, and further against Citrobacter spp., Proteus spp. and P. aeruginosa. A total of 12% of all pathogens was gentamicin-resistant. With one exception, these pathogens showed cross-resistance to at least one of the other drugs. In 39% of the cases a cross-resistance between gentamicin and tobramycin was noted, in 26% a gentamicin-tobramycin-sisomicin cross-resistance, in 17% gentamicin-tobramycin-sisomicin-netilmicin cross-resistance, in 11% a gentamicin-sisomicin-netilmicin cross-resistance. A complete cross-resistance was observed between gentamicin and sisomicin with S. aureus, Serratia spp. and Proteus mirabilis, between gentamicin and tobramycin with E. coli, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Naturally occurring plasmids in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: a P class R factor of restricted host range.
AB  - A naturally occurring transmissible plasmid, designated pAV1, has been isolated in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. It specifies resistance to sulphonamides and is capable of mobilizing two non-transmissible resistance determinants for tetracycline and neomycin, respectively, within strains of A. calcoaceticus. It is incompatible with the P class R factors RP4 and R751 in A. calcoaceticus. On this basis we conclude that pAV1 is a member of the P incompatibility group. However, unlike most other P group R factors, pAV1 is not transmissible to strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella or Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Vasectomy: etiology of infectious complications.
AB  - Semen was cultured prior to vasectomy for voluntary sterilization. Postvasectomy  infectious complications occurred only in patients with positive preoperative semen cultures. The offending pathogen was the same organism found in the semen culture. This evidence for an endogenous cause of postoperative vasectomy infections suggests that a semen culture and antimicrobial sensitivity be obtained prior to vasectomy. In this manner the correct antimicrobial agent can be instituted as an aid to rapid resolution of a postvasectomy infection.
TI  - Cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  - The increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by H. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. An antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. Cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. Organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae in 6, E. coli in 3, Proteus mirabilis in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. The Serratia were resistant (MIC greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other MIC's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. Satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. Two patients died from their underlying disease. Adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included SGOT rises in 3 and rash in one. Serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to 12.5 microgram/ml (trough). Sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. Cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  - Susceptibility of 4410 clinical isolates to doxycycline.
AB  - In an 1100-bed hospital where doxycycline has been widely used, the susceptibility to doxycycline of 4410 clinical isolates was examined. Ninety-one and 80.8 per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae strains, respectively, were susceptible to 1 mg doxycycline/l. Seventy-four per cent of the Escherichia coli and 81.7 per cent of the Klebsiella strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l. The Enterobacter and Enterococcus strains were less susceptible. Nearly all Proteus mirabilis isolates were resistant. The results are comparable to those of other studies.
TI  - In vitro-activity of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin combined against amoxicillin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The ability of clavulanic acid to inactivate beta-lactamase was investigated using 47 amoxicillin-resistant bacteria. In the presence of 10 mg/l clavulanic acid most strains of staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis became fully amoxicillin-sensitive. This effect of clavulanic acid was in most instances not observed with Serratia marcescens, Proteus inconstans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species.
TI  - [Bacteriological study on cefadroxil in vitro. Correlation between diameter of inhibition zone and inhibitory concentration (author's transl)].
AB  - There are only slight differences between the geometrical means of minimum inhibitory concentrations of (6R,7R)-7-[(R)-2-amino-2-2(p-hydroxyphenyl)-acetamido]-3-methyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-az abicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid (cefadroxil, Bidocef) and cefalexin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria freshly isolated from clinical material. Enterococci are more susceptible to cefadroxil. Considering the different break point, cefadroxil is on the whole more effective than cefalexin, in particular so against Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia coli. With the aid of the described regression analysis a meaningful interpretation of the results of the cefadroxil agar diffusion test is possible.
TI  - [Detection of ureolytic bacteria in the urine of stone patients (author's transl)].
AB  - Using a very sensitive and selective indicator medium we tested the urine of 308  stone patients for ureolytic bacteria. Urease-producing bacteria were found in 41 patients. In the urine of 13 of these patients we found more than 10(4) bacteria/ml and in 28 patients 10(4) or less. 75% of the patients with a positive urease test had infection stones. We believe that the test for urease is a convenient and necessary completion of the bacteriologic-diagnostic measures.
TI  - Comparative studies on the regulation of tryptophan synthesis.
AB  - In vitro DNA recombination techniques have revolutionized the study of genetic control of biosynthetic pathways. Using examples drawn from the pathway of tryptophan synthesis, approaches to the deciphering of regulatory signals and response mechanisms through transposition of DNA segments and DNA sequence analysis will be presented. After reviewing the known chromosomal arrangements and regulatory patterns of trp genes in the bacterial groups studied so far, and describing the results of transferring all or part of the pathway's genes from one organism to a distantly related one, the use of this technique to analyze new organisms will be described. Along with some advantages over the conventional methods there are some pitfalls. Finally, since it is likely that events analogous to recombinant DNA experiments take place readily in nature, their consequences in studies of bacterial evolution will be conjectured.

TI  - Fate of plasmids containing Mu DNA: chromosome association and mobilization.
AB  - The fluorescent dye, diamidinophenylindole-dihydrochloride (DAPI) can be added to CsCl gradients to enhance the density resolution of DNA species, independent of their topological configurations. When Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains carrying an RP4::Mucts plasmid were examined with the use of such a technique, it was found that after thermal induction of the prophage essentially al of the plasmid DNA became associated with the chromosome. This quantitative association is detergent-RNase- and pronase-resistant and dependent on the expression of Mu genes. The association is temporally, and probably functionally, correlated with the onset of Mu DNA replication. Genetic studies with F'::mini Mu plasmids indicate that some of the association results in stable Hfr formation, and does not require the product of Mu gene B.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin, piperacillin, Bay k 4999 with carbenicillin and ticarcillin against enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of five penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and Bay k 4999) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole positive Proteus sp. and Enterobacter species was determined by an agar dilution method. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were found to be the most active of the semi-synthetic penicillins tested against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Bay k 4999 was slightly more active than piperacillin against E. coli, about as active as piperacillin against Pseudomonas, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus, but more active than piperacillin against Enterobacter species.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as growth medium. The results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. The concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. Moxalactam was highly inhibitory against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. Moxalactam was highly superior against Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the MIC100 and MIC90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. High sensitivity was found in strains of Salmonella species, nine of which were Salmonella typhi: the MIC90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. The broad-spectrum activity and unusual MIC patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.

AB  - The cross-reactions of rat kidney with P. mirabilis and E. coli, and of rat urinary bladder with P. mirabilis were established by precipitation, agglutination and immunofluorescence methods. One of the cross-reactive bacterial components was the lipopolysaccharide. Human erythrocytes of Blood-groups A, O and AB were agglutinated by antisera to P. mirabilis and E. coli. The role of antigenic relatedness in urinary tract infections is discussed.
TI  - Primary structure of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specified by R plasmids.
AB  - Naturally occurring isolates of chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria commonly synthesise chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.28; CAT) in amounts which are sufficient to account for the resistance phenotype and often harbour plasmids which carry the structural gene for CAT. The findings of CAT in such diverse prokaryotes as Proteus mirabilis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Streptomyces sp., and a soil Flavobacterium has led to speculation concerning the origin and evolution of the more commonly observed CAT variants specified by plasmids in clinically important bacteria. To provide a more solid basis for studying the evolution and spread of CAT within prokaryotes we chose to determine the complete amino acid sequence of a type I variant of CAT, the variant known to be associated with most F-like plasmids conferring chloramphenicol resistance. The sequence has been determined by combining the results obtained from manual and automated sequential degradation with those obtained by mass spectrometry of peptides generated by enzymatic digestion. The directly determined primary structure is identical with that predicted by the DNA sequence analysis of the chloramphenicol resistance transponson Tn9 known to specify a type I variant of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935, a new 1-oxa cephalosporin, against aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 434 clinical aerobic gram-negative bacillary isolates were tested against LY127935, a new 1-oxa cephalosporin, and compared with other cephalosporins, penicillins, and aminoglycosides by a broth microdilution technique. Cefotaxime (HR756), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, and LY127935 were more active, and showed lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (ranges, less than or equal to 0.12 to 2.0 micrograms/ml), than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, Providencia spp., and Citrobacter spp. Against P. aeruginosa, pepercillin, azlocillin, and mezlocillin were the most active beta-lactam agents; 64 micrograms/ml inhibited 99, 93, and 87% of the isolates, respectively. LY127935 and cefotaxime at 16 micrograms/ml inhibited 71% of Pseudomonas isolates, whereas the aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 84, 88, and 93%, respectively. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined for all isolates and were generally the same as the minimum inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.

TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin, ceftizoxime (FK 749) with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - FK 749 is a distinctive new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum which is more potently active against a wide variety of Gram-negative bacilli, including the opportunistic pathogens such as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens, than SCE 963, T 1551 and cefmetazole. The activity of FK 749 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, pyogenes was by far superior to that of the three other antibiotics. These test organisms were not resistant to FK 749. The antibacterial activity of FK 749 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was almost the same as that of ticarcillin but was inferior to that of gentamicin and T 1551. The bactericidal activity of FK 749 against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was more potent than that of the three other antibiotics. FK 749, like cefmetazole, was extremely stable to beta-lactamases. In studies in mice, the therapeutic effect of subcutaneous injection of FK 749 against various infections due to Gram-negative bacilli was by far superior to that of SCE 963, T 1551 and cefmetazole, was almost the same as that of SCE 963 and cefmetazole against Staphylococcus aureus infection and that of ticarcillin against P. aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Specificity of attachment of certain enterobacteriaceae to mammalian cells.
AB  - The specificity of adherence of various Enterobacteriaceae to different mammalian cells was studied in vitro. 3H-Labelled organisms of the same species isolated from various clinical sources differed significantly in their abilities to adhere to the same mammalian cells. Bacteria frequently adhered better to cells derived from sites other than those analogous to their original source. Bacteria did not display consistently 'high' or 'low' attachment to a variety of human and tissue-cultured cells and little selective adherence was demonstrable.
TI  - Incompatibility of R plasmids from clinical material.
AB  - Thirteen R plasmids derived from strains of E Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical material have been characterized. They belonged to many incompatibility groups and differ widely respecting other phenotypic characteristics, even if they come from bacteria isolated from a small geographic area.
TI  - Prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection in female patients. Efficacy of  low-dose, thrice-weekly therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
AB  - Thirty-two women with recurrent urinary tract infections were treated after eradication of existing infections with a mixture of 40 mg of trimethoprim and 200 mg of sulfamethoxazole thrice weekly at bedtime for six months. Six preadolescents received one half this dose. During 21.3 cumulative patient-years of prophylaxis, one infection due to Streptococcus faecalis and one due to a sulfamthoxazole-and trimethoprim-sensitive Escherichia coli occurred--an infection incidence of 0.1 per patient-year. During prophylaxis, 61 of 72 periurethral cultures and 24 of 51 anal canal cultures failed to yield Enterobacteriaceae. One patient had transient colonization with a trimethoprim-resistant E coli during prophylaxis. Twenty-one patients had recurrent infection within six months of discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a mean time to recurrence of 2.6 months. One infection recurred 26 weeks following prophylaxis with a Proteus mirabilis. Thrice-weekly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy was effective for prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections and did not predispose to colonization or infection with trimethoprim-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Synthesis of a selective agar medium for Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A new agar medium for isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. The final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(CIN) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of Y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees C or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees C. The medium was highly selective, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Colony morphology coupled with a differential reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of Y. enterocolitica from most of those Gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. Recovery and selective characteristics of CIN agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. CIN agar gave a higher recovery of Y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than Salmonella-Shigella (0.0/0.7%) and MacConkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on three hydroxyiminophenylacetyl cephalosporins with particular reference to SK&F 80303, an unusually long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - Three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (SK&F 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and various Gram-negative bacilli. All three were active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against S. aureus, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. SK&F 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. It was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from S. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from E. coli strains. SK&F 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (partially). SK&F 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. Its combined biological properties make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.
TI  - [Epidemiology of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Among hospital-acquired infections, urinary tract infections are the widest spread. The most common pathogenic agents are E. coli, Enterococci and Proteus mirabilis. Indwelling bladder catheters account for about 70% of infections. Suprapubic urine drainage can reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections by approximatively 50%.
TI  - Effect of long-term tetracycline exposure (drinking water additive) on antibiotic-resistance of aerobic gram-negative intestinal flora of rats.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine the effect of 2 years of intermittent administration of tetracycline in drinking water on antibiotic resistance in the aerobic gram-negative enterobacteria of rats in a closed colony. The bacterial isolates examined were resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and streptomycin for intestinal organisms were similar in all of the animals, regardless of whether the animals were sampled while they were given drinking water with added tetracycline or at intervals of 3, 8, and 9 months after the antibiotic was no longer added to the drinking water. Biochemical examination of the isolates from each principal showed that Escherichia coli was the predominant enteric organism. In conjugation experiments, all E coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated transferred tetracycline and streptomycin resistance to an E coli K-12 recipient. Four different strains of rats that had not been treated with tetracycline (controls) were examined for tetracycline resistance. Tetracycline-resistant Proteus mirabilis was isolated from the intestines of these animals. Plasmid-mediated resistance could not be demonstrated. The E coli and P vulgaris isolates from these control animals were susceptible to tetracycline.
TI  - The nature of the genetic determinant for the SHV-1 beta-lactamase.
AB  - In two unrelated plasmids of incompatibility groups FII and N the gene for the SHV-1 beta-lactamase exists as part of a transposable element of molecular weight 9.5 megadaltons. This transposon has moved onto plasmids of at least three incompatibility groups; PI, Ialpha and J. This confirms the suggestion that the recent spread of the SHV-1 beta-lactamase has been associated with the transposition of the genetic determinant of this enzyme between unrelated plasmids.
TI  - Secretory IgA does not enhance the bacteriostatic effects of iron-binding or vitamin B12-binding proteins in human colostrum.
AB  - Human milk contains an unsaturated iron-binding protein (lactoferrin) and an unsaturated vitamin B12-binding protein. Lactoferrin has bacteriostatic properties, and a bacteriostatic role for the B12-binding protein has been postulated. In this study the bacteriostatic effect of lactoferrin was confirmed for strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas and Proteus. Growth inhibition attributable to the unsaturated B12-binding protein could be demonstrated only with a known vitamin B12-dependent E. coli. It has previously been shown that the bacteriostatic effect of lactoferrin is potentiated by horse IgG antibody, and a similar potentiating effect of secretory IgA antibody in colostrum and milk would have obvious importance. An attempt was therefore made to demonstrate potentiation of bacteriostatic effects by naturally occurring secretory IgA antibody to E. coli. The results obtained indicate that secretory IgA antibody does not enhance the growth-inhibiting effects of either lactoferrin or the vitamin B12-binding protein.
TI  - Requirements of immunoglobulin and the classical and alternative complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of multiple strains of Gram-negative aerobic bacilli.
AB  - The requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement  pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens by normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were determined. Human sera deficient in immunoglobulin or classical pathway activity, or both, were compared for their ability to promote phagocytosis os and killing of 13 bacterial strains by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Seven of the thirteen microorganisms required immunoglobulin for phagocytosis and killing and utilized only the classical complement pathway. Three required immunoglobulin and utilized both the classical and alternative pathways. The other three microorganisms required minimal immunoglobulin and utilized the alternative or classical pathway, or both. None of the microorganisms utilized the alternative pathway in immunoglobulin-deficient sera or could be forced to utilize this pathway in sera deficient in both immunoglobulin and classical pathway activity. These results demonstrated a heterogeneity in the requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes among various genera of gram-negative aerobic bacilli, as well as among strains of the same species. In addition, the results suggested that a mechanism of classical pathway activation dependent upon minimal immunoglobulin participates in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of certain gram-negative aerobic bacilli.
TI  - Lethal effect of complement and lysozyme on polymyxin-treated, serum-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - When genetically serum-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter freundii, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Proteus mirabilis, were exposed to polymyxin B, they became susceptible to the bactericidal action of normal human and rabbit sera. In constrast, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics did not render any serum-resistant bacteria serum-sensitive. Synergy between polymyxin B and the serum bactericidal system could be demonstrated by the addition of polymyxin B to bacteria in vitro, as well as to bacilli in serum from rabbits injected with the antibiotic. Polymyxin B-treated bacteria were killed by normal, lysozyme-depleted, C2-deficient, and hypogammaglobulinemic sera, but not by heated or C6-deficient sera. These findings indicate that polymyxin B-treated bacteria can be killed via the alternative complement pathway. However, C3 and C3b were detected on the surface of serum-resistant E. coli, regardless of whether the bacteria had been treated with polymyxin B. This observation suggests that a change in susceptibility to the alternative complement pathway was not the only explanation for the acquired serum sensitivity. Polymyxin B may also affect a step in the complement sequence beyond the activation of C3, a step that is apparently blocked in serum-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - Effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in experimental infections.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics were studied in two animal models. In mice, the oral cephalosporin CGP 9000 was effective in 11 of 20 different gram-negative infections and cephalexin was effective in one of these infections, both at 50% effective doses (ED(50)) that produced peak concentrations of drug in plasms equal to one-half to one-sixteenth the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the infecting organism. In gram-positive infections, both antibiotics were effective only at concentrations above the MIC. In rabbits, sub-MICs of cephaloridine, ampicillin, and gantamicin were maintained for 6-10 hr by intravenous infusion. At steady-state concentrations equal to one half to one-eighth the MIC, the beta-lactam antibiotics caused elongation and filamentation, and gentamicin caused enlargement, of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium in peritoneal exudate; the number of viable cells of each of these bacteria was temporarily reduced. In infections with E. coli and P. mirabilis, sub-MIC's of beta-lactam antibiotics and of gentamicin prolonged the survival rates for infected animals beyond those for control animals. Rabbits infected with S. typhimurium and treated with ampicillin at a concentration of one-third the MIC Tended to die sooner than did control animals.
TI  - Prostaglandin formation in bacteria.
AB  - We report here that intact Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid, produce and release PGE2 and PGF2 alpha into the medium as measured by radioimmunoassay. The seven bacterial strains so far studied release 6.5-50.9 ng PGE2 and less than 0.02-0.51 ng PGF2 alpha per mg bacterial protein during a 1 hour incubation, quantities of the same order of magnitude as those observed in mammalian systems. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha formation in bacteria are inhibited by indomethacin.
TI  - Australian evaluation of Autobac I with suggested interpretive and technical modifications.
AB  - Autobac I, a recently introduced semiautomated method for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing, has been evaluated by comparison with the calibrated dichotomous sensitivity disk diffusion technique, which is routinely used in many Australian hospitals. Only the most common clinical isolates, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were included in this evaluation, and an overall interpretive agreement of 93% was obtained. However, an unusually high rate of discrepancy was noted in several organism-antibiotic combinations, in particular E. coli and P. mirabilis with ampicillin, S. aureus with penicillin, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with methicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin. The discrepancies associated with ampicillin have been reduced from 29 and 24% for E. coli and P. mirabilis, respectively, to less than 5% after the utilization of commercial 10-micrograms diffusion disks, in preference to the lower antibiotic content disks supplied by the Autobac manufacturer. Furthermore, modifications in the interpretive procedure have eliminated discrepancies associated with S. aureus and penicillin.
TI  - Comparative study of cefaclor and amoxicillin in treatment of urinary tract infection.
AB  - Cefaclor or amoxicillin was given to 51 randomly assigned patients with urinary tract infections. Inclusion in the study required two pretreatment urine cultures yielding the same organism (susceptible to both antibiotics) in concentrations greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml. Both drugs were administered as 250 mg. orally every eight hours for ten days. Cefaclor was given to 27 patients and amoxicillin to 24. Most patients in both groups had negative urine cultures at five to nine days and four to six weeks following therapy. One patient in each group was unsuccessfully treated. Relapse or reinfection occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups. Both antibiotics were well tolerated. minimal inhibiting concentrations (MICS) of cefaclor, amoxicillin, cephradine, and cephalexin were determined by an agar dilution technique for the 44 available pretreatment isolates (41 Escherichia coli and 3 Proteus mirabilis). Mean MICs (micrograms./ml., +/- SD) were 2.2 +/- 1.4 for cefaclor, 4.4 +/- 2.0 with amoxicillin, 8.1 +/- 4.2 for cephradine, and 5.7 +/- 3.0 with cephalexin. Cefaclor is highly active in vitro against those gram-negative bacteria which are commonly isolated from urine. Cefaclor is as effective as amoxicillin when administered three times daily for the treatment of urinary tract infection.
TI  - Effect of serum and blood on Enterobacteriaceae grown in the presence of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and mecillinam.
AB  - Bacteria from the strains of five species of Enterobacteriaceae grown in the presence of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin or mecillinam formed into filamentous or round cells. These filamentous and round cells as well as normal control bacteria were incubated with either fresh human serum or blood, the bactericidal effects of which were then determined. In most cases, the bactericidal effect of either serum or blood on filamentous or round cells was less than the effect on control cells. In some cases, the effect on these drug-exposed cells was similar to that on control cells, but in no instance was the effect greater for the drug-exposed cells than for the control cells. However, in all cases in which the bactericidal effect of either serum or blood on the control cells was greater than or equal to 99%, the bactericidal effect on the drug-exposed cells was close to 90%. Although drug-exposed cells were not much more resistant to the bactericidal effect of serum or blood than were normal bacteria, they clearly were not more susceptible to these effects.

TI  - Ultraviolet irradiation disrupts somatic pili structure and function.
AB  - Three piliated bacterial species were exposed to ultraviolet light (7 X 10(3) microW/cm2), and the effect of increasing duration of irradiation on the integrity of the somatic pili was quantitated by negative-stain electron microscopy. Heavily piliated Proteus mirabilis became devoid of pili after 20 min of irradiation, but Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae required 40 min for complete depiliation. Partially purified proteus pili underwent progressive loss of structural integrity with increasing doses of irradiation as determined by negative staining and nephelometry, suggesting that ultraviolet light exerted an effect directly on the pili themselves. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that new, small molecular weight fragments appeared after irradiation of purified E. coli pili, suggesting that cleavage of the peptide chain rather than disassociation of pilin monomers accounted for the loss of pili structure. Ultraviolet irradiation also inhibited the ability of piliated bacteria to bind to human buccal epithelial cells. These observations indicate that the ultrastructural integrity and function of pili can be disrupted by ultraviolet light.
TI  - Immunochemical detection of N6-methyladenine in DNA.
AB  - Antibodies to N6-methyladenosine were produced in rabbit by means of immunization with N6-methyladenosine coupled to bovine serum albumin via periodate oxidation. Cross-reacting antibodies were removed by bovine serum albumin-Sepharose and appropriate nucleoside-human serum albumin absorbents. Nucleoside-specific antibodies were isolated by affinity chromatography of N6-methyladenosine-human serum albumin-Sepharose. The specificity of the purified antibodies has been demonstrated by complement fixation inhibition analyses using nucleoside analogues as inhibition than dAMP. Anti-N6-methyladenosine was used to detect N6-methyladenine in denatured DNAs from various sources by complement fixation. Practically no complement fixation has been found with DNAs containing no N6-methyladenine, such as calf thymus, salmon sperm, Micrococcus radiodurans, Streptomyces chrysomallus and Streptomyces hygroscopicus, whereas a weak reactivity occurred in the case of Bacillus subtilis DNA and Sarcina maxima DNA. For DNA from Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli K-12, E. coli B, E. coli WF+, lambda, T2 phages quantitative differences in the immunochemical reactivity were observed, which only partially correlate with the N6-methyladenine content of the DNAs. Other factors, influencing the accessibility of N6-methyladenine to the antibody-combining site have to be taken into consideration.
TI  - Silver-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from hospital patients.
AB  - The inclusion of agar medium containing 0.5 mM AgNO3 in the hospital laboratory replicating system for routine antibiotic-susceptibility determinations resulted in identification of species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii) with silver resistance. Since the study began in October, 1975, 11 in-hospital patients receiving silver sulfadiazine for burn wound prophylaxis have yielded silver-resistant bacteria from their infected burns. During this treatment routine burn-site cultures from these patients yielded 230 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including 211 which were sulfonamide-resistant, 97 of which were also silver-resistant, and 38 of which were untested for silver resistance. Seven silver-resistant but sulfonamide-sensitive isolates were incidentally recovered from respiratory specimens from four nonburn patients with silver tracheostomy tubes, one silver-resistant sulfonamide-sensitive isolate was recovered from a small infected burn on the foot of an Emergency Room patient. Previous treatment of this burn was unknown. Representative AgNO3-resistant E. coli isolates from four patients were serologically untypable. Serotyping of representative isolates of K. pneumoniae showed a diversity of types except from two patients who had been in the same ward at the same time.
TI  - Experimental gram-negative bacterial sepsis: prevention of mortality not preventable by antibiotics alone.
AB  - Outbred Swiss mice were inoculated intraperitoneally or intravenously with one 90 to 100% lethal dose of Escherichia coli O:18, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. After carefully timed intervals, aminoglycoside antibiotics were begun at dosages nnd intervals predetermined to constitute optimal therapy. With progressive increases in delay of antibiotic therapy, mortality rates increased progressively from 0% to 90 to 100%. Standardized models of infection were developed by selecting delay periods before initiating antibiotic therapy such that 50 to 70% mortalities resulted. Utilizing these models, agents with reputed anti-endotoxin activity were administered concomitantly with the delayed antibiotic therapy to determine if any could prevent gram-negative septic mortality no longer preventable by the antibiotics alone. The following were observed: (i) adrenal corticosteroids prevented mortality that was no longer preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. The following were preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy alone; (ii) specific antisera also did so, provided anaphylaxis was circumvented; (iii) in one model (P. mirabilis), such protection by adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum could be additive; (iv) adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum acted synergistically with the aminoglycoside antibiotics--no protection was achieved by delayed administration of the steroids or antiserum alone; (v) timing was crucial--the synergistic protective activity of adrenal corticosteroids and of specific antiserum with aminoglycosides declined rapidly as infection progressed; (vi) cyclophosphamide pretreatment markedly impaired the synergistic protective activity of specific antiserum and of adrenal corticosteroids with aminoglycosides; (vii) no reputed anti-endotoxin agents other than adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum proved capable of preventing mortality not preventable by aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. These included antisera to rough mutant Enterobacteriaceae of Rc, Rd, and Re chemotypes, anticoagulants (heparin), ascorbic acid, antiproteolytic agents (aprotinin), alpha adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid, sodium salicylate, indomethacin), nicotinamide, glucose, and insulin-glucose-potassium mixtures.
TI  - [Effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin (author's transl)].
AB  - With the investigations of the effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin, following experimental results were obtained; 1. Effect of combination of amikacin, cephapirin and hetacillin was differed depending upon the genus and species of bacteria. However, in general, in the cases showing effective results there was a relation in the concentration of these antibiotics. With strains of Escherichia coli amikacin and cephapirin was cooperative, but not with other combinations and strains of Proteus showed similar tendencies to those strains. In the strains of Pseudomonas, no effect was observed with these antibiotics. However, significant cooperative effect was shown in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococci cooperative effect was represented only a combination of amikacin and hetacillin. 2. Amikacin was resistant against penicillinase isolated from penicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus and cephalosporinase extracted from cephalosporin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli. 3. When a strain of K. pneumoniae, showing cooperative effect with amikacin and cephapirin, was examined by electronmicroscopy, enlargement of cells and destruction of the cell walls were observed.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (BL-S 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. Cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. One Gram-positive strain and six Gram-negative strains were used. Bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. Tests showed that against Klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. Proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; Enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; Escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. The number of viable cells of Staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. On the other hand, Providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.

TI  - [Antibacterial in-vitro activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid (author's transl)].
AB  - The in-vitro activity of nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid was investigated in a  combined study in 450 freshly isolated bacterial strains using the agar dilution test. Gram-positive cocci were resistant to both substances except for a few pipemidic acid sensitive staphylococci. Both substances had good antibacterial activity in the gram-negative spectrum. However, the MIC values of pipemidic acid were generally clearly lower than those of nalidixic acid. Only pipemidic acid showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus the in-vitro results showed that pipemidic acid has clear-cut and valuable advantages for the treatment of urinary tract infections when compared with nalidixic acid.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - Epidemic occurrence of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - In case-control studies of three epidemics of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis  (NEC) in three different high-risk nurseries in three states, no particular risk factor was associated with affected infants or their mothers. Epidemic cases had higher birth weights and Apgar scores and fewer perinatal difficulties than those previously reported for sporadic cases. Seven infants fed primarily breast milk were not protected against disease. Early antibiotic therapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of disease in one outbreak. In two hospitals, affected infants who received antibiotic therapy during the first three days of life had a significantly later disease onset. The occurrence of the disease in epidemics and the decreased risk or modification of disease with antibiotic therapy support an infectious etiology for NEC.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from urine cultures].
AB  - The AA report the data pertinent to the urine culture performed during a year in  the Sanitary and Prophylactic Laboratory of the district of L'Aquila. In urine samples with number of bacteria > 10(5)/ml have been found E. coli (49%), Proteus mirabilis (32%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Proteus rettgeri (1%), Enterococco (1%). The data are also reported concerning germ resistance to several antibiotics.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Covalent linkage of lipoprotein to peptidoglycan is not essential for outer membrane stability in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Isolated rigis layers from Proteus mirabilis harvested at different growth phases were degraded by endo-N-acetylmuramidase from Chalaropsis B, and the degradation products were investigated. The results show the complete absence of covalently linked lipoprotein in exponential-phase cultures. Stationary cells, however, possess covalently linked lipoprotein in amounts similar to those found in Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium during all growth phases. The overall peptidoglycan structure did not change during transition from logarithmic to stationary growth. Implications of these findings for the organization of the outer membrane are discussed.
TI  - [Morphological studies on antibacterial activities of cefotiam (author's transl)].
AB  - 1. Cefotiam was demonstrated to be more potent than cefazolin in its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii and Proteus inconstans. MICs of cefotiam with 10(6) cells/ml inoculum size were considerably lower than those with 10(8) cells/ml. 2. Organisms lysed when exposed to cefotiam at concentrations higher than the MICs with 10(8) cells/ml. Morphological changes of organisms into filament occurred even at concentrations lower than the MICs with 10(6) cells/ml. This indicates that cefotiam is incorporated into organisms at remarkably low concentrations and exerts its antibacterial activities. 3. Cefotiam showed a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 1A, 1Bs and 3. The formation of filament at low concentrations of cefotiam is possibly attributable to the high affinity of cefotiam for PBP 3 in addition to its high permeability through outer cell membrane. 4. As the antibacterial activities of cefotiam are displayed at lower concentrations, it is reasonable to consider that doses of cefotiam on clinical use can be reduced in comparison with those of conventional cephalosporins.

TI  - [Mechanisms of Proteus resistance to chloramphenicol].
AB  - Data on chloramphenicol sensitivity of clinical Proteus strains isolated within 1970--1975 and some mechanisms of their resistance to this antibiotic are presented. It was found that most of the Proteus strains (62.82 +/- 2.15 per cent) were resistant to chloramphenicol. 75 per cent of the isolates had resistance of transmissive character. Resistance of the Proteus cultures to chloramphenicol was not a stable feature and was lost during storage under laboratory conditions. Direct correlation between stability of the antibiotic resistance in the Proteus, the resistance level and the period of the culture storage was found. It was shown that the transmissive resistance to chloramphenicol in the Proteus cultures was due to synthesis of a highly active constituitive chloramphenicol-inactivating enzyme. Direct relation between the Proteus resistance level to chloramphenicol and the rate of the enzyme synthesis was noted. A number of the Proteus strains phenotypically sensitive to this antibiotic was capable of its inactivation. Still, the activity of the enzyme was low. The rate of the enzyme synthesis and the level of the acquired resistance in the chloramphenicol resistant mutants depended on the presence or absence of the enzyme in the cells of the initial sensitive strain. The capacity for chloramphenicol accumulation in a number of the chloramphenicol resistant mutants of the Proteus was decreased.
TI  - Trimethoprim in combination with a sulfonamide for oral treatment of canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - Trimethoprim, in combination with sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole was administered orally for 7 to 14 days to 84 dogs with urinary tract infections (UTI). The daily dosage of 26.4 mg/kg (12 mg/lb) was divided into 2 equal parts and administered at about 12-hour intervals. Response to treatment, based on negative urine culture during or after therapy, was 37 of 45 (82%) for UTI caused by Escherichia coli, 11 of 15 (73%) UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, 8 of 12 (67%) UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 of 6 (100%) UTI caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 of 9 (56%) UTI caused by Streptococcus spp. These 5 species comprised 88% of the bacteria isolated from the dogs in this study.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Urinary beta 2 microglobulin in upper and lower urinary-tract infections.
AB  - Beta 2-- microglobulin excretion in 24 h urine collections and beta2- microglobulin clearance were significantly increased in patients with upper-urinary-tract infections, but beta 2- microglobulin clearance and excretion were normal in patients with cystitis. Beta 2-microglobulin estimation may be used to distinguish between upper and lower urinary-tract infections, except when pre-existing tubular damage is present. Voided urine must have a pH above 6 . 0, since beta 2- microglobulin is rapidly degraded in the bladder at low pH.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant Serratia marcescens infection in a hospital.
AB  - Over a 12-month period, 74 isolates of Serratia marcescens were obtained from various sources at Tygerberg Hospital. The majority of these isolates were from catheterized patients with urinary tract infections, and were non-pigmented and resistant to all antibiotics tested, excepting amikacin and neomycin. All isolates transferred resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin and tetracycline by conjugation to Escherichia coli recipients as separate markers at low frequency. A non-self-transmissible plasmid conferring resistance to kanamycin, ampicillin and gentamicin was mobilized from Serratia species to E. coli, and became fully self-transmissible in subsequent matings.
TI  - [Expression of the gene for tetracycline resistance of plasmids R6 and RP4 in bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - It was found that manifestation of the tetracycline resistance gene depended on the type of the plasmid containing the gene. The tetracycline resistance gene was subject to less repression in plasmid R6 than in plasmid RP4. Sensitivity of the initial plasmid-free bacteria varied within lower dose ranges than that of the plasmid-carrying strains. Regulation of the tetracycline resistance gene manifestation in the given plasmid may change in different bacterial hosts, i.e. in different cytoplasmic environment at different gene background.
TI  - Gene copy number effects in the mer operon of plasmid NR1.
AB  - The level of resistance to Hg2+ determined by the inducible mer operon of plasmid NR1 was essentially the same for three gene copy number variants in Escherichia coli, less in Proteus mirabilis, and intermediate in P. mirabilis "transitioned" to a high r-determinant gene copy number. Cell-free volatilization rates of radioactive mercury indicated increasing levels of intracellular mercuric reductase enzyme from low- to high-gene copy number forms in P. mirabilis and from low- to high-copy number forms in E. coli, but the additional enzyme in E. coli was effectively cryptic.
TI  - Alteration of perirenal fat secondary to diffuse retroperitoneal infiltration.
AB  - Inflammatory effusions and diffuse neoplasia in the fatty retroperitoneal space,  which can alter the perirenal fat, can be recognized radiographically because of density differences. The opacity of fluid and tumor accentuates the remaining fat which conforms to the renal contour. This perirenal fatty border appears as a lucent strip when the perirenal fat is not violated and as abnormal perirenal streakiness when the perirenal fat is infiltrated by fluid or tumor. Six cases are described.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial activity of sulphonamide-trimethoprim combinations.
AB  - Sensitivity patterns of 326 clinical isolates toward sulphonamide/trimethoprim combinations were tested in vitro. The relative merits of the different combinations are discussed in their pharmacological and bacteriological contexts. It is concluded that organisms sensitive to cotrimoxazole as judged by in vitro sensitivity tests performed at 37 degrees C are also sensitive to sulphamoxole/trimethoprim.
TI  - Prevention of colonization of the urinary tract of mice with Escherichia coli by  blocking of bacterial adherence with methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside.
AB  - Methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (alpha MM), a competitor inhibitor of the binding  of mannose by Escherichia coli, was tested for its ability to prevent infection of the urinary tract of mice with infective strains of the organisms. Injection of the bacteria in the presence of the drug resulted in a considerable reduction in the number of bacteriuric mice. In this system alpha MM was inactive against Proteus mirabilis in accordance with its inability to inhibit the adherence of this organism to epithelial cells in vitro, and methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside proved inactive against both E. coli and P. mirabilis.

AB  - The in vitro activity of cefazaflur, a parenteral cephalosporin, was determined against 590 clinical isolates. Cefazaflur inhibited the majority of gram-positive cocci at concentrations below 1 mug/ml except for enterococci. The agent was as active as cefamandole or cefoxitin against most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Although it inhibited a number of strains of Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, and Serratia resistant to cephalothin, it was much less active against these organisms than were cefamandole or cefoxitin.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin compared with that of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Piperacillin (T-1220), a semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was more active than either carbenicillin or ticarcillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; over 60% of isolates were inhibited at a concentration of 6.3 mug/ml. Piperacillin was bactericidal for 84% of Pseudomonas strains at 100 mug/ml, carbenicillin killed 60%, and ticarcillin killed 68% at that concentration. Piperacillin was also more active than the other penicillins against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, and Proteus mirabilis. The combination of piperacillin and tobramycin, demonstrating synergistic inhibition of 87% of strains of P. aeruginosa, was the most active of the penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations tested for synergism.
TI  - BL-S786 (ceforanide), a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - BL-S786 (ceforanide) is a new cephalosporin which showed broad-spectrum activity  in vitro against 453 clinical isolates. At a concentration of 3.12 mug/ml, it inhibited greater than 75% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essentially no activity was observed against isolates of Serratia marcescens, and only minimal activity was observed against Enterobacter spp. Its activity was directly related to the size of the inoculum. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar to the minimal inhibitory concentrations for isolates of all organisms except S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for these organisms.
TI  - HR 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(Z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. HR 756 inhibited Neisseria and Haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae. HR 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. It was twice as active as carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited Bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. HR 756 killed E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Cefatrizine activity compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefatrizine, a new orally administered cephalosporin, was tested against 400 clinical isolates. Cefatrizine had excellent activity against gram-positive cocci, inhibiting all except enterococci at minimal inhibitory concentrations below 1 mug/ml. Cefatrizine inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella at concentrations below 12.5 mug/ml. Although cefatrizine was not hydrolyzed by many beta-lactamases, it did not inhibit a number of strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, or indole-positive Proteus. Cefatrizine was more active than cephalothin or cephalexin against E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella. Its overall activity was less than that of cefoxitin against strains resistant to cephalothin, but its activity against cephalothin-susceptible strains was equivalent to that of cefamandole.

TI  - Properties of R plasmid R772 and the corresponding pilus-specific phage PR772.
AB  - R plasmid R772 was isolated from a strain of Proteus mirabilis and is a self-transmissible P-1 incompatibility group plasmid having a molecular weight of about 27 x 10(6). It renders bacterial hosts resistant to kanamycin. Phage PR772 was isolated as a phage dependent on the presence of R772 in bacterial hosts. It is hexagonal-shaped with a diameter of 53 nm, has a thick inner membrane and no tail. Vaguely defined appendages are sometimes apparent at some vertices and the phage possesses double-stranded DNA. The DNA has a guanine plus cytosine molar content of 48%. The phage is sensitive to chloroform and has a buoyant density of 1.26 g cm(-3). These observations suggested that the inner membrane of the phage could contain lipid. Phage PR772 differs in morphology from the double-stranded DNA plasmid-specific phages PR4 and PRR1 which adsorb to tips and sides, respectively, of sex pili coded for by P-1 incompatibility group plasmids. Phage PR772 formed clear plaques which varied in diameter. Serologically, phages PR772 and PR4 are possibly related though very distantly, but the two phages have identical host ranges. Phage PR772 adsorbed by one of its apices to tips of sex pili coded for by plasmid R772 in Escherichia coli. It also formed plaques on Salmonella typhimurium Proteus morganii and Providence strains harbouring this plasmid as well as strains of E. coli carrying plasmids of incompatibility groups N or W. The phage produced areas of partial clearing on lawns of P. mirabilis PM5006 harbouring plasmid R772, the P-1 incompatibility group plasmid RP4, the W group plasmid RSa or the N group plasmid N3, and on lawns of Providence strain P29 carrying plasmid RP4.
TI  - Dysuria in general practice.
AB  - An analysis of 98 clinical consultations for dysuria in an urban general practice revealed that only 60 percent of patients had proven urinary tract infections. Two percent had gonorrhoea and the rest had an urethral syndrome. Most of the urinary tract infections were caused by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus epidermidis. Proteus mirabilis was the next commonest infecting organism. Among the commonly used urinary antimicrobials, nitrofurantoin was found to be the cheapest and most effective agent. The aetiology of the urethral syndrome was obscure and apart from a small minority of patients who had thrush (16 percent) no obvious cause could be found.

Two hundred twelve strains were isolated and identified as: Escherichia coli--25 strains, Hafnia--16 strains, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Proteus mirabilis--9 strains of each. The remaining Gram-negative genera and species were more rarely encountered. Gram positive bacteria: Micrococcus--19 strains, Staphylococcus aureus--17 strains, Staph. epidermidis--15 strains, Bacillus cereus--15 strains, B. subtilis--12 strains. Other representatives of Gram-positive bacteria were also found but in lower percentages. Least bacteria were observed in semen fluid frozen in plastic straws and most--in plastic ampules which were mainly used until recently for cow insemination. It was established that the same bacteria isolated by other authors from fresh sperm were encountered in semen fluid stored at minus temperatures. The conclusion is made that semen fluid stored at low temperature is contaminated with bacteria. It is only natural that these bacteria are introduced in cow genitals by insemination.
TI  - Treatment with azlocillin in complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - 20 patients, aged 18-84 years, with complicated urinary tract infections admitted to hospital were treated with 6-[(R)-2-(2-oxo-imidazolidine-1-carboxamido)-2-phenyl-acetamido]-penicillanic acid sodium salt (azlocillin, Securopen) for 5 to 10 days. Isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Escherichia coli (2) and Klebsiella spp. (1). Serum concentrations and urine recovery were measured on the fifth day of treatment. The mean serum half-life was 1.85 h and the mean value of the urine recovery 47% of the single dose. Tissue concentrations were analyzed in one patient. The samples were taken 3 h after the infusion. The azlocillin concentration of the renal cortex, 60 microgram/g, was six times higher than the corresponding serum concentration. On the 5th day of treatment the urine was sterile in 80% of the patients. In 12 patients (60%) the urine was still sterile when controlled 2-6 months later. Three patients were treated twice and bacteriologically cured after each period. No sign of sensitization was seen. Side-effects were not reported.
TI  - [The antibacterial efficacy of cefaclor against bacteria resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole (author's transl)].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the new oral cephalosporin cefaclor was investigated using 623 freshly isolated bacterial strains. A high degree of efficacy of cefaclor was noticed against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella. Nearly all strains which were sensitive to ampicillin, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole were also inhibited by cefaclor. Some of the strains resistant to the three above-mentioned antibiotics were also sensitive to cefaclor as follows: all of ten P. mirabilis strains resistant to co-trimoxazole, 54% of the E. coli strains resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole, and 18% of the Klebsiella strains resistant to tetracycline and co-trimoxazole.
TI  - [Resistance of gram-negative bacteria against cefaclor and other antibiotics (author's transl)].
AB  - Five hundred and eighty-six strains of eight species of Enterobacteriaceae were tested for their resistance against cefaclor, cefamandole, cephalothin, ampicillin, mezocillin, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. Cefaclor showed a low rate of resistance against Escherichia coli (1.2%), Klebsiella (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.1%), but a high rate of resistance against indole-positive Proteus species (60%) and Serratia (80%). Cefamandole was also effective against cefaclor and ampicillin resistant strains. Multiresistant strains were predominant especially amongst Enterobacter, Serratia and indole-positive Proteus species. Of 266 ampicillin resistant strains, 198 strains (74.4%) proved to be sensitive to cefaclor. Among the orally administered antibiotics cefaclor exhibited the best result with 12.1% resistant strains compared to 14.8% strains resistant to co-trimoxazole and 45.4% resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - In vitro investigations with fosfomycin on Mueller-Hinton agar with and without glucose-6-phosphate.
AB  - Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in the agar dilution test on Mueller-Hinton agar showed that the addition of glucose-6-phosphate to the nutrient medium potentiates the action of fosfomycin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Staphylococcus aureus, sometimes by as much as 256-fold. Such a potentiation of action was not detectable with Serratia marcescens, the individual Proteus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci. Fosfomycin is very effective against most medically important bacterial species on Mueller-Hinton agar containing 25 micrograms/ml glucose-6-phosphate. Over 90% of the cultures of E. coli, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, S. marcescens,Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and enterococci examined were inhibited by less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml fosfomycin.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefotaxim in comparison with seven cephalosporins].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefotaxim and seven cephalosporins was determined in 1,112 fresh isolates using the microdilution technique. All of the cephalosporins tested were ineffective against enterococci. Cefalotin was the most effective agent against Staphylococcus aureus. Cefaclor was superior to cephalexin against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, and thus inhibited 20% more Enterobacteriaceae. Cefazolin was as effective as cefamandole against E. coli. Cefuroxime and cefoxitin were almost equally effective against E. coli, Klebsiella and P. mirabilis; more than 95% of the strains were sensitive. Cefuroxime and also cefamandole were much more effective than cefoxitin against Citrobacter and Enterobacter. Cefoxitin on the other hand was superior against Serratia and indol-positive Proteus species. Cefotaxim was by far the most active cephalosporin against Enterobacteriaceae, only 2% of the strains being resistant. More than 90% of the strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis and Serratia were sensitive to 1 mg/l, the lowest degree of activity being displayed against Enterobacter; 82% of the strains were inhibited by 16 mg/l. Cefotaxim was the only cephalosporin which showed appreciable activity against Pseudomonas.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefazedone.
AB  - Distinct bactericidal activity of (6R,7R)-7-(2-[3,5-dichloro-4-oxo-1(4H)-pyridyl]-acetamido)-3-([(5-methyl-1,3,4-th iadiazol-2-yl)-thio]methyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-1-aza-bicyclo[4,2,0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxyl ic acid (cefazedone, Refosporen) could be demonstrated in 2 Staphylococcus aureus and 3 Escherichia coli strains. The effect was less in 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Whereas the activity in serum and bile was higher than in nutrient broth, the bactericidal activity in urine was less pronounced. The combination of cefazedone and gentamicin proved to be bactericidal in low concentrations.
TI  - [F' transfer from Escherichia coli to Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - The task of this work was the establishment of an effective transfer system for F'-plasmids from Escherichia coli to Proteus mirabilis. It is shown that cells of PG VI act as recipients in crosses with E. coli F' strains but with a low transfer rate of the plasmid. The presumption that a restriction -- modification system in P. mirabilis was the only reason for the low transfer could not be confirmed. An indirect selection method was developed to isolate P. mirabilis cells which are better recipients. Conjugation experiments showed that the isolated mutants had a better recipient capacity (increase of about 100). This is true not only for the transfer of a F'-plasmid but also for a R-plasmid. The stability of these plasmids in the mutant cells, however, was much lower than in the wild type.
TI  - [Basic and clinical examinations of CS-1170 in pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - 1. CS-1170 was administered for the purpose of prophylaxis during cardiac catheterization in patients with heart disease, and its blood levels were measured. 2. The mean blood level (Moni-Trol I standard) after one intravenous shot of 20 mg/kg was 53.6 mcg/ml in catheterized children aged below 6 and 66.9 mcg/ml in catheterized children aged above 10 at 30 minutes, and 1.95 mcg/ml and 5.2 mcg/ml respectively at 6 hours. 3. The mean half life of the blood level was 1.09 hours in catheterized children aged below 6, 1.37 hours in catheterized children aged above 10, and 0.71 hours in infections children. 4. The urinary excretion seemed satisfactorily high although there was a great variation. 5. The clinical efficacy was 88.9%. 6. The bacteriological efficacy was 100% for E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus and was 0% for Staphylococcus epidermidis. 7. Although GOT and GPT were elevated in one case as a side effect, they rapidly returned to normal after discontinuation of administration.
TI  - The recovery period following exposure of bacteria to penicillins.
AB  - Experiments with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes have shown that when cells are exposed to bactericidal concentration of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated with beta-lactamase the count of the surviving viable cells (colony-forming units) remains essentially constant for a period of approximately 1.5--3 h before increasing at a normal rate. No such recovery period was observed, however, when Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis was exposed to a bactericidal concentration of ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated. Microscopic observation of individual surviving cells of S. aureus following exposure to benzylpenicillin showed that in some cases resumption of cell division was delayed as long as 4 h. However, other cells in the same population showed no recovery period and resumed division within 30 min of inactivation of the antibiotic. In the latter case, the recovery period which is observed in terms of viable count may represent the period of time required for individual surviving cells to divide and give rise to normal aggregates before these fragment to produce new colony-forming units.
TI  - Conduit urinary diversion and urinary-tract infection. II. Raised serum antibody  titers against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in relation to bacteriologic findings.
AB  - Elevated serum antibody titers against Escherichia coli and/or Proteus mirabilis  were found in 35% of 89 patients with a conduit urinary diversion. Statistical analysis showed significant correlation between the titers and growth of E. coli or P. mirabilis in conduit urine. But 17 (24%) of 72 patients without E. coli in urine cultures had raised E. coli antibody titer. Only 3 (4%) of 68 patients without growth of P. mirabilis had raised P. mirabilis antibody titer. When the post-diversion observation period was more than five years, the frequency of antibody titer elevation was greater than in patients with shorter post-diversion follow-up. The volume of residual urine in the conduit showed statistically significant correlation with presence of bacteriuria and with the antibody titer level against P. mirabilis. Patients with high antibody titers tended to have high readings of serum creatinine. Antibiotic therapy reduced elevated E. coli and P. mirabilis antibody titers. Titration of antibodies to E. coli and P. mirabilis is recommended in the follow-up care of patients with conduit urinary diversion.
TI  - Conduiturinary diversion and urinary-tract infection. I. Serum antibody titers against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in relation to urographic findings.
AB  - The serum antibody titers against Escherichia coli and/or Proteus mirabilis were  elevated in 26 of 80 patients (33%) with a conduit urinary diversion. Urographic findings were abnormal in 44 of these 80 patients (55%). Urography was normal in 59% of the patients with normal antibody titers, but in only 15% of those with elevated titers. Raised antibody levels against E. coli O antigen (greater than 256 before and/or greater than 32 after mercaptoethanol treatment of serum) were associated with wide upper urinary tract or calculi more often than were normal E. coli antibody titers. Raised titers against P. mirabilis (greater than 256 before and/or greater than 32 after mercaptoethanol treatment of serum) were associated with scarring of the renal parenchyma more frequently than were normal titers. A statistically significant association was found between "small" kidney area and raised serum antibody titers against E. coli or P. mirabilis. The frequency of "small" kidney increased with the time lapse after urinary diversion. At 3 to 11 months postoperatively it was 29%, but among the patients with urinary diversion for more than five years the corresponding frequency was 82%. When at least one kidney was "small", the serum creatinine was higher than when both kidneys were of normal size. Patients with raised antibody titers tended also to have high serum creatinine (greater than or equal to 124 mumol/l) more often than those with normal titers (23 vs. 10%). These observations imply a connection between elevation of the antibody titers and destruction of the renal parenchyma in patients with conduit urinary diversion. They illustrate the value of antibody titration in the follow-up of patients with urinary diversion.
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins in Proteus species.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins in three species of Proteus, Proteus mirabilis, P. morganii, and P. rettgeri, were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. Penicillin-binding proteins in these Proteus species were compared with those in Escherichia coli K-12. An approximate correlation between penicillin-binding proteins in E. coli and those in Proteus species was shown by several criteria: electrophoretic mobilities; affinities of several beta-lactam antibiotics which show characteristic patterns of binding to penicillin-binding proteins in E. coli; relation between affinities of antibiotics to the proteins and effects on morphological changes in Proteus species; location of beta-lactamase activity among penicillin-binding proteins; and thermostability. The electrophoretic mobilities and several other characteristics of penicillin-binding proteins among the Proteus species examined were found to be similar from species to species and differed only slightly from those of E. coli.
TI  - Comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.
TI  - Investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with Crohn's disease.
AB  - The immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with Crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. Two aerobic bacterial species, E. dispar and P. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, B. fragilis ss. fragilis, F. varium and two different strains of C. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. These strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the patient. Immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. In connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates. Antibodies belonging to IgG and IgA took part in the active immune response while IgM was very little involved. Antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. Antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. The importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with Crohn's disease is discussed.
TI  - [The antibacterial efficacy of cefaclor in routine testing of clinical material from two Berlin hospitals (author's transl)].
AB  - The agar diffusion method was used to test the antibacterial efficacy of cefaclor against bacterial strains isolated routinely from patients in two hospitals in Berlin. A comparison was made with the efficacy of oxacillin, azlocillin, amikacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, penicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin. A total of 1235 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus species, Citrobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Cefaclor was superior to the other substances in its activity against E. coli, Klebsiellae, and Proteus mirabilis. Co-trimoxazole and tetracycline, on the other hand, proved more effective against indole-positive Proteus species and Citrobacter. Tetracycline was also more effective against Enterobacter. Ampicillin was the most effective agent against enterococci, and oxacillin the most effective against S. aureus. Cefaclor showed good antibacterial activity against strains which were resistant to the orally administrable agents ampicillin, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of mezlocillin and azlocillin/A survey (author's transl)].
AB  - A review of the antibacterial activity of 6-[(R)-2-[3-methylsulfonyl-2-oxo-imidazolidine-carboxamido]-2-phenyl-acetamido]-p enicillanic acid sodium salt (mezlocillin, Baypen) and 6-[(R)-2-(2-oxo-imidazolidine-1-carboxamido)-2-phenyl-acetamido]-penicillanic acid sodium salt (azlocillin, Securopen) is given on the basis of extensive in vitro studies. The action of each of the preparations is compared with that of important antibiotics of other substance classes from the group of penicillins and cephalosporins.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of tobramycin and gentamicin against 6,042  clinical isolates.
AB  - 6,042 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were tested against tobramycin and gentamicin. Among all species studies, except Pseudomonas sp, gentamicin turned out to be slightly superior to tobramycin.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in various medical services.
AB  - The analysis of differences in occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains belonging to ten species of "problem" bacteria was performed by means of a computer program in more than 150,000 bacterial strains isolated in Slovakia in 1977. In all respects, strains isolated in general medical practice were considerably more sensitive to classical as well as to newer antibiotics. Marked differences in resistance within individual medical services could be a reflection of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the use of a given antibiotic. Urological and surgical wards, and in some respects pediatric and infectious diseases services, rendered the highest percentage of strains resistant to various drugs. There are still several antibiotics which are effective in vitro against staphylococci, while gentamicin, collistin and cotrimoxazole are the only antibiotics displaying more general activity against gram-negative "problem" bacteria. Nevertheless, strains from general practice show a good response in vitro, even to older antibiotics, despite the fact that these have been widely used for decades in general practice.
TI  - Effect of active and passive antibacterial immunization on skin allograft survival in rabbits.
AB  - The effect of active and passive antibacterial immunization on transplantation immunity was investigated in rabbits. Immunization with dead bacterial vaccines prepared from E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudmonas aeruginosa had no effect on skin allograft survival, whereas immunization with vaccines prepared from streptococcal and staphylococcal strains shortened allograft survival. Similar results were obtained with specific antisera against individual microbial species. Skin allografts survived in rabbits treated with antisera against E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the same manner as in untreated controls, whereas allograft survival was shortened with antisera against streptococci or staphylococci. The possible mechanism of the stimulatory effect of Gram-positive cocci on transplantation immunity is discussed and the possibilities of using active and passive antibacterial immunication in clinical transplantation are considered.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefaclor (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study was conducted on the in vitro activity of cefaclor and other  oral cephalosporins against a large number of freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The activity of cefaclor against gram-positive pathogens is very similar to that of cephalexin. The action of cefaclor against Streptococcus pneumoniae is superior. Cefaclor is the most active antibiotic against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and is also more active than cephalexin and cephradine against non-beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - [The distribution of minimal inhibitory concentrations of recently introduced cephalosporins in multiresistant strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spec. as revealed by zone sizes of a standardized agar diffusion test (author's transl)].
AB  - Strains of a species were divided into two groups according to the number of resistances (less than or equal to 4, greater than or equal to 5) using 10 standard chemotherapeutics regularly examined, the new cephalosporins not being among them. These groups of less than or equal to 4- and greater than or equal to 5-fold resistant strains were compared for each cephalosporin tested (Fig. 1). The most different distributions of zone diameters (of both groups) were seen in Cephalothin, whereas in Cefoxitin and - with little limitations - also in Cefuroxime in the main these distributions did not differ; they covered the same field. The distributions of Cefaclor and Cefamandole took an intermediate position. With respect to the two groups similar observations were made for E. coli, proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spec. The differences between the two groups were most marked in Klebsiella strains. E. coli exhibited the smallest differences (Fig 1). On the assumption that the distribution of zone diameters reflect that of MIC's it can be concluded that nearly all of the Cefaclor- and Cefamandole-sensitive multiresistant strains have more elevated MIC's than those with only less than or equal to 4 resistances. On the other hand it must not be expected that MIC'S OF Cefoxitin and Cefuroxim are rising in multiresistant strains. It could be demonstrated that the different qualities of the recently introduced cephalosporins revealed in multiresistant strains can be explained by different dependences on mechanisms of Cephalothin-resistance (Fig. 2). This resistance is much more frequent in greater than or equal to 5-fold resistant strains. Recommendations for clinical use derived from these results are discussed.
TI  - [Comparison of four recently introduced cephalosporins with respect to probability of resistance in multiresistant strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spec. (author's transl)].
AB  - Strains with the same number of resistances were arranged in so-called resistance classes. Nine classes of resistance (0 to greater to or equal to 8) were formed by means of ten standard chemotherapeutics; the four new cephalosporins were excluded. For every resistance class frequency of cephalosporinresistance was described as coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 (Fig. 1). In Cephalothin the coefficients were markedly rising only in 6 (7)-fold resistant strains of the species examined. Similar but somewhat reduced rising of coefficients was also observed in Cefaclor and Cefamandole. In Cefaclor this is particularly evident for E. coli, whereas in Cefamandole, it concerns Klebsiella spec. In the other species rising of coefficients of Cefaclor and Cefamandole are less marked. The probability of restance in multiresistant strains are therefore distinguished more clearly from that of Cephalothin. Cefuroxime and Cefoxitin take a special position because the probability of resistance does not rise in multiresistant strains. The coefficients of Cefoxitin do not show any recognizable dependance on multiresistance. For clinical purpose the following conclusions can be derived: Because of their effectiveness in multiresistant strains Cefoxitin and Cefuroxime are suitable for empiric use in intensive care units where many multiresistant Klebsiella-strains are to be expected. Cefamandole on the other hand is characterized by a rising probability of resistance in multiresistant strains. Therefore it should only be given after antibiotic testing. Cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin, will be introduced specially for outpatients where multiresistant strains are rarely found.
TI  - [Photodynamic effect of quinacrine on bacteria].
AB  - The acridine dye quinacrine (QA) was tested with regard to the photodynamic action on bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli). The absorption maximum of the yellow dye QA ist in contrary to the photodynamically active dyes methylene blue (MB) and thiopyronine (TP) situated in the short wave region of the visible spectrum. Using for illumination a common light source--they have in general a weak emission in the short wave region--relatively high concentrations of QA are necessary for photodynamic action, and the difference between photodynamic inactivation and toxic effect is small. Using that light source XBO 500 with nearly equal emission in the range from 400 to 700 nm, a distinct photodynamic action of QA results. Comparing the photodynamic action of QA with those of MB and TP, QA has a low photodynamic effect, and the kinetics of inactivation of bacteria with QA is completely different from those obtained with the dyes MB and TP.

TI  - Endotoxin in germfree, gnotobiotic, or conventional-flora Sprague-Dawley rats.
AB  - The Limulus assay for bacterial endotoxin was performed on serum and (or) plasma  from animals monoassociated with Clostridium species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Candida albicans. Plasma from animals monoassociated with the gram-negative bacteria or C. albicans consistently showed a positive Limulus test while conventional-flora controls, germfree rats, and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with gram-positive bacteria or E. agglomerans were negative. Germfree and conventional rats were injected (intraperitoneal (i.p.)) with Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although no endotoxin was detectable in either group prior to the injection, by 1 h post injection endotoxin was in the plasma of all groups. The germfree rats appeared to clear the LPS quicker than their conventional-flora counterparts. Generally, LPS-injected rats (conventional and germfree) showed clumping and decreased number of platelets, a decrease in their lymphocyte counts, and increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts.
TI  - HR 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  - HR 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus spp. (indole positive), Enterobacter spp., Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In every comparison, except that with the last organism, HR 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. All three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, HR 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. HR 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against Haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against Bacteriodes fragilis. HR 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. HR 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against S. pyogenes; against Lancefield group D, penicillin was 32 times as active as HR 756. HR 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (P. aeruginosa and group D streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. A series of seven transfers of selected strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa through medium containing HR 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. Resistance to HR 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.
TI  - [Susceptibility testing with the autobac system (author's transl)].
AB  - The Autobac I provides an automated method for the rapid measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility of fast growing pathogenic microorganisms. To check instrument accuracy, 477 cultures were tested by the Bauer-Kirby method for comparison. According to the DIN limits, the results were comparable in 81.8%, whereas within the NCCLS limits the agreement was 86.5%. The discrepancy was found to be due to incorrect disc mass and different limits of inhibitory zone diameters. Another reason for disagreement seemed to be the incubation time, since its influence on the results varied when different bacterium/antibiotic combinations were used.
TI  - Stomach as source of bacteria colonising respiratory tract during artificial ventilation.
AB  - 10 adults had intermittent positive-pressure ventilation for 3--34 days. All 10 had paralytic ileus. Microbial overgrowth in the stomach was found in 9 patients (bacterial in 7 and fungal in 2); gram-negative bacteria predominated. The trachea invariably became colonised by bacteria, mainly gram-negative organisms. In 3 instances the gram-negative bacteria were found in the stomach before they appeared in the tracheal aspirate, and in 1 case the pathogen originated in the faeces.

TI  - In vitro activity of HR 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. The geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for different isolates of Escherichia coli (100 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (84), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), Proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive Proteus species (9), Salmonella species (19), Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. Its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa but not against K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. HR 756 was found to be bactericidal to E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus species. Although the MICs of the tested S. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of HR 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.

TI  - Urinary tract infection in general practice.
AB  - In three studies, 616 patients (610 female and six male) presented with symptoms  suggesting urinary tract infection (UTI). Of these, 321 had greater than 100 X 10(6) bacteria per litre in a midstream urine sample. None of the presenting symptoms could be considered to be a reliable indicator of bacteriuria. Ninety percent of infected urines and 44 percent of uninfected urines had a raised white cell concentration. Escherichia coli was the most common infecting organism (71.3 percent). Next were Gram positive cocci at 15.6 percent, Proteus mirabilis (7.5 percent), and Klebsiella-Enterobacter species (0.7 percent). At follow-up over 30 days 25.6 percent of patients initially infected again had infected urine. The organisms isolated from initial MSUs were sensitive to most antibacterial agents by disc-sensitivity testing. The expected urine levels of drugs used in the study greatly exceeded the measured minimum inhibitory concentration.
TI  - SCE-963, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - SCE-963 {7beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[({1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-  1H-tetrazol-5-yl}thio)methyl]-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid}, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, showed excellent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter species, and Citrobacter freundii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of SCE-963 against most strains of clinically isolated Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were within the range of 0.2 to 0.78 mug/ml. These activities were about 10 times more potent than those of cefazolin, cephaloridine, and cephalothin. Variations in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the cephalosporin, but the inoculum size elicited a considerable effect on the activity of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteria. SCE-963 exerted bactericidal and bacteriolytic effects on Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. The pronounced in vitro activity was reflected in the remarkable protection in mice infected with a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus morganii, and Proteus rettgeri. The protective effects of SCE-963 in mice infected with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. vulgaris varied according to the challenge dose. The activity of SCE-963 was far more potent when the drug was administered parenterally rather than orally.

TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. X.  Adhesive properties of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis: lack of correlation with urinary pathogenicity.
AB  - The ability of a bacterial strain to adhere to the vaginal mucosa and the mucosa  of the urinary conduits seems to be important in the pathogenesis of urinary infection. Bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells was measured in vitro for 37 strains of Escherichia coli and 18 strains of Proteus mirabilis isolated from the anus, bladder and renal pelvis. No correlation could be demonstrated between the adhesive properties of a bacterial strain and its clinical pathogenicity, suggesting that host factors determining bacterial adherence are more important than bacterial adhesive factors in determining susceptibility to urinary infections.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of urine of paraplegic patients receiving methenamine  mandelate.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of urine collected from adult male paraplegics ingesting methenamine mandelate (MM) was evaluated. The in vitro bacterial growth in urine from these patients was inhibited when the free formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration was 10 to 22 microgram per ml. When the HCHO concentration was in the region of 28 microgram per ml or greater, bactericidal effect became apparent. Urine containing 1323 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.9 when freshly voided had sufficient HCHO to be bacteriostatic. Urine containing at least 1740 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.1 or less when freshly voided was bactericidal. The latter concentration of MM in urine was usually achieved when the patient ingested 4 g of MM per day in divided doses and the intake of fluid was not excessive. Under some circumstances an individual receiving MM without an additional acidifying agent may produce urine with a pH low enough to release sufficient HCHO to exert a useful antibacterial effect. However, supplementary acidification with ammonium chloride produced marked lowering of the urinary pH in all patients receiving MM, resulting in bactericidal levels of HCHO.

TI  - Differentiation of Serratia marcescens and Serratia liquefaciens by tests for lipase and phospholipase production.
AB  - The production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the Enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. Most strains of Serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of Serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. Enterobacter spp. (25 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (15 strains), Citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and Proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of Enterobacter cloacae, two of Proteus mirabilis and three of Proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. It is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for DNAase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.

TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of BL-S786 compared with those of  other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro activity of BL-S786, a new parenterally semisynthetic cephalosporin, was investigated against 570 bacterial isolates. BL-S786 inhibited most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella. It inhibited some Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, but it was less active against these later species than was cefamandole, cefuroxime, or cefoxitin. It was not active against Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Bacteroides fragilis. BL-S786 was the least active new cephalosporin tested against staphylococci and was less active than cephalothin against streptococcal species. The activity of BL-S786 was not altered by the type of assay medium nor by 50% serum. The size of the test inoculum altered the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for inhibition of some organisms, particularly those with Richmond type I beta-lactamases. BL-S786 was not hydrolyzed by the R-factor-mediated, Richmond type III beta-lactamase, but it was hydrolyzed by type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Nitrosamine formation in bladder infections and its role in the etiology of bladder cancer.
AB  - Dimethylnitrosamine, a powerful carcinogen, is produced in the urine of patients  with urinary tract infections of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli when nitrite is present. Treatment with tetracycline antibiotics does not enhance the concentration of this carcinogen but, rather, sharply reduces it. The results emphasize the importance of proper antibiotic therapy for the infections to reduce the possibility of the subsequent development of bladder cancer.
TI  - Extension of a chromosome linkage group of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Mating procedures for detection of mobilization of the Proteus mirabilis chromosome were re-investigated. The chromosome was mobilized by plasmid D, the previously used hybrid between plasmids P-lac and R1drd19. About a 40-fold increase in recombinant recovery correlated with the absence of swarming during mating and a lower temperature of incubation. The modification introduced was that conjugation was allowed to proceed on a non-selective supplemented minimal medium at 30 degrees C before washing and plating on selective media. Final incubation was also at 30 degrees C. This technique enabled eight additional chromosomal markers to be mapped. Polarized transfer of the chromosome was shown by gradient of transmission experiments using a previously described marker as reference, by linkage analysis with reference to proximal and distal markers and (less successfully) by interrupted mating on solid medium. Markers of plasmid D transferred at high frequency to all recombinants. The plasmid was stable in recombinants and could transfer itself and chromosomal markers of the new hosts in further matings. Resulting recombination of markers occurred at usual frequencies. The marker order, his-1, ser-2, ura-2, pyrB1, trp-3, cysA1, ade-2, ilv-2, cysG1, gly-1, cysC1, argA2, metF2, nalA1, thr-1, leuB2, did not resemble the order of these markers in Escherichia coli.

TI  - Azlocillin and mezlocillin: new ureido penicillins.
AB  - The activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin, new semisynthetic ureido penicillins, was investigated and compared with that of other known beta-lactam antibiotics. At a concentration of 25 mug/ml, azlocillin inhibited 74% of Enterobacter, 97% of Proteus mirabilis, 64% of Citrobacter, 91% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 82% of Bacteroides strains tested. Mezlocillin inhibited 86% of Shigella, 96% of Enterobacter, 80% of indole-positive Proteus, 88% of Bacteroides, and 63% of Pseudomonas strains tested. Azlocillin was more active against Pseudomonas than was ticarcillin, carbenicillin, or mezlocillin. Mezlocillin was more active than carbenicillin and ampicillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Serratia, and Bacteroides. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were less active than cefazolin against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains but more active than cefazolin against Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia strains. Both compounds showed activity equivalent to that of cefoxitin against Bacteroides isolates. Both agents were destroyed by many of the beta-lactamases from gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Coding of stable 4S RNA molecules by the resistance factor R1.
AB  - With the aid of DNA-RNA hybridization experiments it was shown that an E. coli strain harbouring the resistance factor R1 contains small, stable RNA species which are capable of annealing with the DNA of this R-factor. At a higher hybridization temperature RNA molecules form the isogenic, sensitive strain could also hybridize to the R1-DNA. These RNA-species were again detected if the RNA was extracted from P. mirabilis carrying this plasmid. The fact that sulfur-labelled RNA also hybridized to the plasmid DNA seems to indicate that some of these molecules are tRNAs.
TI  - Pharmacology and efficacy of netilmicin.
AB  - Twenty-six patients, 20 to 77 years of age, were treated with netilmicin, mean dose 2 mg/kg every 8 h intramuscularly or in a 20-min intravenous infusion. The mean serum half-lives in patients with creatinine clearances of >/=90 ml/min and 60 to 90 ml/min were 3.2 and 3.4 h, respectively. In patients with serum creatinines of </=1.4 mg/100 ml and creatinine clearances of >/=60 ml/min, mean serum levels were 9.0 and 1.2 mug/ml, respectively, 5 to 15 min and 7.5 h post-intravenous infusion, and 7.1 and 1.7 mug/ml, respectively, 1 and 8 h post-intramuscular injection. Twenty-five patients had acute pyelonephritis; 7 of the 25 had bacteremia. The infecting bacteria were Escherichia coli (15), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Enterobacter hafniae (1), and both Proteus rettgeri and Proteus morganii (1). All were inhibited by 6.3 mug of netilmicin per ml, except for the P. rettgeri, which required 25 mug/ml for inhibition. Of 23 patients who could be evaluated, 19 were bacteriologically and clinically cured at follow-up. Of the remaining four, one relapsed, two became reinfected, and one was lost to follow-up. Five patients developed nephrotoxicity; two of the five had previous renal insufficiency. Three patients, one with abnormal renal function, developed ototoxicity detected only with audiograms. These studies suggest that netilmicin is effective in serious gram-negative bacillary infections, but is nephrotoxic and ototoxic in humans.
TI  - Synergy of azlocillin and mezlocillin combined with aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins.
AB  - Synergistic activity between both azlocillin and mezlocillin and aminoglycosides  or cefazolin could be demonstrated by checkerboard dilution, isobologram, and killing curve techniques. Azlocillin and mezlocillin combined with gentamicin, netilmicin, or amikacin were synergistic against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Serratia, and indole-positive Proteus. Synergy was observed with isolates that were susceptible or resistant to azlocillin or mezlocillin. Synergy was seen most often when azlocillin or mezlocillin were combined with amikacin, gentamicin, or netilmicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination of mezlocillin and an aminoglycoside produced synergy more often than did carbenicillin plus an aminoglycoside. No antagonism was seen when aminoglycoside antibiotics were combined with azlocillin or mezlocillin. Cefazolin was synergistic against Pseudomonas, Providencia, P. mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, and Escherichia coli, when combined with azlocillin or mezlocillin. However, the combination of either agent with cefazolin was antagonistic when tested against selected indole-positive Proteus and Enterobacter isolates.
TI  - Clinical experience with cefamandole for treatment of serious bone and joint infections.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 30 patients (from 18 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. Five of the subjects were children. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 2 to 12 g daily for five to 44 days. Twenty-six of the 30 patients responded satisfactorily. Fourteen of the fifteen infections due to Staphylococcus aureus were among the successful cases. Other pathogens were streptococci, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated in patients in this series. Studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Further investigation of cefmandole in the treatment of bone and joint infections is warranted.

AB  - The biosynthesis of a Proteus mirabilis outer membrane protein of molecular weight of approximately 7,000 was found to be relatively resistant to puromycin and rifampin, as is the case for the Escherichia coli liporotein. Furthermore, the existence of the lipoprotein in P. mirabilis was indicated by a comparison of the amino acid compositions of the purified free and bound forms of this protein with those of the E. coli free and bound lipoproteins.
TI  - Structure, function, and regulation of Escherichia coli rRNA in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Escherichia coli rRNA genes have been introduced into Proteus mirabilis on an F-prime factor (F'14). A portion of the ribosomes in the resulting merodiploid consist of E. coli rRNA and P. mirabilis ribosomal proteins. These ribosomes are structurally similar to normal P. mirabilis or E. coli ribosomes and exhibit many or all of the functional properties of normal ribosomes. The accumulation of E. coli rRNA in the merodiploid is regulated in a way similar to the the regulation of P. mirabilis rRNA.
TI  - Management and microbiology of cutaneous abscesses.
AB  - Cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. Non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. Bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. Staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. Incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. Fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. Patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and Gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. The Gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure S aureus. Incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. Since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and Gram-stained smear are unnecessary.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  - Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. Gram-positive cocci, except for Streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin G-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. Minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. Most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, Salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. Susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. Strains of Pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of apalcillin (PC-904) against gram-negative bacilli, especially ampicillin-, carbenicillin-, and gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Apalcillin (PC-904) is active against carbenicillin- and ampicillin-resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli. Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains highly resistant to carbenicillin (>/=3,200 mug/ml), half of them were susceptible to PC-904 at a concentration of 50 to 1,600 mug/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentration of PC-904 against P. aeruginosa strains resistant to carbenicillin (400 to 1,600 mug/ml) ranged from 3.1 to 25 mug/ml. Ampicillin- and carbenicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains were similarly susceptible to PC-904. However, drug resistance to PC-904 was already apparent among some strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and P. morganii, recently isolated in Japan; i.e., 4, 35, 32, 4, 6, and 14% of strains isolated were resistant. PC-904 was more active, on the other hand, than ampicillin and carbenicillin against antibiotic-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae and also showed high activity against most species of Pseudomonadaceae, especially P. cepacia and P. aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of PC-904 were greatly affected by inoculum size when the organisms tested were strains producing large amounts of beta-lactamase.
TI  - Chloramphenicol for oral treatment of canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - Chloramphenicol was administered orally for 7 to 14 days to 83 dogs with urinary  tract infections. The daily dosage of 99 mg/kg (45 mg/lb) was divided into 3 equal parts and administered at 8-hour intervals. Response to treatment (negative urine culture after treatment) varied from 84% (11 to 13) for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus to 51% (24 of 47) for those caused by Escherichia coli; 82% (14 of 17) of the infections caused by Streptococcus spp and 63% (7 of 11) of those caused by Proteus mirabilis responded to treatment. These 4 species comprised 88% of the bacteria isolated from the dogs.
TI  - Head-space gas liquid chromatography for rapid detection of Escherichia coli and  Proteus mirabilis in urine.
AB  - Measuring ethanol formed from arabinose by Escherichia coli and dimethyl disulphide formed from methionine by Proteus mirabilis is a rapid way of detecting these organisms in the urine. Ethanol and dimethyl disulphide are detected by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Since sedimented organisms and not whole urine are used the method is not subject to interference from compounds within the urine. When it was tested on 122 samples of urine, 94 from patients with suspected urinary infection and 28 supposedly uninfected control specimens, the results correlated well with viable counts by a conventional bacteriological method. As well as being rapid (results available in four hours) the method is reliable, easy to use, and could be automated. It now requires extensive testing in a hospital laboratory.

TI  - Activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin against gram-negative organisms: comparison with other penicillins.
AB  - The activities of azlocillin and mezlocillin were compared with those of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and pirbenicillin against a wide range of gram-negative organisms. The two new drugs were considerably more active than carbenicillin against Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli. Carbenicillin was twice as active against Proteus mirabilis as mezlocillin and four times as active as azlocillin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, azlocillin was eight times as active as carbenicillin. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were twice as active as carbenicillin against Bacteroides fragilis, and these drugs showed a high degree of activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies with BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against 90 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes, were studied by using an agar dilution procedure. Comparison of geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentrations showed that BL-S786 was half as active as cefamandole against Enterobacter species, 2 to 4 times more active than cefamandole against all other species, and 4 to 25 times more active than cefoxitin against all species. In vivo experiments employed acute protection tests in infected mice, using five isolates each of the five genera. Drugs were administered intramuscularly in two doses 3 h apart at dosages of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per mouse. In most instances, BL-S786 was the most efficacious drug, being some 1.3 to 9.1 times more active than cefoxitin in all experiments and 1.5 to 8.7 times more active than cefamandole in most experiments. BL-S786 and cefamandole were comparable in activity in experiments with E. aerogenes, whereas BL-S786 was superior in experiments with E. cloacae.

Synthetic hydrogel can be combined with a totally defined synthetic amino acid medium to yield a reproducible, totally defined, synthetic solid medium without the antagonistic or booster effects of some components of agar. Such a medium could be used as a reference medium for susceptibility testing.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin was slightly more active against Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. Piperacillin was active against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae including the Klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. The activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. Most striking was its activity on Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain P. aeruginosa strains. A complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. However, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - PC-904, a new semisynthetic penicillin.
AB  - Sodium 6{d(-)-alpha(4-hydroxyl-1,5 naphthyridine-3-carboxamido)phenylacetamido} penicillanate (PC-904) is a new semisynthetic penicillin with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. At a concentration of 1.56 mug/ml, it inhibited 100% of isolates of Proteus mirabilis, 89% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 67% of Escherichia coli, and 45% of Enterobacter spp. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, it inhibited 75% of Klebsiella spp. and 67% of Serratia marcescens. PC-904 failed to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacilli when large inocula were used. Some differences were noted when organisms were tested in different media or at different hydrogen ion concentrations. It is more active than mezlocillin, azlocillin, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and amoxicillin against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and P. aeruginosa.

AB  - An analysis was carried out of 640 patients treated because of urolithiasis at the Urological Clinic of the Medical Academy in Warsaw in the years 1971--1974. Factors conducive to stone formation were analyzed. In infected urolithiasis, different bacterial floras were found in men and women. The importance of infections acquired in hospital by patients is emphasized. In primarily uninfected urolithiasis there were 35 per cent recurrences, as against 53 per cent recurrences in infected urolithiasis.
TI  - An overview of results of world-wide clinical trials with cefadroxil.
AB  - Cefadroxil, a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, is absorbed similarly by fasted and non-fasted subjects, produces sustained serum levels and is eliminated at a relatively slow rate. These pharmacokinetic properties permit less frequent and more convenient dosage scheduling than cephalexin and cephradine and consequently greater patient compliance. Cefadroxil was evaluated for safety in 1051 patients and for efficacy in 1030 patients. Overall it achieved a 91.8% rate of clinical success resulting from 881 complete cures and sixty-five clinical cures. Among 363 patients with respiratory tract infections and 471 patients with genito-urinary tract infections, cefadroxil treatment produced 97.5% and 84.5% clinical success, respectively. In the remaining infectious diseases treated, cefadroxil therapy resulted in 99.0% clinical success. Cefadroxil eradicated 87% of 1110 pathogens isolated, among which the most predominant pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Drug-related side-effects were reported in 7.2% of the patients.
TI  - [Occult reflux (author's transl)].
AB  - Level diagnosis repeatedly performed in patients without roentgenologically demonstrable reflux demonstrated bladder bacteriuria in 80% of the cases. The remaining 20% had supravesical bacteriuria. We called this occult reflux, if reinfection was demonstrated. Contamination of the upper tract by occult reflux can, but must not induce pyelonephritis. Bilateral antireflux surgery frequently eliminates occult reflux of bacteria, so this seems a debatable method of treatment.

TI  - In vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cefaclor (Lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (BL-S640, SK&F 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. They were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. Cefaclor and cefatrizine were found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. Only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. Cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the cephalosporins were particularly active against Enterobacter cloacae. Both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against Proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive Proteus species.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro antibacterial activity of three oral cephalosporins: cefaclor, cephalexin, and cephradine.
AB  - Cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin, was compared in vitro with cephalexin and cephradine against 233 organisms. Evaluations were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar using two inoculum sizes. In agar, cefaclor had greater antibacterial activity than either cephalexin or cephradine against isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi. All three drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of enterococci, Enterobacter species, and indole-positive Proteus. Cefaclor, however, did exhibit the greatest activity of the three antibiotics against these organisms. Although there was wide variability with respect to test parameters, the broth results generally paralleled the agar results. In nutrient broth a clear separation of the results with these three cephalosporins was seen with K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. typhi. Cefaclor was the most active, cephalexin had intermediate activity, and cephradine was the least active. From the data obtained in this in vitro study, it can be concluded that cefaclor, which has a substituted chloro group attached to the molecule, had increased antibacterial activity over cephalexin and cephradine. Comparative clinical trials with cefaclor will determine whether the differences outlined above are of clinical significance.
TI  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic III. In vitro evaluation.
AB  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic, exerts a comparatively potent antimicrobial activity against gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus groups (except Pr. morganii), Serratia marcescens and the Neisseria groups. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of nocardicin A against clinical isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was about twice that of carbenicillin. The mean MICs of nocardicin A for Pr. mirabilis, Pr. rettgeri and Pr. inconstans ranged from 3.13 to 12.5 microgram/ml and were 25 similar to 50 microgram/ml for Pr. vulgaris. Nocardicin A in concentrations of 12.5 similar to 50 microgram/ml inhibited 30 strains (48 percent) of S. marcescens usually resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, nocardicin A had no significant in vitro activity against Staphylococci and Escherichia coli. No cross-resistance was seen between nocardicin A and other beta-lactam antibiotics. This antibiotic was stable to beta-lactamase. The in vitro activity of nocardicin A against Ps. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis was greatly influenced by the assay media used. Nocardicin A was bactericidal and appeared to act synergistically with serum bactericidal factors against Ps. aeruginosa and with polymorphonuclear leukocytes against Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli and Pr. vulgaris. The bactericidal activity of nocardicin A against the above 3 organisms, therefore, increased markedly in the presence of fresh serum and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Temperature sensitive R plasmids isolated from Proteus strains.
AB  - Out of 32 R plasmids isolated from Proteus strains, 17 were found to be temperature sensitive with respect to inheritance in E. coli cells. They were fi- and classified into incompatibility group T or V. Cells carrying T group Rms273 plasmid were temperature sensitive with respect to growth and conjugal transfer in both E. coli and Proteus. The V group YOR-10 plasmid was stable in Proteus even at 42 C. However, the loss frequency of YOR-10 plasmid in E. coli reached 100% after 4 hr of incubation at 42 C, in spite of stable inheritance at 25 C. Conjugal transfer of the YOR-10 plasmid in E. coli was also strongly inhibited at 42 C. It has been concluded that instability of V group R plasmids in E. coli is due to their thermosensitive inheritance in the progeny cells at high temperatures.
TI  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic V. In vivo evaluation.
AB  - Nocardicin A is a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic which provides a potent therapeutic effect in mice experimentally infected with gram-negative bacilli. When given subcutaneously to mice, the therapeutic effect of the drug was stronger than had been anticipated from in vitro studies. Nocardicin A was more potent in therapeutic effect than carbenicillin against infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris, Pr. rettgeri and Pr. inconstans, and was similar in effect to carbenicillin against infections due to Escherichia coli in mice. In addition, nocardicin A proved to be active against infections due to Serratia marcescens and other organisms resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. When nocardicin A was given subcutaneously to mice, blood and hepatic levels of the drug were higher than those of carbenicillin.
TI  - [Microheterogeneity of R plasmid coded beta-lactamases in analytical isoelectric  focusing (author's transl)].
AB  - Analytical isoelectric focusing of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases in polyacrylamide gels gives rise to several satellite bands in addition to one major active band (microheterogeneity). When the R plasmids are transferred by conjugation into 4 different bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi-murium, Proteus mirabilis) the position of the main band remains constant, but the number and position of the satellite bands are changed. Furthermore, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of several beta-lactamines are also changed when the plasmids are transferred between these different host strains. These facts suggest that the bacterial host might modify the physical structure and the activity of plasmid-determined beta-lactamases. They also suggest that identification of beta-lactamases and comparison of their isoelectric focusing patterns should always be carried out using the same bacterial host strain.
TI  - Cinoxacin: new antimicrobial agent for urinary tract infections.
AB  - One hundred forty-six patients with recurrent urinary tract infections were treated with 500 mg. of cinoxacin twice daily for seven to fourteen days. Satisfactory clinical response occurred in 94 per cent. Of the 100 patients with significant pretherapy bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(4) organisms/ml. of urine), 65 had complicated infections. Approximately the same per cent of patients with (90 per cent) as without (94 per cent) complicating conditions had a satisfactory clinical response to treatment. The pathogen was eliminated in a higher percentage of patients without underlying disease (90 versus 80 per cent), and infections recurred less frequently in this group (3 versus 14 per cent). Emergence of resistance by initially susceptible organisms during the course of therapy occurred in 4 of 76 patients (5 per cent). A satisfactory clinical response occurred in all 46 patients with an initial colony count of less than 10(4) organisms/ml. urine. Only 1 patient in this group was a bacteriologic failure. Adverse effects of a relatively wild nature were seen in 4 of 146 patients (2.7 per cent). Successful eradication of 12 of 23 urinary infections in patients whose pathogens were resistant to the 30-microgram. cinoxacin disk suggests that the 100-microgram. disk may be more realistic for determining bacterial susceptibility by the disk diffusion method in view of the very high urinary concentration of the drug.
TI  - [A new type of ointment base: investigations on its antimicrobial properties (author's transl)].
AB  - A new ointment base (PEN 32) consisting of polyalcohols prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi in concentrations above 25% (mg/mg). In a concentrated form the ointment base exhibited excellent bactericidal and fungicidal effects in vitro. This property enables the ointment base to be employed without preservatives.
TI  - Is your dosage really necessary? Antibiotic dosage in urinary infection.
AB  - Dense cultures of bacteria were exposed to changing concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in an in-vitro model of the urinary bladder. The results suggest that uncomplicated urinary infection may respond to lower doses than are usually given without compromising the success of subsequent treatment in those cases in which such minimal treatment fails.
TI  - A new pencillin with anti-klebsiella activity: 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new semi-synthetic penicillin, CP-35,587, 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam, was investigated against 496 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and 113 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. All of the gram-positive cocci were sensitive to CP-35,587 except penicillin G resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. This antibiotic inhibited a majority of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis at a concentration of 6.25 microgram/ml. Also, approximately half of the isolates of Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter spp. were inhibited at a concentration of 12.5 microgram/ml. CP-35,587 was inactive when high concentrations of organisms were used as inocula. CP-35,587 was more active than mezlocillin, azlocillin, amoxicillin, ticarcillin and carbenicillin against isolates of K. pneumoniae, but other penicillins were more acte than CP-35,587 against other species of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefaclor, cephalothin, and cephalexin against 261 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae was compared. Cefaclor and cephalexin were about equally active against S. aureus. Cefaclor was the most active cephalosporin against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The effect on the antimicrobial activity using a relatively high and low inoculum was pronounced for cefaclor when compared with that of cephalothin.
TI  - [5 years of bacteriological analysis. Results and observations].
AB  - The Authors examined the bacteriological analysis carried our during a period of  five years (June 1971-June 1976), and pointed out the percentage of positivity and sensibility to antibiotics of the bacteria isolated. On a total of 8,263 analysis, 4,327 coprocultures and 2,076 urinocultures have been made, thus occupying the first places in frequency. 195 patogenous enterobacteria have been isolated from coprocultures, corresponding to a positivity of 4.50%. As for the urinocultures positivity reached 43.25%; the germs most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The Authors isolated in the same period 17 strains of Myc. tuberculosis from 115 samples of expectoration (14.7%) and 27 strains from 216 samples of urine (12.5%). By recommending antibiograms, the Authors suggest that the most effective antibiotics against enterobacteria responsable of infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tract are nalidixic acid and furadantin, cloramfenicolo was ineffective against the isolated Salmonella strains. As for Gram-positive germs some results have been obtained with cefalotine, rifampicin, and cefazolin.
TI  - [Transmission of the R-plasmids and expression of their genes in Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - Resistance markers to individual antibiotics are transmitted in E. coli with the  same frequency in the shape of a uniform linkage group, and in Proteus mirabilis--with a different one. Possibly in Proteus mirabilis plasmide R6 dissociated, this being expressed in a different incidence of transconjugates, characterized by a different set of antibiotic resistance genes. Tetracyclin resistance gene can be transmitted in P. mirabilis without being bound with other resistance determinants and with the functioning Tra-operon. The expression of individual antibiotic resistance genes of plasmide R6 in P. mirabilis differed, i.e. tetracycline resistance was inducible, and to kanamycin and chloramphenicol--constitutional. The level of expression of the gene controlling the tetracycline resistance was in noninduced condition in P. mirabilis, lower than in E. coli, P. mirabilis containing no R-factor possessed an inducible resistance mechanism to tetracycline, as in case of P. mirabilis strains containing R-factors.

TI  - Terminus region of the chromosome in Escherichia coli inhibits replication forks.
AB  - Induction of prophage P2sig5 at 42 degrees caused replication of the bacterial chromosome in a dnaA mutant of Escherichia coli. The P2sig5 is integrated in this strain near the metG locus, which is at min 47 on the genetic map. The regions of the chromosome replicated after prophage induction have been determined by means of DNA-DNA hybridization with various DNAs obtained from Proteus mirabilis/E. coli F' merogenotes and from lambda specialized transducing phage. The replication was initiated at the prophage site and was bidirectional. Most of the replication occurred in a counterclockwise direction on the genetic map, and the replication quickly proceeded to the aroD locus (min 37). The replication forks were retarded between aroD and rac (min 31) loci, although the rac locus was finally replicated. A more severe inhibition of replication occurred between the rac and trp (min 27) loci. It is proposed that the replication terminus is near the rac locus and that the terminus inhibits replication forks.
TI  - Assessment of technique for rapid detection of Escherichia coli and Proteus species in urine by head-space gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - A test depending on the production of ethanol by Escherichia coli from lactose and dimethyl disulfide by Proteus spp. from methionine in the early exponential phase of growth and the detection of these products by head-space gas-liquid chromatography has been applied to 75 specimens of urine selected to provide the most stringent trial of the test. The test was found to be rapid and reliable for the commonest findings in the microbiological examination of urine. In 3 to 4 h it detected "significant" numbers (greater than 10(5)/ml) of E. coli or of Proteus mirabilis or P. inconstans A, identified as Proteus spp., in 23 urines. It recorded the absence of infection from 32 urines containing borderline or "not significant" numbers of any organism. Significant numbers of other organisms in 13 urines were not mistaken for E. coli or Proteus spp. However, the test was less successful for some less common findings. Klebsiella ozenae in significant numbers in one urine was mistaken for E. coli. P. morganii in significant numbers in one urine was not detected. E. coli or P. mirabilis mixed with significant numbers of another organism were not detected in four out of five urines. The technique is simple and could be automated. It appears to merit more extensive trial in a hospital laboratory and further development to detect and correctly identify more species that cause urinary tract infections.
TI  - Development of specific tests for rapid detection of Escherichia coli and all species of Proteus in urine.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis was distinguishable from Escherichia coli and from several other species that may be associated with urinary tract infections when grown in a nutrient medium supplemented with 0.1 M L-methionine by the formation of large amounts of dimethyl disulfide and methyl mercaptan, which were detected by head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). E. coli could be detected by the same HS-GLC technique by ethanol production from methionine peptone water enriched with 1% either lactose or arabinose but not by any product from 10 amino acids tested. Ethanol from lactose was detected early in the exponential phase of growth. Significant numbers, 10(5) or more per ml, of E. coli in urine could be detected in about 5 h by ethanol production from an unshaken culture of urine in lactose methionine peptone water buffered at pH 7.2 (urine test medium); only a trace of dimethyl disulfide was produced. Significant numbers of P. mirabilis in urine could be detected in 4 h by dimethyl disulfide production and in 5 h by methyl mercaptan production from a shaken culture of urine in urine test medium; no ethanol was produced. Incubation of urine specimens in the test medium followed by examination by HS-GLC is proposed as a rapid method of detecting whether or not the urine contains significant numbers of E. coli or a species of Proteus.
TI  - The effect of amniotic fluid on bacterial growth in three population groups.
AB  - Eighty-five amniotic fluid from women of three racial groups in the third trimester of pregnancy were each tested for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Seventy-six per cent of fluid samples from white patients were inhibitory, while the corresponding figures for Africans and Indians were 33 and 52, respectively. Of 19 African fluid samples tested against E. coli only, one proved inhibitory.
TI  - Penicillin G or ampicillin for oral treatment of canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - Penicillin G or ampicillin was administered orally to 144 dogs with urinary tract infections. The daily dosage of penicillin G ranged from 110,000 to 165,000 U/kg (50,000-75,000 U/lb), and the dosage of ampicillin varied from 77 to 110 mg/kg (35-50 mg/lb). The daily dose of each antibiotic was divided into 3 or 4 doses and given at approximately 8- or 6-hour intervals for 10 to 14 days. Response to treatment, based on results of urine culture, varied from no response for infections caused by Pseudomonas spp to 100% response for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. About 50% of infections caused by Escherichia coli were eliminated, as were about 80% of those due to Proteus mirabilis. Mean concentrations of penicillin G and ampicillin in urines collected at 6-hour intervals after oral administration to clinically normal adult dogs were approximately 350 microgram/ml for both drugs when each was given individually in daily dosages (divided QID) of 55 mg/kg (25 mg/lb). The minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin G for a number of the bacteria isolated from the urine of the infected dogs was compared with the results of the clinical trials and to the minimum inhibitory concentration of a larger number of urinary bacterial isolates.
TI  - Chemotactic activity of L-forms and mycoplasma.
AB  - L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis showed  significantly less chemotactic activity for normal human leucocytes than did parent bacterial forms which were strongly chemotactic. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma hominis did not demonstrate chemotactic activity.

TI  - Lipids of antibiotic-resistant and -susceptible members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Lipids of antibiotic-resistant and related -susceptible strains of the Enterobacteriaceae were extracted with chloroform-methanol and characterized by thin-layer chromatography, densitometry, and fatty acid analysis using gas chromatography. Quantitative differences which correlated with antibiotic resistance existed among the phospholipids and fatty acids. A relatively higher concentration of a ninhydrin-positive phospholipid concentration with a lower amount of phosphatidylethanolamine was observed in antibiotic-resistant strains of serratia marcescens. Bacterial strains which harbored R-factor 222 had a higher ratio of phosphatidylglycerol to diphosphatidylglycerol than their respective parent strains while those strains which were resistant to the polymyxins had a lower ratio of these phospholipids. Differences in the relative amounts of certain unsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acids were observed between susceptible and resistant strains. Such differences, however, were dependent upon a particular genus and species.
TI  - Influence of rec and pol genes on the maintenance of a Proteus plasmid (P-lac) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The maintenance requirements of a Proteus plasmid, P-lac, in Escherichia coli have been investigated. P-lac could not be inherited by recB and polA1 mutants, and it requires a functional recC gene for maintenance. P-lac replication was inhibited by chloramphenicol.
TI  - [Biological characteristics of Proteus strains isolated from water sources in the Azerbajiani SSR].
AB  - Biological characteristics of 102 Proteus strains isolated from the water bodies  is given. The strains studied were referred to Pr. mirabilis, more rarely to Pr. vulgaris; about half of the cultures deviated from these biological types by the signs of indol formation and maltose fermentation. Proteus of groups O3, O5, O13, O23, and O30 were revealed in studying the serological characteristics. All the cultures were polyresistant, nonbacteriocinogenic; most of them were sensitive to the wide colicine spectrum. One strain produced a cytopathogenic action on the tissue culture.
TI  - A polyvalent human gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: passive protection of mice against lethal infection.
AB  - As a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PG) were studied in acute infections in mice. PG was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of P. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of P. aeruginosa. PG was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. The active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the IgG type and undoubltedly is directed against the O-antigen. PG was was not protective against challenge with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against Serratia marcescens. In a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced P. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to P. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. The apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. It is postulated that the successful treatment of advanced P. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.
TI  - Comparative studies of RNA polymerase subunits from various bacteria.
AB  - The molecular structure of RNA polymerases from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella anatum,serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogens, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis were compared based on:i) inhibition of the enzyme activity by treatment with antibodies against E. coli RNA polymerase subunits;ii) analysis of antibody precipitates by sodium ododecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and iii) analysis of antibody precipitates by urea-isoelectrofocusing followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. All the bacterial RNA polymerases examined cross-react equally with anti-E. COLI HOLOPOLYMERASE BUT EXHIbit different extents of cross-reaction with antibodies against individual subunits. Except for B. subtilis RNA polymerase, the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the enzyme subunits are close to those of E. coli polymerase. However, minor difference were found at least within the resolution of the techniques employed:S. anatum polymerase has sigma subunit larger than E. coli sigma subunit; P. mirabilis enzyme has sigma subunit larger in size and more acidic in charge, and alpha subunit smaller and more basic than corresponding E. coli subunits. The electrophoretic map of B. subtilis enzyme subunits is completely different from that of E. coli enzyme.
TI  - Laboratory studies on mecillinam: activity alone and combined with cephradine.
AB  - Mecillinam (MC) was found to be inhibitory at low concentrations to a wide range  of Gram-negative bacteria; the sensitivity of such strains could be predicted by using a 10 microgram disk. Resistance to MC did not appear to be associated with beta-lactamase-mediated destruction of the antibiotic. Ampicillin-resistant strains tended to be less sensitive to MC. MC and cephradine acted synergistically against Proteus mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris, Prov. stuartii and Serratia marcescens, and the combination was additive against most Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Plantar ulcers with osteomyelitis underneath. A bacteriological study.
AB  - 39 consecutive cases of plantar ulcers with underlying chronic osteomyelitis admitted in the Sacred Heart Hospital during 1975/1976 were studied for the infecting organisms and their sensitivity to easily available antibiotics. Single organism was iasolated in only 10 cases, the infection in the rest being a mixed one. The commonest organisms were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Proteus mirabilis. In a few cases Pseudomonas and E-Coli were also isolated. Chloramphenicol was the most effective antibiotic in general and Streptomycin the least. 70% of the staphylococcus strains isolated were found to be resistant to Penicillin. Empirical use of antibiotics especially Penicillin and Streptomycin is hence deprecated.

TI  - Differential susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to mouse urine and to urea.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the antimicrobial properties of  mouse urine and of urea against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Nornal urine was found to inhibit the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis, whereas urine from diuresing animals permitted multiplication of these bacteria. Addition of urea to urine from diuresing animals restored its bactericidal effect on P. mirabilis but not on E. coli. This bactericidal effect on P. mirabilis was dependent on the additive action of high content of urea and high pH and was prevented by the addition of urease inhibitor.

TI  - Activation of complement by opportunist pathogens and chemotypes of Salmonella minnesota.
AB  - Washed cells of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella minnesota chemotypes (S, Rb, and Re) were tested for their ability to activate the alternative complement pathway (ACP). Parameters of ACP activation were (i) conversion of C3 in 10 mM ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N1-tetraacetic acid-treated human serum supplemented with 2.5 mM MgCl2, (ii) lysis of glutathione-treated human erythrocytes in the presence of human serum, and (iii) C3 to C9 consumption in C4-deficient guinea pig serum. With the exception of S. minnesota Re and S. aureus, all of the strains were highly active in the test systems when compared with inulin. S. minnesota Re and S. aureus initiated C3 conversion in untreated human serum, suggesting that these microorganisms were capable of activating complement by a mechanism other than the ACP. These results provide direct evidence for ACP activation by opportunist gram-negative bacilli and refute the hypothesis that the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide cell wall is responsible for ACP activation.
TI  - Studies on quinoline derivatives and related compounds. 5. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 1-alkoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of novel 1-alkoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids was synthesized and screened as antimicrobial agents. The most active compounds in vitro against gram-negative microorganisms and Staphylococcus aureus were 1,4-dihydro-1-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxy-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (22), 1,2,6,9-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-9-oxofuro[3,2-f]quinoline-8-carboxylic acid (30, and 2,3,6,9-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-3-methyl -2,9-dioxothiazolo [5,4-f]quinoline-8-carboxylic acid (34). These compounds had antigram-negative activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-ethyl derivatives 1, 2, and 4. Their serum levels and urinary recovery rates in rats, however, were significantly improved relative to the latter compounds (1,2, and 4).
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  - A novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.

AB  - We examined bacterial persistence and resistance in the vaginal and fecal flora of 28 women who received a total of 253 months of daily low-dosage prophylaxis with nitrofurantoin macrocystals (100 mg per day) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (40 and 200 mg respectively). During trimethoprim-sulfamehtoxazole prophylaxis, 8.5% of monthly vaginal and 27% of monthly fecal cultures grew Escherichia coli, as compared to 36 and 96%, respectively for nitrofurantoin macrocrystals. Esch. coli resistant to nitrofurantoin occurred in two of 95 fecal cultures during therapy, and Esch. coli resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 16 of 182 (8.8%) fecal cultures. In the 12 months before treatment, 92 episodes of recurrent urinary infection occurred, as compared to six during treatment (none occurred on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). These results confirm the value of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for high-risk patient with recurrent urinary infections. Prophylaxis with nitrofurantoin macrocrystals seems adequate for less severe problems of reinfection.
TI  - [Bacteriuria. Bacteriological diagnosis and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents].
AB  - In a brief introduction, methods for collecting urine and diagnosis criteria are  reviewed. Data relative to a study of about 10,000 samples of urine from patients admitted to various departments of the Milan Ca' Granda Hospital in 1975 are then reported. The frequencies of the various species of bacteria isolated in cases of bacteriuria are reported. Those occurring most frequently were Proteus (40.7%) of whose four species, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus rettgeri cover almost all cases, and Escherichia coli (26.1%). As for individual isolated microrganisms, the sensitivity to 13 chemotherapeutic agents was tested. E. coli, Klebsiella and Enterococcus demonstrated a high degree of sensitivity with respect to the majority of antibiotics considered.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Cefazaflur, a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - Cefazaflur was tested in vitro against 262 strains of bacteria. Inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined with two inoculum sizes of bacterial cells in Mueller-Hinton broth and nutrient broth. Agar dilution studies also were performed. When tested in agar, 5.0 mug or less of cefazaflur per ml inhibited almost all strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. The drug was less active against Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, and 7.5 mug of antibiotic per ml inhibited approximately two-thirds to one-fourth of the strains. A concentration of 50 mug of cefazaflur per ml was required for inhibition of the enterococci. There was negligible activity against Pseudomonas. The drug demonstrated less activity in broth than in agar, and a major inoculum effect was seen with some strains. For example, with a lower inoculum, 2.5 mug of cefazaflur per ml killed all strains of E. coli, whereas with the higher inoculum, 7.5 mug of cefazaflur per ml, inhibited 64% and killed only 8% of strains. The activity of the drug for some strains was greater in Mueller-Hinton broth; for others, it was greater in nutrient broth. There were considerable differences in the results of the broth and agar studies for some species when the same medium was employed. Because of differences in activity found with different media, inocula, and method of testing, an evaluation of the eventual usefulness of cefazaflur must await the results of in vivo studies.
TI  - Method for obtaining more-accurate covalently closed circular plasmid-to-chromosome ratios from bacterial lysates by dye-buoyant density centrifugation.
AB  - A method that gives high recovery of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from crude bacterial lysates using ethidium bromide-cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation is presented. After Pronase digestion and shearing of the lysate, essentially 100% recovery of chromosomal DNA and a reproducible recovery of covalently closed circular (CCC) plasmid DNA is obtained for a specific plasmid in a given strain. This method should be useful for comparing the CCC plasmid/chromosome ratio of various plasmid-host combinations.

TI  - Effects of varying concentrations of novobiocin incorporated into two salmonella  plating media on the recovery of four enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide-producing strains of salmonellae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter  freundii, and Proteus mirabilis were isolated from fresh pork sausage. All the strains produced black-centered colonies on Hektoen enteric agar (HE). On xylose lysine deoxycholate agar (XLD), C. freundii produced yellow colonies, and the strains of the other three genera formed black-centered colonies. The selectivity of HE and XLD for salmonellae was improved by the addition of novobiocin to both media. With increasing concentrations of novobiocin, the degree of growth inhibition for the four genera was less on HE than on XLD. Novobiocin concentrations of 80 mug/ml in HE and 5 mug/ml in XLD did not affect the growth or colonial morphology of salmonellae. When 80 mug of novobiocin per ml was incorporated into HE, P. mirabilis strains were not recovered, 40% of C. freundii strains failed to form black-centered colonies, and growth of E. coli strains was not affected but colonies were altered without eliminating the black centers. When novobiocin at 5 mug/ml was incorporated into XLD, colonies of P. mirabilis strains were not recovered, C. freundii formed yellow colonies, and the colonies of the H(2)S-producing E. coli strains were unaffected.
TI  - Intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - Endocarditis due to enteric bacilli other than Salmonellae: case reports and literature review.
AB  - The clinical and pathological findings in two recent patients with non-salmonella enterobacterial endocarditis are described, and those of 42 patients in the literature are summarized. Most of the patients acquired their endocarditis secondary to urinary tract infection and had an acute clinical course characterized by high fever and chills. Thirty-two of these patients died, and all except one had a postmortem examination. The most frequent pathological finding was the occurrence of very large vegetations which caused relatively little destruction of the underlying valve. Prompt diagnosis and antibiotic therapy chosen on the basis of bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic activity against the individual bacterium may improve the prognosis in this disease. Results of tricuspid and pulmonic valvulectomies for bacteriologic failure in pseudomonas and in a few cases of enterobacterial endocarditis appear to warrant a surgical approach in patients with right-sided enterobacterial endocarditis who fail to respond to vigorous medical therapy.
TI  - Conservation of transfer ribonucleic acid and 5S ribonucleic acid cistrons in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The genes for tranfer ribonucleic acid (tDNA) and 5S ribonucleic acid (5SDNA) were isolated from the total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Escherichia coli. The relatedness of tDNA and 5S from E. coli and other species of Enterobacteriaceae was determined by reassociation of the isolated genes labeled with 32PO4 to unlabeled, unfractionated DNA. Double-stranded DNA was separated from unreacted DNA by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Thermal elution profiles were done to determine the amount of unpaired bases present in related DNA sequences. Relative to total DNA, both 5S DNA and tDNA were highly conserved throughout the Enterobacteriaceae, including the genera Yersinia and Proteus.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  - Inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the WHO-ICS agar dilution technique. Cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, Haemophilus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. Cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. None of these cephalosporins was active against Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteeae, Pseudomonas, or Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in urinary tract infections: a correlation of urinary bactericidal  activity with clinical efficacy.
AB  
TI  - Comparison of the effects of mecillinam and 6-aminopenicillanic acid on Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Single strains of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus  were grown on filter membranes placed on agar containing concentration series of mecillinam (FL 1060), 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), or ampicillin. P. mirabilis and E. coli were also exposed to combinations of mecillinam or 6-APA with ampicillin. Colony-forming units were counted, and cells were examined by interference phase-contrast and transmission electron microscopy. Mecillinam and 6-APA were very effective in reducing the viability of the two gram-negative species, but they were less effective against S. aureus. Combinations of mecillinam and 6-APA with ampicillin acted synergistically against the gram-negative bacilli. When the antibiotics were presented consecutively, their effects on viability were usually no greater than the effects of the individual antibiotics acting alone. When P. mirabilis and E. coli were exposed to mecillinam alone or in combination with ampicillin, the cells became rounded. 6-APA alone or in combination with ampicillin produced elongated polymorphic cells in these species. The most unusual morphological effects were ultrastructural. Mecillinam and, to a lesser extent, 6-APA produced inward growth of numerous pairs of trilamellar membranous structures within the cells. It is possible that these membranes represent the growth initiation of aberrant cross walls. Both mecillinam and 6-APA produced multiple, thick cross walls in S. aureus.
TI  - Expression and stability of Escherichia coli F-prime factors in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The expression and stability of Escherichia coli F-primes in Proteus mirabilis is examined. It is possible to consecutively introduce, and stably maintain, the DNA of several E. coli F-primes in P. mirabilis in the absence of selective pressure for all or some of the plasmids. Additionally, we can recover more than one F-prime from certain P. mirabilis recipient strains which carry DNA derived from several independent matings with E. coli F-prime donors.
TI  - Drug resistance in relation to use of silver sulphadiazine cream in a burns unit.
AB  - Topical chemoprophylaxis of extensive burns with silver sulphadiazine cream led to a large increase in the proportion of sulphadiazine-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in a burns unit. When all sulphonamide treatment in the ward was stopped; the incidence of sulphonamide-resistant strains fell back to levels similar to those recorded when silver sulphadiazine treatment was introduced. This was associated with a large reduction in the incidence of resistance of certain Gram-negative bacilli (especially Klebstella sp) to several antibiotics. Transferable resistance to sulphadiazine, shown by conjugation experiments with Escherichia coli K12, was found in a majority of the strains of Klebsiella sp tested, and in other species. A pattern of transferable resistance to tetracycline, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and sulphadiazine (T Ce Cl A Ca S) was found in four of the 22 strains of Klebsiella tested, and closely related patterns were transferred by five other strains. These patterns of resistance were commonly found in Klebsiella sp isolated from burns in the period before the withdrawal of sulphonamides from the ward but were found in none of the Klebsiella strains isolated in the first six months after that period. Strains of Acinetobacter and Proteus, in which transferable resistance was not found, showed no appreciable fall or rise in sulphadiazine resistance; there was no fall in resistance of these organisms to tetracycline, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, ampicillin or carbenicillin on withdrawal of sulphonamides from the ward, but there were substantial falls in resistance of Acinetobacter to kanamycin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline which were probably not caused by the withdrawal of sulphonamides.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of FR10024 a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  - FR10024 is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The in vitro antibacterial activity of FR10024 against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis is greater than that of any of the cephalosporins developed to date. Indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter are resistant to FR10024, as is true for the other cephalosporins. However, more than half of the strains of Enterobacter and Citrobacter tested were susceptible to FR10024 at an inoculum of 10(6) cells/ml. A single subcutaneous injection of FR10024 to mice with peritoneal infections due to S. aureus and several species of gram-negative bacilli gave a protective effect inferior to that of cefazolin but appeared to be superior to that of cephalothin. When given in two divided doses, however, the protective effect of FR10024 was enhanced and almost equaled that of cefazolin. The serum levels and rates of urinary recovery of FR10024 varied in different animal species. The mean peak serum level of FR10024 in humans after a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg was two times higher than that of cephalothin. The serum half-life after intramuscular injections of 250 and 500 mg was slightly shorter than that of cephalothin. After receiving 250 mg of FR10024 intramuscularly the urinary recovery rate was 87.7% in healthy volunteers. The biliary excretion rate of FR10024 was particularly high. The 24-h excretion of FR10024 in rats was 63.3%, this being six to seven times higher than that for cefazolin, which has the highest biliary excretion of the other known cephalosporins. When FR10024 was injected intramuscularly (20 mg/kg), it was found that the hepatic levels of FR10024 in rats were the highest of all the cephalosporins, including cefazolin, but the levels of FR10024 in other tissues were not as high as those of cefazolin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of netilmicin and comparison with sisomicin, gentamicin, and tobramycin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of netilmicin, a new semisynthetic aminoglycosidic aminocyclitol, was determined against 123 recent gram-negative clinical isolates susceptible to gentamicin and 60 isolates resistant to either sisomicin, gentamicin, or tobramycin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of netilmicin, sisomicin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, and indole-positive Proteus were, in general, quite similar. Gentamicin was the most active against Serratia. A total of 54, 67, and 88% of gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Klebsiella, respectively, were susceptible to netilmicin. Strains of indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Providencia, and E. coli resistant to gentamicin were likely to be resistant also to netilmicin.
TI  - [Studies on the activation of humoral defense factors against bacteria in larvae  of the wax moth Galleria mellonella L].
AB  - The change of lysozyme activity in the hemolymph of the wax moth larvae caused by vaccination is influenced by the size and the dose of the injected particles. The rate of incorporation of those particles into phagocytes has no effect on this process. The change of lysozyme activity correlats negatively with the amount of granulocytes after vaccination. There were no correlations with the amount of other types of the hemocytes, neither with the resistance of the larvae against Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor with the survival of gram-negative bacteria within the hemocoelom. Origin, regulation and role of lysozyme are discussed regarding the defence against gram-negative bacteria. In the hemolymph of wax moth larvae after vaccination the formation of spheroblasts has been observed with all gram-negative strains of bacteria studied. The speed and extent of the formation of spheroblasts corresponded to the pathogenicity of these bacteria for the larvae as well as to the survival of the bacteria within the hemocoelom.
TI  - Sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria to six aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - An in vitro study of the susceptibility of 201 newly isolated strains of gramnegative bacteria to six aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and netilmicin) was performed by the twofold dilution method in fluid medium. Both the minimal inhibitory concentration and the minimal bacteridical concentration were determined. Overall, tobramycin seemed the most effective of the drugs studied. Netilmicin, the new derivative from sisomicin, compared favourably with the other drugs tested, but may, on theoretical grounds, offer the additional advantage of retained efficacy in the face of developing bacterial resistance. Not unexpectedly, amikacin appeared to be the most promising of the drugs studied in its action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin and netilmicin appeared to be the most effective of this group of antibiotics against Klebsiella species.
TI  - In vitro activity of netilmicin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of netilmicin (Sch 20569), a new semisynthetic derivative of gentamicin, was compared with that of gentamicin and amikacin. One hundred and ninety-two clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested using both agar and broth dilution techniques. Netilmicin was comparable to gentamicin, with the following exceptions: (i) for Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa, gentamicin was more active than netilmicin; (ii) all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin; (iii) some strains of S. marcescens, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin. Netilmicin was more active than amikacin for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus and equal to amikacin in activity against gentamicin-susceptible strains of P. aeruginosa. All strains of P. aeruginosa, resistant to gentamicin, were also resistant to netilmicin but were susceptible to amikacin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained with broth and agar showed no significant differences except for P. mirabilis, where broth MICs were twofold greater than agar MICs, and for P. aeruginosa, where agar MICs were twofold higher than broth MICs. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was either identical to or within one twofold dilution of the MIC for the strains tested. A 100-fold increase in inoculum size produced less increase in MIC and MBC with netilmicin than with gentamicin or amikacin.
TI  - Fosfomycin, antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of fosfomycin were investigated both in vitro and in vivo for the purpose of comparative evaluation on its fundamental properties with other antimicrobial agents. The MIC was determined with nutrient agar (Difco) inoculated with one loopful of 1,000-fold dilution (about 10(6) cells/ml) of bacterial suspension cultured overnight in nutrient broth. This substance showed antibacterial activity to most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, being strongest to Enterobacteriaceae with a peak of the MIC at 1.56 mug/ml in Salmonella. It was also active against P. aeruginosa with a peak of the MIC at 6.25 mug/ml in its sensitivity distribution. Intravenous and subcutaneous fosfomycin Na salt and oral fosfomycin Ca salt were given to 5-week-old ddN strain male mice challenged with clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, E. coli and P. mirabilis. Therapeutic effect was observed in all these test organisms. In P. aeruginosa, it was more effective than carbenicillin.
TI  - R plasmids coding for gentamicin, tobramycin, and carbenicillin resistance in Serratia, Klebsiella and Escherichia coli strains from a single clinical source.
AB  - Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli strains bearing transferable resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, namely, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lividomycin, and carbenicillin, as well as to a series of more classical drugs, began to emerge in materials from the Frankfurt University Hospital. Plasmids from Serratia, Klebsiella, and E. coli exhibit a broad host range in that they are transferable to E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium receipients. They are not transferable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although in that species plasmids of gentamicin and tobramycin resistance, was well as of resistance to further drugs, were detected in that area as early as in 1973. High-level carbenicillinase has been identified in Serratia and Klebsiella plasmids associated with drug resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.

TI  - An experimental study on the pathogenesis of sporadic bacteriuria in the rat.
AB  - An experimental model is used in which one ureter of a rat is ligated with the object of forming a hydronephrosis from which urine specimens can subsequently be collected. Ascending urinary infection from the bladder is excluded by the ligation. The investigations with this experimental model showed that growth of intestinal bacteria occasionally occurred in culture of urine obtained from the occluded renal pelvis. Ascending infection being excluded, these bacteria had in all probability entered the renal pelvis via the hydronephrotic kidney. The frequency of infection seemed to increase with age. Whedronephrotic kidney. The frequency of infection seemed to increase with age. When intravenous injection of E. coli was added to the standard experiment, substantial growth of these bacteria was found in the left upper urinary tract in 16 out of 17 animals thus treated.
TI  - [Demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria in the urine of pregnant women].
AB  - Urinary sediments of 64 pregnant women with significant bacteriuria which has been demonstrated several times before, have been investigated for the presence of antibody coated bacteria. Antibody titers were determined in the corresponding serum samples in addition and the results were compared with the clinical diagnosis. In 50% of pregnant women with pyelonephritis antibody coated bacteria could be demonstrated, while 60% of them had elevated serum titers. Taking into account both results in 80% of the pregnant women the clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis could be confirmed. Pregnant women with asymptomatically significant bacteriuria never gave positive results, whereas pregnant women with cystitis mainly did have negative results. The demonstration of antibody coated bacteria in the urinary sediments of pregnant women with significant bacteriuria as well as the detection of elevated serum antibody titers with the indirect immunofluorescence technique against the urinary strain were found to be of importance for the valuation of a significant bacteriuria.
TI  - Oxolinic acid therapy for urinary tract infections in children.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized children with Gram-negative bacillary urinary tract infections were treated with oxolinic acid for 14 to 21 dyas. Fifteen of 17 patients with uncomplicated and 11 of 13 with complicated urinary infections had favorable bacteriologic responses. Resistant organisms developed in four treatment failures. Oxolinic acid urine concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentration for most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris, P morganii, and P rettgeri. Approximately half of these patients experienced mild symptoms possibly related to oxolinic acid therapy; in no instance did they require cessation of therapy. Our experience indicates that if the urine is not sterile by the end of five days of treatment, bacterial resistance to oxolinic acid is likely to have developed, and therapy with another agent should be considered and antibiotic susceptibility tests repeated.
TI  - Significant bacteriuria among the mentally retarded. Identification and antibiotic sensitivity of isolates.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of significant bacteriuria in a mentally retarded population. With 100,000 or more bacteria per ml. of urine used as a criterion for significant bacteriuria, 24 of 665 persons studied were considered to have significant bacteriuria for an overall prevalence rate of 3.6%. Seventeen of the 24 positive urine cultures were either from clean catch or catheter specimens. All patients undergoing catheterization were found to have significant bacteriuria. The individual prevalence rates of significant bacteriuria for males and females were 1.7 and 5.6 respectively. In females, an increasing prevalence of bacteriuria was found primarily in the 55-64 age group. The predominant bacteria isolated from bacteriuric patients were gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, being isolated in 50% of all positive cultures. Antiobiotic sensitivity patterns of the isolates indicated a high degree of in vitro resistance to both ampicillin and cephalothin.
TI  - Treatment of cefazolin in 45 cases of urinary tract infections.
AB  - We have treated 45 cases of urinary tract infection with cefazolin (i.m.) and cure was achieved in 35 (77.77%). 26 of the 28 patients (92.85%) with acute cystitis who received 250 mg every 12 h for 6-10 days were cured. 17 patients with pyelonephritis received 500 mg every 12 h during 10-14 days and therapeutical success was achieved in 9 of them (52.94%). Laboratory control was carried out at the initiation of therapy, at the end, and 1 month after therapy. Tolerance to injections of cefazolin was considered good and only in one case appeared a mild eosinophia.
TI  - Alteration of effectiveness of antibiotics by anaerobiosis.
AB  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests of facultative organisms are routinely performed under aerobic conditions, despite the fact that many infections caused by these organisms occur in anaerobic areas, i.e., intra-abdominal absess. Experiments were performed aerobically and anaerobically to determine the susceptibility of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and K. pneumoniae to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cefamandole. Antibiotic sensitivities were determined by disc and agar dilution techniques in air and in anaerobic jars with CO2 absorbed. Tube dilution studies were performed in air and anaerobically and time-kill studies were done in aerobic and anaerobic broth. The amount of aminoglycoside required to inhibit bacterial growth was increased 4 to 20 times by anaerobiosis in 20 of 25 strains tested. Time-kill curves showed that bacterial killing by aminoglycosides was markedly impaired by anaerobiosis. Anaerobic conditions had no effect on the rate or extent of killing by cephalosporins. These data may have significance in determination of antibiotic susceptibility of facultative organisms under anaerobic tissue conditions. Antibiotic sensitivity testing done on these organisms in air may not reflect the actual state of antibiotic-bacterial interaction under conditions of the infection.
TI  - The comparative efficacy of cephalexin and sulfisoxazole in acute urinary tract infection in children.
AB  - A double blind, comparative study of the efficacy of cephalexin versus sulfisoxazole was conducted on 100 children with initial episodes of urinary tract infections. The overall bacteriologic and clinical cure rates were comparable for both antimicrobials. Children treated with cephalexin had a clinical cure rate of 86 per cent and a bacterial cure rate of 84 per cent, while those given sulfisoxazole were found to have rates of 82 and 92 per cent respectively. However, cephalexin was noted to have a rather high rate of failure in the therapy of Proteus micrabilis infections (4/8), casting some doubt on its use in urinary infections caused by the organism. Untoward effects associated with either medication were minimal.

TI  - Diploidy for a structural gene specifying a major protein of the outer cell envelope membrane from Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Homogenotes, heterogenotes, and intergeneric hybrids have been studied that are diploid for the structural gene of a major outer cell envelope membrane protein (protein II) from Escherichia coli. This protein can act as a phage receptor. In wild-type homogenotes, diploidy for the gene did not cause a gene dosage effect. It could be shown with two heterogenotes that both the chromosomal mutant and the episomal wild-type genes are expressed, and in each case more of the mutant than the wild-type protein species was found in the cell envelope. In on case of 21 phage-resistant mutants missing protein II was a trans effect observed of the mutant gene on the expression of the episomal wild type gene. Transfer of E. coli episomes carrying the protein II structural gene into Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis resulted in intergeneric hybrids that became sensitive to the relevant phage and harbored the E. coli protein II in their cell envelopes. The results may be taken as suggestive evidence for a simple feedback mechanism for the regulation of synthesis of protein II, and they show that there are no highly specific requirements on protein primary structure for incorporation into an outer cell envelope membrane.
TI  - Control of replication and segregation of R plasmid Rts1.
AB  - A mutant plasmid, pTW2, which was derived from the integrated Rst1 genome in the  Escherichia coli chromosome, was studied as to its mode of replication at 30 degrees C. When Proteus mirabilis Pm17 harboring pTW2 was grown in broth at 30 degrees C, a considerable number of R- segregants (approximately 40%) were consistently observed. This indicates that pTW2 is unstable even at the permissive temperature for the replication of Rts1. The pTW2+ cells in a culture were heterogeneous with respect to the level of kanamycin resistance, ranging from 500 to 4,000 mug of the drug per ml. The amount of pTW2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) relative to the Pm17 chromosomal DNA was about fivefold as large as that of Rts1 DNA in an exponentially growing culture. In addition, pTW2 in P. mirabilis continued to replicate after the chromosome had ceased to replicate, which was shown in the study of the inhibition of protein synthesis. Contrary to pTW2, the parent plasmid Rts1 is highly stable, and the relative percent Rts1 DNA is maintained at approximately 7% in any cultural conditions at a permissive temperature. These results suggest that copies of pTW2 may not segregate evenly into the host progeny upon cell division and that the replication of pTW2 does not coordinate with that of the chromosome. A remarkable instability of pTW2 as well as an increase in the relative percent pTW2 DNA was also shown when E. coli were used as the host cells. These results suggest the possibility that there is a gene or a gene cluster on the Rst1 genome responsible for the control of both replication and segregation of Rts1.
TI  - Tobramycin, amikacin, sissomicin, and gentamicin resistant Gram-negative rods.
AB  - Sensitivities to gentamicin, sissomicin, tobramycin, and amikacin were compared in 196 gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative rods and in 212 similar organisms sensitive to gentamicin, mainly isolated from clinical specimens. Amikacin was the aminoglycoside most active against gentamicin-resistant organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Proteus spp, Providencia spp, and Citrobacter spp being particularly susceptible. Most of the gentamicin-resistant organisms were isolated from the urine of patients undergoing surgery. Gentamicin was the most active antibiotic against gentamicin-sensitive E coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp were most susceptible to tobramycin.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefoxitin, a new cephalosporin (author's transl)].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of Cefoxitin (CEX), Cefazolin (CEZ) and Cephalothin (CEF) against E. coli (n = 380), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =108) and Staph. aureus (n = 47) were determined by the agar diffusion method. For Proteus mirabilis (n = 69) and indole-positive Proteus species (n = 23), the tube dilution test was used. CEF was the most active against Staph. aureus while CEZ showed greater activity against E. coli. CEX was the most active against Kl. pneumoniae and Proteus species. In particular, CEX was also active against pathogens resistant to CEF or CEZ. The good bactericidal effect of CEX was demonstrated by membrane filtration methods.

TI  - Experimental pyelonephritis in the monkey. IV. Vesicoureteral reflux and bacteria.
AB  - A model was designed to study the relation between urinary infection and vesicoureteral, low-grade, total reflux. Surgical alteration of the ureterovesical junction produced grade 2 vesicoureteral reflux in seven of 13 animals. In the other six animals, surgery had rendered the vesicoureteral junction marginally competent and chronic bladder infection caused grade 2 reflux. It was found that grade 2 vesicoureteral reflux in the adult monkey neither prolongs urinary tract infection nor causes continued renal infection.
TI  - Protection against Gram-negative infection by 'super-active' antigen.
AB  - 'Super-active' antigens modified antigens released from bacteria which had been phagocytosed and killed by human leucocytes, were found to induce protective responses in mice within 24 h of immunization. At the earliest time (24 h) when immunized mice were protected against lethal intrapertoneal (i.p.) challenge by the bacteria from which which the 'super-active' antigens were made (Proteus mirabilis) the leucocytes of peripheral blood from immunized mice showed enhanced phagocytosis and killing of autologous bacteria and there was an increase in the number of lymphocytes producing anti-proteus antibody. Another mouse protective factor inducing transient protection lasting 1-2 days against lethal i.p. challenge by P. mirabilis was found in preparations of lysed heman leucocytes not engaged in phagocytosis. Burned mice, immunized with 'super-active' antigen preparations were protected against lethal invasive proteus infection, inoculated on to the burn surface, 2 h after burning and immunization.

TI  - Human oral defenses against gram-negative rods.
AB  - Gram-negative rods are unusual pharyngeal isolates in normal man, which suggests  the presence of effective oral defense mechanisms against these organisms. To understand this protection better, we studied the elimination of gram-negative rods from the mouth after gargle challenge. Suspensions of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis (108 organisms per ml) were gargled by normal volunteers, and pharyngeal swabs for serial quantitative cultures were taken for 3 hours. Initial swabs yielded approximately 10(5) organisms. Bacterial counts rapidly decreased, and less than 1 per cent of the original inoculum was still recoverable 3 hours later. Studies of tongue, pharynx, and buccal mucosa samples showed the most rapid decrease in buccal mucosa samples and the slowest decrease in tongue swabs. To evaluate physical clearance, gargle challenges were performed using E. coli radiolabeled with technetium-99m. External counts of the oral cavity decreased rapidly, with 21.8, 14.7, 8.9, and 7.8 percent of the initial counts remaining at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively. Nonpiliated E. coli adhered poorly to buccal epithelial cells in vitro, in contrast to good adherence when piliated strains were tested. Despite these findings, no differences in radiolabel clearance was noted in vivo using piliated and nonpiliated E. coli for gargle challenges. Normal oral defenses against gram-negative rods are highly effective and seem to involve both physical clearance and local bactericidal activity.
TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of nine cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of nine cephalosporins (cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefatrizine, cefoxitin, and cefazaflur) was determined against 344 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 99 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. Cefamandole, cefazaflur, and cefuroxime were the most active cephalosporins against the Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Serratia marcescens). However, cefoxitin was the only cephalosporin that inhibited all 30 S. marcescens strains in a concentration of 16 mug/ml and was by far the most active compound against selected cephalothin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited best by cefuroxime, but none of the cephalosporins had appreciable activity against the Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - The aerobic bacterial flora of the anal sac of the red fox.
AB  
TI  - Effect of cephalothin on growth patterns of micro-organisms.
AB  - Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were incubated in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin. After destruction of the antibiotic, there was a lag phase before S. aureus began to proliferate again. When similar experiments were conducted with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, no lag phase was observed. This data suggests that the inhibitory activity of cephalosporins may be different for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (Dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  - Normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (Dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. Serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. Streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. Gaffkya tetragena and Bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, Proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and Proteus mirabilis and Micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. Infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and Toolan's H-1 viruses, and Theiler's GDVII antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. Hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. Serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for GDVII virus in all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for Sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. Only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. The endoparasites found in these agoutis were Ascaris, Toxascaris, Strongyloides, Trichuris, and Trichomonas.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Properties of plasmids constructed by the in vitro insertion of DNA from Rhizobium leguminosarum or Proteus mirabilis into RP4.
AB  - Plasmids have been constructed by insertion of DNA from Rhizobium leguminosarum or Proteus mirabilis into RP4 (an R factor of group P). Such recombinant plasmids retain the wide host range of the parental plasmid, being as efficiently transmissible as the unmodified RP4 and are stably maintained in rapidly growing cultures. The recombinant plasmids, even though each contained a DNA sequence absolutely identical with that of the host strain, are no more efficient at mobilizing the transfer of chromosomal genetic information from that host strain than was unmodified RP4. We therefore conclude that an unknown factor must be essential in the process of chromosome mobilization and rate limiting for that process.
TI  - A study of skin diseases in dogs and cats. II. Microflora of the normal skin of dogs and cats.
AB  - A study of the microflora of the normal skin was undertaken in 10 dogs and 10 cats. Swabs were taken from the surface of the skin at 7 different sites (Fig. 1). Micrococcus spp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Acinetobacter spp. were found consistently in both species. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 9 dogs and 4 cats, and staphylococcus epidermidis from 7 dogs and 5 cats. Beta-hemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas spp., and Alcaligenes spp. were found sporadically.
TI  - The prevalence of ampicillin, cephalosporin and sulphonamide resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - A total of 2,031 clinical isolates of Gram negative bacilli was obtained from hospitals in 4 centres and these cultures were tested for resistance to ampicillin, cephazolin and sulphonamide. Ampicillin and sulphonamide resistance in outpatients ranged from 15 to 28 per cent of E. coli strains and 4 to 11 per cent of Proteus mirabilis strains. Resistance to cephazolin in outpatients ranged from 0 to 3 per cent of E. coli and 0 to 6 per cent of Proteus mirabilis. Resistance patterns for E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella strains isolated from inpatients were much higher and varied widely. These patterns are presented and the reasons for these variations discussed.
TI  - Transcription of Escherichia coli ribosomal DNA in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Transcription of Escherichia coli ribosomal DNA introduced into Proteus mirabilis on F14 is described. We have developed an assay for E. coli coded ribosomal RNA involving fingerprinting of ribonuclease T1 digests of RNA isolated from ribosomal subunits. Sequence differences in the ribosomal RNA of the two species have allowed us to detect E. coli coded 16S, 23S, and 5S ribosomal RNA in ribosomal subunits of the E. coli-P. mirabilis hybrid. The proportion of E. coli coded rRNA in the hybrid is found at a level which is compatible with the number of E. coli (and P. mirabilis) ribosomal DNA sequences. The resulting ribosomal RNA appears in ribosomes in a form which indicates extensive compatibility of E. coli coded ribosomal RNA with P. mirabilis ribosomal proteins and maturational factors.
TI  - Comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol. The mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Tobramycin and cephalothin for treatment of suspected sepsis in neutropenic children with cancer.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of tobramycin and cephalothin in treatment of suspected sepsis were studied in neutropenic children with various malignancies. Twenty episodes of suspected sepsis in 19 febrile children with cancer were treated with parenteral tobramycin and cephalothin; the duration of therapy ranged from one to 80 days. In 14 of the 20 episodes of suspected sepsis, a favorable clinical response was achieved within five days after initiation of antibiotic therapy. These episodes included a urinary tract infection with Proteus mirabilis and sepsis due to Escherichia coli. In four of the additional six episodes, clinical deterioration was though to be caused by the underlying malignancies. Two episodes included a case of E. coli spesis that ended fatally and a nosocomial infection with Eikenella corrodens. Results of this study suggest that combination therapy with tobramycin and cephalothin is safe and efficacious in treatment of suspected sepsis in febrile children with malignancies and neutropenia.
TI  - Susceptibility of "enterobacteria" to penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycins, erythromycin, and rifampin.
AB  - Agar dilution tests for susceptibility of gram-negative rods and enterococci were done with a number of penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycin analogues, erythromycin, and rifampin. Many in the first three categories were investigational drugs. All were generally less active than aminoglycoside and tetracycline antibiotics against gram-negative rods and more active against enterococci. Cephalosporins as a group were more active than penicillins against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and less active enterococci. Both groups were equally active against Enterobacter, Proteus, and Providencia but inactive against most strains of Serratia and all strains of Pseudomonas; however, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and BL-1654 were active against most strains of Pseudomonas. Penicillins and cephalosporins were more active against Proteus mirabilis than against indole-positive Proteus. Lincomycins had little or no activity against gram-negative rods but were moderately active against enterococci. Erythromycin was more active than the lincomycins, but rifampin was much more active than either of these types of drug. Of the penicillins, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and BL-P1654 were the most active against gram-negative rods, whereas BL-P1654, amoxicillin, and ampicillin were the most active against enterococci. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cyclacillin, and penicillin V were essentially inactive against gram-negative rods. Of the cephalosporins tested, cephanone and cefamandole were the most active against most gram-negative rods, whereas cephaloridine and cephacetrile were the most active against enterococci. The least active of the cephalosporins against most species were cephradine, cephalexin, and cephapirin, but cefoxitin was the least active against enterococci.
TI  - [Comparative studies with the rapid KCN-test for Enterobacteriaceae according to  Cahan, Sechter and Ohad (author's transl)].
AB  - 581 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (184 of Salmonella, 100 of Shigella, 31 of Citrobacter freundii, 61 of Escherichia coli, 40 of Klebsiella, 165 of Proteus) were investigated in comparison with the KCN-test according to Moller and with the rapid KCN-test according to Cahan, Sechter and Ohad. There was found that the results obtained with both methods were identical to 99 percent. In both tests there could be observed that inexplicable differences occur only in two strains of Proteus mirabilis. The rapid KCN-test can be recommended because of the good durability of the basic medium and of the solutions of the reagents, because of the short testing time (3 h), of the very good correspondence of the results and of the possibility of a well defined reading.
TI  - Formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, and C. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Edwardsiella tarda and Escherichia coli formed calcite III crystals, whereas Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation process of kidney stone formation.
TI  - Sensitivity patterns of urinary pathogens in the Southland community and a study  of sewage flora.
AB  - The overall sensitivity pattern of the three main urinary pathogens to the commonly used oral antibodies exceeded 80 percent. The incidence of multiple resistant Escherichia coli was 8 percent. The resistant patterns of the sewage E. coli resembled that of the resistant urinary E. coli. However only one-third of the resistant urinary E. coli showed multiple resistance whereas two-thirds of the resistant E. coli in the sewage showed this feature. The resistance transfer was low in organisms isolated from the sewage. Regular surveillance of this type may be useful as a guide to therapy and may reflect the impact of continued antibiotic usage in the community.
TI  - Purification and properties of the alpha2beta2 complex of tryptophan synthetase of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A procedure is described for the purification of the tryptophan synthetase alpha2beta2 complex from cell extracts of Proteus mirabilis. A 30-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of about 23% and a specific activity of 1,600. The complex can be dissociated and the subunits isolated in a pure form. The complex can be reconstituted from the isolated subunits to regain the initial activity. The alpha and beta2 subunits of the tryptophan synthetase complex of P. mirabilis are not significantly different from those of Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria as to their physical properties, amino acid compositions, and enzymic properties. Complementation studies indicate that the alpha subunit of P. mirabilis hybridizes well with the beta2 subunit from E. coli. Similarly, the beta2 subunit of P. mirabilis readily complexes with the alpha subunits from E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens. The hybrids formed are all effective in catalyzing the conversion of indoleglycerol phosphate plus serine into tryptophan and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. However, these hybrids have reduced or no activity in the other reactions, namely, the condensation of indole and serine to form tryptophan or the aldolytic cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate.
TI  - In vitro activity of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in combination against  bacteria associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. Gentamicin inhibited all strains of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to 3.1 mug/ml and all strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. Whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the Enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with E. coli (60%). Minocycline inhibited 62% of Bacteroides fragilis, 71% of Clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. Whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of B. fragilis, 67% of Clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. Although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of E. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. Antagonism between gentamicin and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.
TI  - EcoRI restriction endonuclease map of the composite R plasmid NR1.
AB  - A physical map of the composite R plasmid NR1 has been constructed using specific cleavage of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the restriction endonuclease EcoR-. Digestion of composite NR1 DNA by EcoRI yields thirteen fragments. The six largest fragments (designated A to F) are from the resistance transfer factor component that harbors the tetracycline resistance genes (RTF-TC). The seven smallest fragments (designated G to M) are from the r-determinants component that harbors the chloramphenicol (CM), streptomycin-spectinomycin (SM/SP), and sulfonamide (SA) resistance genes. The largest fragment of several RTF-TC segregants of NR1 that have deleted the r-determinants component is 0.8 X 10(6) daltons larger than fragment A of composite NR1. Only a part of fragment H of the r-determinants component is amplified in transitioned NR1 DNA in Proteus mirabilis, which consists of multiple, tandem sequences of r-determinants attached to a single copy of the RTF-TC component. Both of these changes can be explained by the locations of the excision sites at the RTF-TC: r-determinants junctions that are involved in the dissociation and reassociation of the RTF-TC and r-determinants components. The thirteen fragments of composite NR1 DNA produced by EcoRI have been ordered using partial digestion techniques. The order of the fragments is: A-D-C-E-F-B-H-I-L-K-G-M-J. The approximate locations of the TC, CM, SM/SP, and SA resistance genes on the EcoRI map were determined by analyzing several deletion mutants of NR1.
TI  - [Intracellular nucleodepolymerase of bacteria, representatives of the Proteus and Providencia groups. Its isolation and properties].
AB  - High activity of enzymes, splitting native, denaturated DNA, deoxyribooligonucleotides and RNA, was observed in cell free extracts of bacteria--representatives of 5 strains of Proteus-Providencia. Some properties of nucleases were studied in cell free extracts. In the bacteria studied DNAases were thermolabile proteins, which were completely inactivated at 50-60 degrees, RNAases were more thermostable. The pH optima of the DNAases were at pH 9.0-11.0 in cell free system; RNAases were maximally active at pH 8.0-9.0
TI  - [Studies on the distribution of thienylcarbenicillin in the human tissue].
AB  - Thienylcarbenicillin is another semisynthetic penicillin with a wide range of antibacterial activity including most of gram-negative bacterias, even such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate penetration activities into bone and another tissues, 120 specimens of serum and 120 specimens of tissue were obtained from 20 patients, after i.v. injection of a single doses of 150 mg thienylcarbenicillin per kg body weight. The evaluation of concentration showed that Thienylcarbenicillin was eliminated from serum in a half-life time of 77 minutes. The concentration varied in different tissues. Maximal levels were found in musculature and in spongy bone. Unexpected high concentrations were found in fascia and in cutis. The lowest concentration was found in subcutis and compact bone. The experimental doses of 150 mg/kg body weight was not enough to gain a sufficient therapeutical level in compact bone.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  - Cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. Studies  were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. At obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. In agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive Proteus but not Enterobacter. Moreover, in broth medium most strains of Enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. However, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive Proteus. Cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of E. coli. These data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive Proteus species as well as some other Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, with the exception of strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and not in broth.
TI  - Imidazo(1,2-c)pyrimidine nucleosides. Synthesis and biological evaluation of certain 1-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo(1,2-c)pyrimidines.
AB  - The first chemical syntheses of the arabinosylhypoxanthine and arabinosylguanine  analogues of the imidazo-[1,2-c]pyrimsdine series are described. Condensation of trimethylsilyl-7-chloroimidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-one (1) with 2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-D-arabinofuranosyl chloride (2) gave 7-chloro-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-on e (3) which on catalytic dehalogenation furnished 1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-one (4). Amination of 3 gave 7-amino-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-o ne (5). Reductive hydrogenolysis of 4 and 5 gave 1-(betaD-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-one (6), the arabinosylhypoxantine analogue, and the corresponding 7-amino isomer 7, the arabinoosylguanine analogue, respectively. The unequivocal assignment of the site of glycosylation and the anomeric configuration have been established. None of the compounds exhibited significant antiviral or antimicrobial activity in vitro.
TI  - N-Nitrosamine formation by cultures of several microorganisms.
AB  - Of 38 pure cultures of microorganisms tested, only one, Pseudomonas stutzeri, was capable of forming dimethylnitrosamine from dimethylamine and nitrite during growth. Resting cells of P. stutzeri, Cryptococcus terreus, Escherichia coli, and Xanthomonas campestris formed dimethylnitrosamine, although no nitrosamine was found in growing cultures of the latter three organisms. No nitrosamine was produced by either growing cultures or resting-cell suspensions of Pseudomonas fragi or Proteus mirabilis. Boiled cells of P. stutzeri, but not those of C. terreus, E. coli, and X. campestris, formed dimethylnitrosamine, and this nitrosamine was also produced by extracts of E. coli cells at pH 5.0.
TI  - [Sensitivity of bacteria causing urinary tract infections towards terizidon (author's transl)].
AB  - In agar diffusion tests 2603 bacterial strains of species known to cause urinary  tract infections were tested routinely in regard to their sensitivity towards Terizidon, a derivative of cycloserine. In order to relate the results which were obtained in terms of the diameter of the inhibiton zone, to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 304 of these strains were tested additionally in agar dilution tests. The MICs of the other strains were estimated from the results of these tests. Since it is known that after the oral administration of 500 mg Terizidon the urine contains, on average, more than 128 mug/ml Terizidon for 12 hours and longer, it may be concluded from the results of this investigation that 75% of the strains of E. coli and Citrobacter, 45% of enterobacter, 40% of Proteus mirabilis and enterococci, 35% of the indole-positive Proteus strains and 30% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa would have been successfully attacked by Terizidon in the case or urinary tract infections. By contrast, Klebsiella must be reagarded as being completely resistant to this antibiotic. It follows that the administration of Terizidon is mainly indicated in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections with E. coli as the predominant causative agent.

TI  - Studies on the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Sixty-one amniotic fluid samples from women in their second and third trimesters  of pregnancy were examined for antimicrobial activity. Seventy per cent of the fluids were found to be active. The factor or factors responsible for this activity were present in low concentrations. The presence of spermine in the fluids accounted for some of the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  - The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: Phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, Rh. viridis, Rhodospirillum tenue, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Vibrio metchnikovii, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid L-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. With the aid of authentic D-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-O-substitution or type of linkage, possess the D-configuration. 2-Hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the L-configuration.
TI  - Tobramycin: in vitro and clinical evaluation in 30 patients.
AB  - Clinical evaluation of intramuscular tobramycin was accomplished in 30 patients with respiratory, soft tissue, urinary tract, bone or septicemic infections due to gram negative bacilli. Median sensitivity to tobramycin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (19 strains) was 0.62 mug/ml and range 0.31-2.5 mug/ml; less activity was observed for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species isolates but median minimum inhibitory concentrations were less than or equal to 2.5 mug/ml. Therapy resulted in clinical and bacteriologic cures in 16 patients (53 per cent) including 13 of 16 (181 per cent) with urinary tract infections; 9 of the 14 patients who did not obtain bacteriologic cure had satisfactory clinical responses. Tobramycin was effective for selected gram negative bacillary infections and particularly for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The importance of prolonged incubation for the synthesis of dimethylnitrosamine by enterobacteria.
AB  - Tests with 140 strains representing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri and P. morganii in a defined medium supplemented with 0-09M dimethylamine (DMA) and 0-1M potassium nitrate showed that at least 89% of the 136 strains able to reduce nitrates produced up to 9mM dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in 70h at 37 degrees C. Four nitratase-negative strains produced DMN from DMA in the presence of sodium nitrate. Prolonged incubation was the most important factor in determining DMN production. Stasis and persistent infection in the urinary tract, by simulating prolonged incubation of a culture, may be of importance in determining whether the potential carcinogen, DMN, could be produced in vivo by bacterial action on DMA and nitrate in urine.
TI  - Tryptophan operon regulation in interspecific hybrids of enteric bacteria.
AB  - We examined tryptophan regulation in merodiploid hybrids in which a plasmid carrying the trp operon of Escherichia was introduced into Trp mutants of other enteric genera, or in which a plasmid carrying the trpR+ (repressor) gene of E. coli was transfered into fully constitutive trpR mutants of other genera. In these hybrids the trp operon of one species is controlled by the repressor of a different species. Similar investigations were possible in transduction hybrids in which either the trp operon or the trpR+ locus of Shigella dysenteriae was introduced into E. coli. Our measurements of trp enzymes levels in repressed and nonrepressed cells indicate that Trp regulation is normal, with only minor quantitative variations, in hybrids between E coli and Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis. Our results support the idea that a repressor-operator mechanism for regulating trp messenger ribonucleic acid production evolved in a common ancestor of the enteric bacteria, and that this repressor-operator recognition has been conversed during the evolutionary divergence of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Pirbenicillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with broad-spectrum activity.
AB  - Pirbenicillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin which inhibited 67% of isolates of Proteus aeruginosa tested in our laboratory, 93% of P. mirabilis, 31% of Enterobacter spp., 41% of Serratia spp., and 58% of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 6.25 mug/ml. Its activity appeared to be inoculum dependent and it was virtually inactive against 10(7) inocula of P. aeruginosa. It was more active than carbenicillin or ticarcillin, but less active than BL-P1654 against P. aeruginosa. Carbenicillin and ticarcillin appeared to be more active than pirbenicillin against Proteus spp., but pirbenicillin was active against some isolates of Klebsiella spp.
TI  - Diversity of beta-lactamase activity among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Various properties (specific activity, inducibility, substrate profile, and susceptibility to inhibitors) of the beta-lactamase activity present in 39 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated during a two-month period in the bacteriology laboratory of a large general hospital were investigated. Among the 39 strains there appeared to be at least 16 distinct enzymes. Most enzymes from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus morganii were active against both penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas those from Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity primarily against cephalosporins. Both types of enzyme were found among strains of Enterobacter. There was a general correlation between amount of enzymic activity and levels of resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. Discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. Discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance may be due to variations in the roles intrinsic mechanisms play in resistance to various antibiotics.
TI  - [Study of bacterial allergy in acute appendicitis by the method of leukocyte migration inhibition in vitro].
AB  - Under study was the effect of various bacterial allergens on the migration of blood leucocytes from capillaries in vitro in 23 patients with acute appendicitis and in 18 healthy individuals. Bacterial allergens wound suppress leucocytes migration in all patients. Most frequently, sensibilization to allergens of hemolytic staphylococcus and hemolytic streptococcus was found. In 4 healthy persons this methods indicated sensibilization to some allergens. The interaction of activity sensibilized lymphocytes and passively sensibilized polynuclears of the appendix with bacterial antigens is assumed to tigger the hyperergic reaction in acute appendicitis.
TI  - [Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides in gram negative bacteria. 1. Molecular and genetic characterization of R-factors (author's transl)].
AB  - With frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to these chemotherapeutics increased. Lately, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus and Pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the university hospital in Zuerich. The resistant phenotype of two representative strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and Serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred by mixed cultivation to E. coli K-12. Multiple resistance of strain 1, and addition, could be transferred to Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Providencia, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. Transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. Spontaneous instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. Conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages MS-2 and If-1 suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular R-factor, belonging to the fi+-type. This suggestion was confirmed by molecular characterization of the resistance plasmids. After transfer of the R-factors of K. pneumoniae 1 (R-FK 1) and Serratia marcescens 2 (R-FK2) into E. coli K-12, plasmid DNA was labelled with (methyl-3H) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. Analysis of plasmid DNA then was carried out by sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral sucrose gradient together with reference plasmids of known molecular weights and sedimentation constants. The analysis revealed that R-FK1 had a molecular weight of 54 X 10(6) and R-FK2 of 50 X 10(6) daltons. The values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open circular forms with an electron microscope. A comparison of the sedimentation profile of labelled plasmid DNA from strain 1 and 14C-labelled DNA of E. coli K-12 (R-FK1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. These smaller plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 1, which did not contain the 54 X 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for the resistant phenotype. The number of copies of R-FK1 in E. coli K-12 was determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of replication. It is discussed that the growing number of isolations of strains of Escherichia, Klebsiella, Serratia, Proteus, Providencia and Pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance phenotype, results from the spread of the R-factor described above among the hospital bacterial flora.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. V.  The inhibitory activity of normal vaginal fluid on Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Normal vaginal fluid from premenopausal volunteers was inoculated with 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH's of 4.3, 4.6 and 4.9. All bacteria were killed at pH 4.3. Nine of 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 12 of 14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at pH 4.6. Only 4 of 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at pH 4.9, while 8 of 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis were killed at the same pH. We conclude that in comparison to the common 0 group strains of Escherichia coli, vaginal fluid is more bactericidal to Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and that these observations may help explain the relative infrequency of bacteriuria owing to the organisms.
TI  - Efficacy of cinoxacin in urinary tract infections.
AB  - Cinoxacin, a new synthetic antibacterial agent with in vitro activity against all species of Enterobacteriaceae, was used in the treatment of urinary tract infections in 20 patients. The dose of cinoxacin was 250 mg orally every 6 h for 10 days. The etiological agents were Escherichia coli in fifteen, Klebsiella-Enterobacter in five, Proteus mirabilis in two, and Providencia in one. The minimal inhibitory concentration for these organisms ranged from 2 to 64 mug/ml. Eleven of the 20 patients had renal involvement by defined criteria, whereas the remaining nine were considered to have bladder bacilluria. The initial strain was eradicated during and immediately after treatment in 19 of 20 cases. At 6 weeks, 65% had sterile urine. Bactericidal urine levels of cinoxacin were obtained in all patients. No significant hematological, renal, hepatic, or gastroenterologic toxicity was noted. Cinoxacin appears to be a safe and useful drug in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  - In a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in Oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated infections. Within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. By age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. Staphylococcus aureus and E coli were isolated more frequently in the younger group, while K pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. A higher frequency of Enterobacter sp and S aureus were isolated among male patients, while Candida albicans and E coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none of these differences by sex were statistically significant. Over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.

AB  
TI  - [Clinical studies on gentamicin (author's transl)].
AB  - Gentamicin (GM) was studied for on its antibacterial activity, absorption, and excretion, effect on the kidney and clinical effects. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibility of E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis to GM was almost the same between the periods of 1964 to 1966 and 1972 to 1974: No tendency of increase of resistance by year was noted. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains showing sensitivity to a concentration of more than 25 mcg/ml were isolated in 12.7%, in the latter period (1972-1974), as compared with the former period (1964-1966), which was 0%. 2. Blood levels: The peak level of GM in blood was obtained at 30 minutes after intramuscular injection to a healthy human. The peak level was 7.6 mcg/ml with 40 mg dose, 8.7 mcg/ml with 60 mg and 10.6 mcg/ml with 80 mg, showing a dose-responding curve. The half-life of GM absorption was 1.1 hours with 40 mg dose, 1.3 hours with 60 mg and 1.6 hours with 80 mg, showing also a dose related tendency. 3. Urinary levels: The peak level of GM in urine, about 200 mcg/ml, was noted in 0-2 hours after intramuscular injection of GM to a healthy human. The urinary recovery was about 44% in 6 hours. 4. Effect on the kidney: The effects of GM on the kidney was studied in rats administering 20 mg/kg once a day for 21 days consecutively. The results obtained are a slight increase (20 mg/dl) in BUN and a slight decrease (2,600 mosm/kg H2O) in urinary osmotic pressure; and urea lysozyme showed tendency to increase from the third day, the same as with kanamycin. Meanwhile, in the histopathological findings of the kidney tissue, the vacuolar degeneration and flattening of renal tubules were noted. Similar findings were obtained with kanamycin in a similar type of experiment. These results indicate that nephrotoxicity of GM is considered to be approximately the same as that of kanamycin. 5. CLINICAL RESULTS: GM was injected into 22 patients with various infectious diseases (respiratory tract infections 7, liver abscess 1, urinary tract infections 14). Excellent efficacy was noted in 7 patients, good in 13 and no effect in 2. The effective rate was 90.9%. No serious side effect was noted in this clinical trial.
TI  - Polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  - Current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. The validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). During 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. In these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4 months before the episode of bacteremia. Only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. Monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). The mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. Prospectively, nine other patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). This study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.
TI  - Derivation and properties of F-prime factors in Escherichia coli carrying nitrogen fixation genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A His+ Nif+ Escherichia coli K12, Hfr strain (UNF43) was constructed by an intergeneric mating between a Klebsiella pneumoniae donor strain (HF3) and a his-HFR E. coli strain (SBI824) which transfers his as an early marker. An F-prime nif plasmid, FN39, carrying genes which correspond to the E. coli chromosomal region, metG gnd his shiA, but excluding purF and aroD, was isolated from UNF43. Translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a P-type R-factor, R68, to FN39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative F-prime, FN68. Sedimentation analysis of both F-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(CCC) DNA species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. It is suggested that the two smallest CCC-DNA species are component replicons of the composite F-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are CCC-dimers. FN68 was transferable in intergeneric matings to Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium but not to Proteus mirabilis; only carbenicillin resistance and sex factor activity were transferred to Erwinia herbicola. nif genes on FN68 were expressed in a Nif- mutant of K. pneumoniae and also in S. typhimurium, which in conventional tests is naturally non-nitrogen-fixing; expression of the his determinant of FN68 became temperature-sensitive in S. typhimurium.
TI  - In vitro studies of cefamandole.
AB  - Cefamandole is a new cephalosporin antibiotic that was tested in vitro against 540 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. A concentration of 0.39 mug/ml inhibited 95% of the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. A concentration of 6.25 mug/ml inhibited over 90% of the isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, 69% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 31% of the isolates of indole-positive Proteus spp. and Enterobacter spp. It was active against most cephalothin-resistant isolates of E. coli but not of K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Twenty-eight-day courses of antibiotics for urinary tract infection.
AB  - A prospective double-blind study was performed in which 30 adult patients with recurrent urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis organisms were treated by twenty-eight-day courses of either ampicillin, 500 mg. four times a day, or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, 2 tablets twice a day. In terms of freedom from infection fifty-six days after the cessation of treatment in both complicated and uncomplicated infections, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole yielded results superior to those of ampicillin. In comparing the results of this study with those of a similar study in which the same agents were given for ten-day courses it appears that only in the complicated infection is there an advantage in giving a prolonged course of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. This study did not generate any evidence to support the extension of ampicillin therapy for urinary tract infection beyond ten days.
TI  - Marked suppression of thyroid function in rats with gram-negative septicemia.
AB  - Gram-negative septicemia was induced in rats by two daily injections of fecal mixture into the thigh, after which the thyroid function was markedly suppressed for 2 days. Iodine metabolism was studied by organ radioassay and by imaging with a multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC) at various time intervals after intravenous injection of 125I. Plasma T3, T4, and TSH, measured by radioimmunoassays, were suppressed, as were the T3-resin uptakes. Fractional blood supply to the thyroid glands of the infected rats, studied by the 81Rb uptake method, was also found to be markedly reduced. Sections of the thyroid glands showed little structural change during the period of marked thyroid suppression. There was no biochemical evidence of renal failure in the septicemic rats.
TI  - Extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid in R factor-harboring Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from 24 different R factor-harboring Enterobacteriaceae was isolated and characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. The R factors represented 15 different patterns of transferable drug resistance found in enterobacteria from an enclosed geographic area. All of the strains contained extrachromosomal, circular DNA molecules within the range of 0.4 to 52 mum. More than one size class of circular DNA molecules was observed in the majority of the extrachromosomal DNA preparations. The buoyant density of the extrachromosomal DNA ranged from 1.700 to 1.720 g/cm3. The majority of the bacteria contained extrachromosomal DNAs of various densities. Three-fourths of the R factors were classified as fi+. The investigation illustrates the extensive variability in the physical characteristics of plasmid DNA from R factor-harboring strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ribostamycin on Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The study of the inhibitory activity of ribostamvcin (Vistamycin), an antibiotic  derived from Streptomyces ribosidificus, on 161 strains of Gram-negative bacilli shows that the antibacterial spectrum of this antibiotic is identical to that of kanamycin. If controlled clinical studies confirm that ribostamycin is less toxic than kanamycin on the otovestibular system, this antibiotic will constitute a real therapeutic advance.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin C, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin C and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. All of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited over 60% of isolates of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. There was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. Cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. There was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.
TI  - Evaluation of amniotic fluid for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies of 117 pregnant women, 83 at term, were instituted to determine the bacteriologic state of amniotic fluid, utilizing both standard aerobic and anaerobic technics. A high association of postpartum infection was found in women who had long periods of premature reptured membranes and many vaginal examinations. Significant organisms including anaerobes, were isolated in many of these instances. Based on the findings of these studies, it is recommended that amniocentesis for aerobic and anaerobic cultures be done when membranes have been ruptured for 8 hours or more, and when the patient has had seven or more vaginal examinations during the course of labor.
TI  - Plasmid-determined beta-lactamase indistinguishable from the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Escherichia coli.
AB  - A plasmid, derived from a naturally occurring strain of Proteus mirabilis, conferred resistance to cephalosporins, apparently mediated by a beta-lactamase indistinguishable from that determined by the chromosomal gene of Escherichia coli K-12. There was evidence for a recombination event between the wild-type plasmid and a defective F factor (Fsp) in the Escherichia coli K-12 culture in which it was stored.
TI  - [Studies on the antibacterial activity of the combination sulfamoxole/trimethoprim (CN 3123) (author's transl)].
AB  - After giving a survey on the situation of antibiotic resistance in the region of  Northern Bavaria during 1973/74 and comparing the activity of a sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) trimethoprim (TMP) combination to other commonly used antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, the results of tests with the new combination of N1-(4,5-dimethyl-2-oxazolyl)-sulfanilamide) (sulfamoxole) and 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzyl)-pyrimidine (trimethoprim) at a ratio of 5:1 (CN 3123; Nevin, Supristol) are compared to those of tests with TMP/SMZ. This was done by correlating the inhibition zone diameters and, on the other hand, by referring to a great number of sensitivity evaluations in routine diagnostic tests. According to the size of the inhibition zone, CN 3123 showed a somewhat greater activity on Enterococcus (fecal streptococci), Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella aerogenes, whereas the TPM/SMZ combination had apparently a stronger antibacterial effect in vitro against Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Achromobacter-group. Analysis of sensitivity readings from routine diagnosis demonstrated accordance of CN 3123 with TMP/SMZ in 92.6% (first series) and 94.2% (second series), respectively. These results should be considered critically in view of the manifold factors which influence sensitivity tests in the agar diffusion method.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of penicillins and cephalosporines in urine  (author's transl)].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), cephalothin (CEF), cefazolin (CEZ), carbenicillin (CAR) and ticarcillin (TIC) were determined against Strep. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Prot. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa in Sensitivity Test Broth (STB) and human urine. Marked differences were seen in MIC between these two media, especially against P. mirabilis strains tested. Against E. coli the MIC of AMP, CEF and CEZ were similar or slightly lower in urine than in STB. MIC for CAR against E. coli were higher in urine. Against K. pneumoniae the MIC for CEF and CEZ were 2-4fold higher in urine than in STB. The activity of CAR and TIC against Ps. aeruginosa was lower in urine. Albeit high concentrations of antibiotics (up to 800fold) no inhibition was achieved in urine against P. mirabilis by AMP, CEF or CEZ. Only against Strep. faecalis all tested antibiotics had lower MIC in urine than in STB.
TI  - Microbiological studies on some bladder irrigation fluids.
AB  - A 1.5% glycine solution has recently been introduced as a bladder irrigation fluid. In this study, glycine solution was compared with two other recognised bladder irrigants (chlorhexidine and noxythiolin) for its inhibitory activity against common urinary tract pathogens. Glycine solution supported the growth of nearly 50% of the bacterial strains tested whereas chlorhexidine and noxythiolin were completely inhibitory. In quantitative studies with selected strains it was found that growth could be initiated from as few as 200 organisms/ml. It was concluded that glycine solution was capable of supporting bacterial growth and thus, from a microbiological viewpoint, was unsuitable as a bladder irrigant.
TI  - In vitro studies with sisomicin and gentamicin.
AB  - Sisomicin and gentamicin were tested in vitro against 222 clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria using the ICS agar dilution procedure. The two drugs were comparable in terms of overall activity although statistical analyses of the data revealed significant differences in their activity against several genera. Sisomicin was significantly more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.001), Proteus mirabilis (p less than 0.005), and Escherichia coli (p less than 0.01); gentamicin was significantly more active against Klebsiella (p less than 0.001). In most instances, 4.0 mug/ml of either drug was inhibitory for 90% or more of the isolates of each genus tested.
TI  - [The application of Actihaemyl in chronically inflamed and dystrophic urinary bladder (author's transl)].
AB  - The effect of automated continuous irrigation treatment with Actihaemyl on bacterial growth in the infected urinary bladder was tested using an experimental model. The result was that instillation alone of this preparation promoted growth of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the infected bladder. With simultaneous application of Framycetinsulfate or Kanamycin the growth of Pr. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa was totally suppressed in the "urine", and the growth of E. coli extensively low. At the same time there was a clear reduction in the bacterial count in the coagulum that served as a substitute bladder wall. Thus a urinary tract infection is a contraindication for local treatment with Actihaemyl of a tropically disturbed urinary bladder inasmuch as an effective antibiotic is not added to the instillate. With the latter combination, however, a therapeutic trial is justified in chronic, inflammatory, dystrophic bladders.
TI  - Chemistry and antibacterial activity of nitrobenzofurans.
AB  - Thirteen 2-methylbenzofurans were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was investigated. 2-Methyl-3-nitrobenzofuran and analogs containing 7-NO2, 5-NO2, 7-Br, 7-CONH2, and 7-CF3 substituents are bacteriostatic. The spectrum of activity of these compounds is similar to nitrofurazone; however, a strain of E. coli Br which has increased resistance to nitrofurazone did not show increased resistance to 3,7-dinitro-2-methylbenzofuran (1). The 3-nitro-2-methylbenzofurans are labile in solution (T1/2 0.8-3.5 hr at 37 degrees, pH 7.0). The solvolysis product of 1 was identified as alpha,6-dinitro-o-cresol (15). The 3-nitrobenzofurans are more potent in minimal media than in Penassay broth. This greater potency can be abolished by addition of casamino acids and tryptophan to the minimal media.
TI  - Microbial formation of nitrosopyrrolidine from nitrosoproline.
AB  - The fate of orally administered NPro was determined in rats. Unchanged NPro could be recovered in the urine, while NPy was detected in the faeces of two of three rats tested. After successive administration of NPro to the same rats, their intestinal contents were inoculated into media containing NPro to test for NPy formation. Decarboxylation of NPro occurred in the faeces cultures from those rats whose faeces had contained NPy. When the faeces from 10 mice were inoculated into the NPro media, all gave negative reactions for NPro decarboxylation. However, when the faeces of eight rats and those of 15 rabbits were tested, two rats and one rabbit exhibited NPy formation. L-Pro and NPro decarboxylase reactions were tested on 24 strains of bacteria and three strains each of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis isolated from rat intestines. It was found that seven bacteria gave a positive reaction with L-pro decarboxylation, while only two species, both belonging to Pseudomonas, could decarboxylate NPro.
TI  - Hyperbilirubinemia in infants with urinary tract infection.
AB  - In the light of a retrospective analysis of 213 case records of infants with urinary tract infections, hyperbilirubinemia was disclosed in 19 cases. In 7 cases jaundice was the main cause of admission of these children to the hospital. It was observed mainly in the youngest age group up to 3 months. Jaundice was hemolytic in some cases and hepatic in others. Urinary tract malformations had no effect on the frequency of jaundice in urinary tract infection or on its intensity.

AB  - Bacteriological investigation of urinary samples from 1,926 non-hospitalised patients with documented or suspected acute urinary tract infection revealed organisms pathogenic for the urinary tract in 56.4% of the patients, who came from various parts of West Germany. Prevalent pathogens were E. coli (69%) and Proteus mirabilis (14%). E. coli and P. mirabilis demonstrated a low rate of resistance against ampicillin, the cephalosporines, gentamicin, tobramycin, and also against nitrofurantoin, nalidixine acid and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The situation was more unfavourable in the case of Klebsiella and indolpositive Proteus species however, there being a noticeably high proportion of strains resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin.

AB  - Among studied 40 bacterial cultures, 17 strains catalysed hydroxylaminolysis of I.-asparagine and L-glutamine, and among these cultures seven strains belonged to the Pseudomonas genus. Extracts of the cells of Ps. boreopolis 526 (MGU), Ps. aurantiaca IBFM B-14, and Ps. septica IBFM B-40 had the maximum deamidase activity during the stage of decelerated growth. The activity of L-asparaginase 2 was practically the same upon various ways of disintegration of the cells of Ps. aurantiaca IBFM B-14: ballistic technique, ultrasound, extrusion form the solid state. Production of beta-aspartylhydroxamic acid by L-asparaginase 2 depended on the concentration of hydroxylamine and protein in the reaction mixture and on the duration of the reaction.
TI  - [Experience in use of amoxicillin for treatment of acute cystitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Seventeen cases of acute simple cystitis were treated by oral administration of amoxicillin at a daily dose of 1.0 g (250 mg X 4 in a day) for consecutive 7 days, and the following results were obtained. 1. Amoxicillin was remarkably effective in 11 of total 17 cases, effective in 2, slightly effective in 2 and non-effective in 2. 2. In terms of effect against isolated bacteria, amoxicillin was remarkably effective against 6 of 11 strains of E. coli, effective against 2, slightly effective against 2 and non-effective against 1, remarkably effective against 2 of 3 strains of Proteus mirabilis and non-effective against 1, and remarkably effective against one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. 3. There was no severe side effect specially to be mentioned.
TI  - Inhibition of cell wall synthesis by sulfonamides and trimethoprim.
AB  - The hypothesis that defective cell wall synthesis seems to represent a final common pathway of drug-induced injury either within the bacterial cell or on its surface was supported by two different findings: (1) sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, either alone or in combination, induced morphological findings in various Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains identical to those found after incubation with so-called cell-wall-active antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) and (2) cell-wall-defective bacteria (L forms, spheroblasts) were resistant to sulfonamides and/or trimethoprim as compared to their normal bacterial cells.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activities of sisomicin and gentamicin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Sisomicin was found to be more active on a weight basis than gentamicin against Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and indole-positive Proteus. Gentamicin was more active than sisomicin against Escherichia coli, Serratia sp., Enterobacter sp., and Proteus mirabilis. Both antibiotics were very active against methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. Cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against Proteus mirabilis. Both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against S. aureus, were slightly more active against K. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against E. coli. All strains of indole-positive Proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. Eighty-eight percent of Enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin and cephalothin, respectively. Peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110 mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg) in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. These levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. There was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. The percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. The half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.
TI  - [In vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  - In vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (AB-PC), carbenicillin (CB-PC), sulbenicillin (SB-PC) cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ) and gentamicin (GM). Fifty three % of Escherichia coli strains 53.3% of Citrobacter sp., 80% of Proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of Morganella and 80% of Bacteroides sp. were susceptible (MIC being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to AB-PC. The eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. CB-PC and SB-PC were almost as effective as AB-PC against Escherichia coli and Citrobacter sp. They were less active against Klebsiella sp., but more active against Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus group and Pseudomonas sp. than AB-PC, SB-PC was more effective than CB-PC against Pseudomonas sp. The strains of Pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of CB-PC and SB-PC were pyocyanine-negative strains. All strains (100%) of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. were susceptible to CET and CEZ, while none of Enterobacter sp. , Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris. Morganella, Rettgerella, Providencia and Pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. The MICs of CET and CEZ against Bacteroides sp. were moderately low. Some strains of Providencia and Alkaligenes sp. were resistant of GM but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high MICs against Bacteroides sp. When seen from the MIC distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of human peritoneal fluid.
AB  - Cell free peritoneal fluids from 23 normal women had antimicrobial activity which was directed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against yeasts. The activity was bacteriostatic or bactericidal and seemed to be due to the presence of a variety of factors which varied in their heat stability and dependence on complement. Lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not responsible for all the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - DNA repair in Proteus mirabilis. III.Survival, dimer excision, and UV reactivation in comparison with Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Measurements of UV sensitivity of wildtype cells (wt) and UV senistive mutants of E. coli and P. mirabilis suggest that the increased sensitivity of P. mirabilis (wt) is due either to incomplete repair of DNA lesions or to additive lethality probably as a result of UV induction of defective phage(s) present in P. mitabilis (Taubeneck, 1967). Direct estimates of the rate of pyrimidine dimer excision and a comparison of the UV reactivation capacity of E. coli and P. mirabilis for the temperate phages lambda and pi 1, respectively, support this conclusion.
TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria from urine.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from the urine of 400 hospital inpatients and 483 outpatients were identified and the in vitro sensitivity of these organisms against 12 antibacterial agents currently used in the treatment of urinary tract infections was determined. There was little difference in the distribution of organisms between the two groups. Escherichia coli was predominant, accounting for 58% of the inpatients and 66% of the outpatients. Klebsiella was present in 15% of the inpatients as against 7% in the outpatients. Proteus mirabilis 9% inpatients and 8% outpatients and Enterococcus, 7% inpatients and 5% outpatients made up most of the remainder. The different organisms showed varying sensitivity patterns to the antibiotics tested. The commonly used antibiotics with the broadest spectrum were cephalexin and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and clinical pharmacology of ticarcillin and carbenicillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity and human pharmacology of ticarcillin, a semisynthetic penicillin more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas, were compared. There has been no increase in resistance to ticarcillin of Pseudomonas strains over the past 5 years, but resistance of indole-positive Proteus and Serratia strains has been documented. After intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 1 g of ticarcillin, mean peak levels occurred at 1 h (26.9 mug/ml) with a decline over 6 h (6.8 mug/ml). Serum half-life was 84 min. Dilution of ticarcillin lidocaine reduced pain on i.m. injection but did not alter serum levels. Blood levels after 1 g i.m. are adequate to treat infections produced by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and some Enterobacter, but not Pseudomonas. After rapid intravenous infusion of 3 and 5 g, mean peak serum levels of ticarcillin were slightly lower for 1 h than those achieved with carbenicillin. Probenecid administered before infusion produced increases in blood levels, half-lives, and volume of distribution. The biological half-life of ticarcillin was 72 min compared to 66 min with carbenicillin. There was a larger volume of distribution for ticarcillin than carbenicillin (15 liters versus 14 liters). The ticarcillin half-life when administered with probenecid was 108 min. Urinary recovery of ticarcillin was 77% against 95% of carbenicillin. However, approximately 10% of ticarcillin is recovered as penicilloic acid so that 95% of an intravenously administered dose is recovered.

TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid esters, carbonitriles, and carboxamides.
AB  - A series of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid esters,  carbonitriles, and carboxamides (2a-k) was synthesized and initially evaluated (dose range 50-400 mg/kg) in mice infected with Escherichia coli. Only two derivatives, the ethyl and butyl esters of 1-ethyl-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-7-methyl-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, protected the animals against E. coli and several other gram-negative bacterial pathogenic infections. A pro-drug type of mechanism appears to be operable since neither agent showed in vitro activity.
TI  - Cholesterol incorporation into bacterial membranes.
AB  - The wall-covered bacteria Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus megaterium, and Proteus mirabilis incorporated exogenous cholesterol into their cytoplasmic membrane in quantities resembling those incorporated by sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas. Cholesterol incorporation into the outer membrane of P. mirabilis was much more restricted than into the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Micrococcal urinary-tract infections in young women.
AB  - In a prospective study in young women, novobiocin-resistant subgroup-3 micrococci were the second commonest cause, after Escherichia coli; of acute urinary infections. Proteus mirabilis was the only other causative organism. Symptoms, pyuria, or possible aetiological factors were the same in micrococcal and coliform infections. The infecting micrococcus "biotype" was only rarely found among the normal flora of the genitourinary tract of young women, though other micrococci and staphylococci were commonly present. Evidently, the infecting micrococci are selectively pathogenic in the urinary tract. Micrococcal infections, like coliform infections; commonly followed sexual intercourse, but there was no evidence that the micrococci were sexually transmitted. The infecting biotype was rarely found in the male urethra or prepuce.
TI  - Amino-acid composition of the covalent rigid-layer lipoprotein in cell walls of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Cell walls of Proteus mirabilis in the stationary phase of growth contain a lipoprotein in covalent linkage to peptidoglycan and probably also in free form in the outer membrane. The protein moiety of this lipoprotein is composed of about 50 amino acids and has an approximate molecular weight of 5500. The Proteus lipoprotein has glycine and phenylalanine as specific components which are not present in lipoproteins of other enteric bacteria. Treatment of the peptidoglycan-lipoprotein complex of Proteus with trypsin leaves lysine as the only lipoprotein amino acid attached to the peptidoglycan. This suggests that in P. mirabilis, as in Escherichia coli, the lipoprotein is linked to the peptidoglycan by its C-terminal lysine residue.
TI  - Effect of surfactants on antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The effectiveness of surfactants as potentiators of antibiotic activity on several resistant strains of bacteria, selected from clinical sources and laboratory collections, was studied using a tube dilution assay. Bacterial strains included members of the Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Tween 80 (Tw80), a mixture of n-alkyldimethyl betaines (L14), and alpha-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (TCP) were tested in combination with pencillin G (PenG), methicillin (Met), streptomycin (Sm), polymyxin B (PmB), and chlortetracycline (CTC). Growth response to the drug combinations was compared with the response to each drug alone. CTAB and L14 but not Tw80 or TCP were found to potentiate the activity of CTC on strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Studies on the inhibition of protein synthesis by CTC in cells of a strain of E. coli suggested that the surfactants increased the uptake of antibiotic into the cells. CTAB and L14 almost completely sensitized strains of P. mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli to PmB. With the exception of K. pneumoniae, TCP was also effective in potentiating the activity of PmB on the above strains whereas Tw80 showed potentiation only with a strain of E. coli. CTAB and L14 but not TCP or Tw80 potentiated the activity of PenG but not Met on strains of staphylococci. Studies of penicillinase in the cells suggested that the surfactants inhibited the formation of this enzyme possibly at the level of induction. None of the surfactants were found to potentiate the activity of Sm.
TI  - Nation-wide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer: bacterial strains from the urine, stool, and upper respiratory tract.
AB  - All-nation data of antibiotic resistance of about 200 000 bacterial strains isolated in the Slovak Socialist Republic in 1973 have been grouped, and compared, by means of a computer, into resistances of strains isolated from the urine, from upper respiratory tract (URT), from stool and from other pathological materials. In general, urine strains of all species investigated were found to be more resistant to "main antibiotics", and, suprisingly, to septrin, than strains from other sources. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and, notably, of Klebsiella-Enterobacter from the URT are generally more susceptible to antibiotics than strains of these species isolated from other sources. Urine strains of E. coli, P. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa show a high degree of resistance almost to all antibiotics, with exception of gentamicin and colistin (for E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa only). Further antibiotics for combatting these strains are urgently needed. Similar computer-assisted monitoring of strains from the very specified sources may be easily adapted for individual hospitals, clinics and even wards.

TI  - Prevalence of gram-negative rods in the normal pharyngeal flora.
AB  - We obtained throat cultures from 100 randomly selected people free from any chronic upper or lower respiratory disease who did not work in a hospital and who had not experienced any acute illness or received any antibacterial therapy in the 4 weeks preceding culture. Eighteen percent harbored either a species of Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their pharynx. In all cases, colony counts were low, the majority being detected in broth media selective for Gram-negative rods. There were no clear-cut age or sex distributions of Gram-negative pharyngeal carriage. These data imply that, in at least some cases, isolation of Gram-negative rods from sputum of untreated patients may be a normal finding, and that in some patients with pulmonary infection, the pretreatment, upper respiratory tract flora may serve as the source of subsequent superinfection with Gram-negative rods.
TI  - Extensive segments of the Escherichia coli K12 chromosome in Proteus mirabilis diploids.
AB  - Various Escherichia coli K12 Hfr donors transfer at low frequency portions of the E. coli genome to Proteus mirabilis. By remating such Proteus hybrids with the same or a different E. coli Hfr strain, other genetic characters could be added to yield diploid Proteus hybrids which contained more than 30 percent of the E. coli genome. The extent of the E. coli genetic material in these unstable Proteus diploid hybrids included segments with the following selected markers: gal, lac, ara, mel, mtl, and malA. Unselected markers known to map throughout this region of the chromosome were also detected in these hybrids. Among the markers expressed in Proteus hybrids with the E. coli malA region was the receptor site for coliphage lambda. Although plaques were not seen, lambda was adsorbed by the Proteus hybrids. Examination of DNA from the various Proteus hybrids by CsCl density gradient centrifugation showed a satellite component of E. coli DNA with a size that corresponded to the extent of the E. coli genome present as determined by genetic analysis.
TI  - Bacterial studies of Clindamycin-associated colitis. A preliminary report.
AB  - The cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. To test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. We were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. Those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. Those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. A third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. Thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the anaerobic microflora of the colon. The symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. Resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.
TI  - [Biocenotic dynamics of liquid sewage in the process of its biological purification at aeration stations].
AB  - A study was made of biological purification of sewage at the aeration stations on the quantitative composition of the main indicator microbes--of bacteria of the coliform group and of the fecal coliform bacilli, enterococci, Proteus, and also pathogenic enterobacteria. There was found a difference in the behaviour of different species of Proteus, i.e. reduction in the process of purification in the numbers of Pr. mirabilis, and a sharp elevation of Pr. morganii content. There was noted an insignificant amount of Pr. vulgaris both before and after the biological purification. It was found that dynamics of biocenosis was influenced by air temperature at the time of collection of the samples. A possibility of reproduction of coliform bacilli serving as one of the factors of autopurification of sewage during the biological purification was confirmed.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer. An introduction into the analysis of multiple antibiotic resistance.
AB  - One-year surveillance of single and multiple antibiotic resistance of 8 species of so-called "Problem Bacteria" by computer analysis of data obtained from 18 Public Health Laboratories in Slovakia in 1973 enables to establish the most frequently occuring spectra of multiple drug resistance which would point to the spread of typical R plasmids among the Problem bacteria investigated. As an introduction, we surveyed the mode of testing of Problem bacteria in individual PHLs against antibiotics - drugs of choice. Iw was important to find out whether strains belonging to Problem bacteria investigated are tested against sufficient number of antibacterial drugs. Our study shows that the percentage of bi- and multiple drug resistance in almost all bacterial species investigated depend on the number of antibiotics used in tests in vitro as single discs. The more antibiotic discs are used to test the strains, the more chance the laboratory has to register the true picture of multiresistance to antibiotics. Our study also shows that the testing in the PHLs associated to the computer study in this respect is inadequate. Moreover, the increasing complexity and proportion of multiple drug resistance in Problem Bacteria - with a notable exception of Salmonellae - forces the PHLs to use more and more discs so that using two Petri dishes full of discs - 12 to 15 discs - begins to be necessary in testing of most of the Problem bacteria under investigation.
TI  - Susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  - Combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. Synergistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were noted against most strains of E. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. Of 16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of E. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin G with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. The marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.

AB  - As the results of laboratory and clinical investigation with a new tetracycline derivate, PT-122M (doxycycline) was performed with the results which may lead to the following conclusions. 1) In vitro antibacterial activity: The minimal inhibitory concentration of doxycycline (DOTC) was measured by an agar plate dilution method. The MIC of DOTC against 60 strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus isolated from otorrhoea was distributed over a range of 0.2 approximately 1.56 mcg/ml and 12.5 approximately 50 mcg/ml. Furthermore, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 3.13 to 100 mcg/ml. 2) Concentration in blood: The blood level of DOTC in healthy adults who were given 100 mg of DOTC intravenous reached maximum of 1.97 mcg/ml on the average 15 minutes after injection. Even at 12 hours after intravenous injection clinically effective serum DOTC concentration of 0.47 mcg/ml was still demonstrable. 3) CLINICAL RESULTS: PT-122M (DOCT) was intravenously injected into 30 cases with typical infection in the field of otorhinolaryngology. It was excellent in 15 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 3 cases, and poor in 2 cases. When the cases in which it was excellent and good were considered together, good results were obtained in 25 cases, a ratio of effectiveness being 83 per cent. 4) Side effect: The comparative examination of hepatic function, electrolyte and auditory acuity before and after injection showed no significant disturbance. No side effect was shown with the intravenous injection.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. I.  The role of vaginal pH.
AB  - The pH of the vaginal introitus was compared to quantitative cultures of the introital mucosa (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus faecalis) in 800 samples. Introital carriage of more than 100 bacteria per ml. was significantly greater at pH of more than 4.4 (p less than 0.005) when compared to mucosal pH of less than or equal to 4.4.
TI  - Variation in expression of sex factor genes in the Proteus-Providencia group relative to Escherichia coli.
AB  - Several instances of anomalous expression of genes introduced from Escherichia coli K-12 into Proteus mirabilis have been described. It is shown here that control of sex pilus synthesis directed by the F-like R factor R1 and its depressed derivatives R1-16 (O-C) and R1-19 (i-minus) is also anomalous in P. mirabilis. Piliation in cells bearing the depressed plasmids is expressed at a lower level than in E. coli K-12, and repression is absent in R1-carrying cells. Preliminary results show a similar effect in Providencia. In Proteus morganii, a similarly reduced level of piliation in R1-16-+ or R1-19-+ cultures is observed, but an intermediate level of repression occurs in R1-+ cultures. Less extensive data suggest that expression of the sex factor genes of an R factor of the N incompatibility group differs far less between E. coli and P. mirabilis hosts. Possible bases for these effects are discussed.
TI  - A review of 105 necropsies in captive baboons (Papio cynocephalus).
AB  - In contrast to the findings in newly caught babboons in Africa, the leading cause of death in captivity in America was a pneumonia and enteritis complex. Bacterial species such as Proteus morgani, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas paracolon, pathogenic Escherichia coli and cocci have been isolated in association with a pneumoenteric syndrome of 35 newborn baboons, including neonates. The majority of these animals died with pulmonary factors such as anoxia and pneumonia.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.
TI  - [Condition of microflora of the nasopharynx in immunization with live influenza vaccine for oral administration].
AB  - The authors present data concerning the state of the microflora of the nasopharynx in the immunization of adults and schoolchildren with the living influenza vaccine for oral administration. During the vaccinal process there occurred qualitative changes in the microbial pattern of the nasopharynx and a reduction in the level of the salivary lysozyme. The most pronounced changes were seen after the first vaccination, when the seeding efficiency of the pathogenic staphylococcus the E. coli and the Pr. mirabilis increased considerably. At the same time the incidence of isolation of the pathogenic staphylococcus, neisseria, and hemolytic streptococcus was decreased. The mentioned changes in the microbial flora directly depended on the dynamics of the survival of the vaccine influenza virus.
TI  - Metabolism of deoxycorticosterone by human fecal flora.
AB  - 21-Dehydroxylation, a feature of metabolism of corticoids in humans, was observed in mixed cultures of fecal flora of normal individuals on a Western diet. The model substrate, 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), was metabolized to 3alpha-21-dihydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one (THDOC), 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan20-one (pregnanolone), and to two unidentified structures, metabolites X and Y. DOC was not metabolized in all media supporting growth of fecal flora. Conversion required an initial pH between 6.0 and 8.0. 21-Dehydroxylation occurred within 4 days of incubation in media inoculated with 10-minus 1 to 10-minus 7 fecal suspensions. In higher dilutions, containing obligatory anaerobes only, DOC was converted to metabolite X and sometimes also to metabolite Y. The yield of pregnanolone was related to the promptness with which the specimen was processed, to the presence of cysteine in the medium, and to the concentrationof substrate (optimum, 16 to 64 mug of DOC per ml). The yield of THDOC was related to the delay in the processing of the specimen, the concentration of substrate (maximum at 256 mug/ml), and aeration of the culture. Pure cultures of aerobic organism of fecal origin either failed to metabolize DOC or converted it to metabolite Y. Pure cultures of fecal anaerobes converted DOC to metabolite X and sometimes also to metabolite Y. Neither THDOC nor pregnanolone was produced by pure cultures.
TI  - Infection caused by Proteus mirabilis strains with transferrable gentamicin-resistance factors.
AB  - During a period of 10 weeks, four patients in one hospital became infected with gentamicin-resistant Proteus mirabilis. In two of them septicaemia associated with indwelling catheters developed, one had urinary tract and wound infections, and in the fourth patient the organism was isolated from a superficial wound. The P. mirabilis strains showed multiple drug resistance. Strains form the first three patients were apparently identical and were sensitive to tobramycin. Their gentamicin resistance was not transferable to Escherichia coli K12, but could be transferred to another strain of P. mirablilis (PM13-3). The fourth strain was resistant to tobramycin; its gentamicin/tobramycin resistance was transferable to E. coli K12.
TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Authenic tracheobronchial secretions/exudates (TBSE) were aspirated under direct  vision via a sterile catheter passed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic bronchitis. TBSE, saliva and blood were obtained during long-term administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and were assayed for drug content. Before and during treatment TBSE were cultured qualitatively and quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and viruses. Treatment with TMP-SMX was associated with a decrease in the recovery of Hemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis; however, little effect was observed on the typically nonpathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. TMP was found in saliva at concentrations greater than in serum. Both TMP and SMX entered TBSE in absolute and relative concentrations sufficient to take advantage of the potential for synergy against susceptible microorganisms. Patient tolerance of TMP-SMX was generally good and several patients reported a decrease in production of sputum during treatment.
TI  - Experience with detailed surveillance of nosocomial infection.
AB  - Infection rates have been determined in a 332 bed university hospital using an efficient surveillance program. This computerized program analyzed, summarized and returned infection reports in six days. The efficiency rate of this system was 80 per cent as determined by prevalence survey. The mean nosocomial infection rate for the 12 month study period was 10.8 per cent. Neurology, medicine, neurosurgery, surgery and urology ahd the highest attack rates. Urinary tract infections composed 44 per cent of the total and predominated on seven of the 11 services. Escherichia coli predominated in infections of the urinary tract, surgical wounds and blood and ranked third in respiratory infections. Escherichia coli, klebsiella, pseudomonas and proteus mirabilis accounted for 61 per cent of the isolates. There is a need for efficient reporting of hospital infections to establish effective preventives.

Bacteriological swabs and sampling with broth were evaluated as methods of detecting contamination. Gross contamination was detected by broth sampling on occasions when swabbing failed to reveal contamination. The presence of up to 18% by volume of residual air within the apparatus was detected. A method of ensuring elimination of all air is described and studies showed that disinfection was then complete.
TI  - Characterization of a non-type-specific antigen(s) associated with group A streptococcal type 12 M protein.
AB  - The sharing of one and possibly two or more non-type-specific antigens by most strains of groups A, C, and G streptococci is described. With the exception of a single strain of Proteus mirabilis, this antigen(s) was not found among strains of groups B and D streptococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., and Salmonella sp. The non-type-specific antigen(s) could not be separated from M protein by fractionation with various saturations of ammonium sulfate or by column chromatography with calcium hydroxylapatite even though the latter method allowed the recovery of a fraction of M protein which was free of the cross-reactive antigen(s). The resistance of this non-type-specific antigen(s) to hot acid extraction and its sensitivity to treatment with trypsin differentiate it from the T and R antigens of group A streptococci, both of which are trypsin resistant. Co-precipitation of both type-and non-type-specific antigens occurred with type-specific antiserum and suggested that the type- and non-type-specific antigens represent either different, covalently bonded antigenic determinants on the same protein or different proteins noncovalently linked together.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cinoxacin in vitro.
AB  - Cinoxacin is a new synthetic compound similar chemically and in antimicrobial activity to oxolonic acid and nalidixic acid. It is most effective against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, but at concentrations expected in the urine it is inhibitory for all species of Enterobacteriaceae. Relative to nalidixic acid, cinoxacin has slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity, less inoculum effect probably due to less heterogeneity in the susceptibility of bacterial cells, and less inhibition by high concentrations of serum protein. Both drugs are more active in an acid than an alkaline medium. Glucose can specifically antagonize the inhibitory effect against P. mirabilis. In urine the bactericidal rate and effect are decreased. Resistance to cinoxacin can be developed quickly by serial transfers in vitro. Some nonresistant organisms remained viable in bactericidal drug concentrations. The in vivo importance of the favorable features of cinoxacin must be determined by clinical trials.
TI  - Treatment of chronic prostatitis. Comparison of Minocycline and Doxycycline.
AB  - The results of minocycline and doxycycline therapy in 41 patients with chronic prostatitis and minocycline therapy in 6 patients with acute prostatitis were evaluated. In the comparative study of chronic prostatitis, minocycline and doxycycline were given on the same dosage schedule, milligram for milligram: a loading dose of 200 mg. followed by 100 mg. twicd daily. Over-all clinical responses to therapy with either agent were generally satisfactory, and no statistically significant difference was demonstrable in this regard. In the group with chronic prostatitis treated wtih minocycline, however, all symptoms manifested before therapy had disappeared after therapy even where over-all results had been judged unsatisfactory. This was not true of the group with chronic prostatitis treated with doxycycline. Symptoms in 6 patients persisted after therapy had been terminated. Here the difference in results between the two groups was found to be statistically significant. A review of symptoms two to eight weeks after therapy revealed no significant difference between the two groups. After two years only 6 patients in the entire group with chronic prostatitis had returned with recurrent problems: 3 of these patients had been treated with minocycline and 3 had been treated with doxycycline. Results of therapy in the small series of patients with acute prostatitis treated with minocycline were generally satisfactory.
TI  - Electron microscope heteroduplex studies of sequence relations among bacterial plasmids: identification and mapping of the insertion sequences IS1 and IS2 in F and R plasmids.
AB  - Heteroduplex experiments between the plasmid R6 and one strand of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a lambda phage carrying the insertion sequence IS1 show that IS1 occurs on R6 at the two previously mapped junctions of resistance transfer factor (RTF) DNA with R-determinant DNA. From previous heteroduplex experiments, it then follows that IS1 occurs at the same junctions in R6-5, R100-1, and R1 plasmids. Heteroduplex experiments with the DNA from a lambda phage carrying the insertion sequence IS2 show that one copy of IS2 occurs in R6, R6-5, and R100-1 (but not R1) at a point within the RTF with coordinates 67.5 TO 68.9 kilobase units (kb). In an accompanying paper, Ptashne and Cohen (1975) show that the insertion sequence IS3 occurs on R6 and R6-5. R100-25, a traC mutant, differs from its parent R100-1 only in that it contains an additional copy of IS1 inserted within the tra gene region of 82.1 kb. R100-31, atraX, TC-s mutant of R100-1, is deleted in R100-1 sequences starting at one of the IS3 termini (46.9 kb) and extending with RTF to 61.0 kb. Heteroduplex studies of F plasmids with the DNA of a lambda phage bearing insertion sequence IS2 show that the sequence of F with coordinates 16.3-17.6F is IS2. The occurrence of IS1 at the two junctions of R-determinant DNA and RTF DNA in R plasmids provides a structural basis to explain the mechanism of the previously observed formation of molecules containing one RTF unit and several tandem copies of the R-determinant unit, when R plasmids in Proteus mirabilis are grown in the presence of antibiotics, and the segregation of an R plasmid into an RTF unit and an R-determinant unit. In general, correlation of our results with previous studies shows that insertion sequences play a role in a variety of F- and R-related intra- and intermolecular recombination phenomena.
TI  - The prophylactic use of Keflex and Keflin in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - Although the number of severe infections occurring after vaginal hysterectomy are few,they sometimes result in the death of a patient or a protracted hospital course. A prospective double-blind study, using Keflex and Keflin in theraputic doses,was undertaken to elucidate more clearly the effect upon morbidity in vaginal hysterectomy. Cultures were taken form a catheterized urine specimen and the cervix of all patients before surgery. Cultures were repeated on the fourth postoperative day. Morbidity was defined as an oral temperature of 100.6 degrees F. on two separate occasions, 4hours apart in the postoperative period. Of the 60 patients studied thus far, 43.3 percent of the 30 placebo patients exceeded these febrile limits and were determined as thosewith infectious morbidity. Only 13.3 of the 30 patients who received the prophalatic drug showed this morbidity.
TI  - Substituted 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones.
AB  - A series of 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones has been prepared. A new synthesis of 4-alkyl-1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones involving the oxidative ring closure of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde 2-(2-hydroxyethylalkyl)semicarbazones is described. The in vitro testing of the compounds against a variety of bacteria is reported.
TI  - The use of analytical isoelectric focusing for detection and identification of beta-lactamases.
AB  - BETA-Lactamases (EC. 3.5.2.6) from strains of Gram-negative bacteria have been studied using analytical isoelectric focusing. This permits a visual comparison of the patterns of beta-lactamase bands produced by enzymes from different organisms. Purification of crude intracellular preparations is unnecessary and the technique is sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate beta-lactamase in mutants previously reported to lack the enzyme. R that have not been distinguished from one another biochemically or immunologically can be differentiated by isoelectric focusing. Conversely, the enzymes specified by the R factors RTEM, R1 and RGN14, with identical isoelectric focusing patterns have the same biochemical properties. Chromosomal and R-factor-mediated beta-lactamases from single strains have been separated and their identities confirmed by immunoisoelectric focusing. R factor-mediated enzymes gave identical isoelectric focusing patterns irrespective of the host strain. Isoelectric focusing can therefore be used to observe the transfer of beta-lactamases carried by R factors.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.

TI  - Interactions of heteroaromatic compounds with nucleic acids. 2. Influence of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of intercalating ligands.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a systematic study on the effects of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds interacting with DNA by intercalation. All the compounds tested are derived from proflavine and acridine orange analogs with different heteroatoms in the middle ring. Their base and sequence specificities were determined by differential dialysis of the ligand against DNA samples of differing G-C content. The main results indicate that (a) the introduction of a phenyl substituent into one of the two available positions of the middle ring increases or decreases the G-C specificity of the ligand depending on the position where the substitution takes place; (b) compounds of the substitution type of neutral red (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethyl-amino-phenazine) show unexpectedly high G-C specificities and (c) DNA ligands of pronounced sequence specificity for adjacent G-C pairs can be constructed by combining the structural elements of neutral red with an additional phenyl residue in the same molecule. The further study of compounds related to the phenylated neutral red revealed that the G-C specificity can be improved or destroyed by additional substituents. The comparison of the G-C specificity and the DNA-affinity data of the compounds studied leads to the suggestion that the specificity arises mainly from electronic factors which are strongly controlled through steric constraints on possible ocmplex geometries. As a basis for the discussion a possible structure for the DNA complex of the phenylated neutral red is considered in which the extra phenyl ring at N-5 of the phenazinium system, protrudes into the large groove of the DNA helix while the tricyclic part of the ligand is inserted between the DNA base-pairs.
TI  - Herd studies on coliform mastitis.
AB  - Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63, 10, and 11 percent, respectively, of 158 coliform organisms recovered from mastitis cases in 8 California herds. The severity and nature of the coliform mastitis problem were found to vary greatly among herds but were characteristic for each of 4 herds studied in detail.
TI  - [Ciclacillin therapy for diseases of the urinary tract].
AB  - In our own controlled bacteriological investigations, ciclacillin showed a good effect in urological infections at a daily dosage of 3 g for 10 days. The efficacy is comparable to that of ampicillin and corresponds to that of the double blind trials bescribed in the literature. The specially good tolerance is worthy of note.
TI  - R factors from Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris.
AB  - Eighty-nine R factors were transmitted by conjugation to Escherichia coli K12 from isolates of Proteus hauseri (P. mirabilis plus P vulgaris). More than half were non-selftranmissible. The remainder included plasmids assigned to the previously defined groups FII,A-C complex, J, N and P, as well as some not belonging to any knwon compatibility groups. R factors from strains isolated in India, Thailand and Japan carried plasmids whose inheritance was extremely unstable in E. coli K12. All belonged to a new compatibility group, V.
TI  - Rapid detection and identification of enteric bacteria from blood cultures.
AB  - The BACTEC radiometric system and Inolex Enteric I card were used in conjunction  for the rapid detection and presumptive identification of enteric gram-negative rods in blood cultures. Excellent correlation was obtained between the Inolex card and routine identification techniques when organisms from both artificially inoculated and clinical blood cultures were studied. In many instances, the culture report was available less than 24 hr after receipt of the specimen.
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section.
AB  - Using a random selection procedure, 100 patients were evaluated in order to determine the value of prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section. All patients were evaluated for febrile morbidity, and specific infection sites were recorded. Significant differences were found between the treated and control groups and between cesarean sections performed prior to the onset of labor and after the onset of labor.
TI  - [Experimental investigations concerning spectrum, serum concentration, and excretion of Spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  - By means of the diffusion test, the range of action of the ampicillin successive  preparation spectacillin was determined using 12 000 pathological germs freshly isolated from in-patients. The result was a range of action similar to that of ampicillin. A comparison, however, is only possible in case the test platelets (without over-dosage) are each charged with exactly, e.g., 25 gamma. The analyses of serum concentrations have shown that spectacillin is satisfactorily absorbed after oral as well as after parenteral application. Thus, the calculation of the accumulated area of infinity beneath the serum concentration curve had the following results: After single intravenous injection of 1 g spectacillin (n equals 12) 51.46 gamma/ml - h; after single intravenous injection of 2 g spectacillin 86.20 gamma/ml - h; after intramuscular injection (twice) - interval of 12 hours - 29.94 gamma/ml - h after 12 hours; same values as before, but after 24 hours, 29.37 gamma/ml - h. After a single oral application of one capsule of spectacillin (capsule equals 500 mg), the value of the accumulated area was 8.46 gamma/ml - h. In analogy of the good absorption, excretion in urine/24 hrs (after application of 1 g spectacillin intravenously) was 61.74 p.c., after 2 g i.v. 54.30 p.c., and after applying twice 1 g spectacillin intramuscularly 61.40 p.c.; after oral application of 500 mg, the percentage was 28.42. Tolerance of spectacillin was good after oral as well as after parenteral application. No side effects were observed.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae to BL-S640, a new oral  cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BL-S640, a 7-(2-aryl-2-aminoacetamido)-3-(heterocyclic-thiomethyl) cephalosporin, was evaluated against 338 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in comparison with ampicillin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. Against Escherichia coli, BL-S640 was as active as cefazolin and more active than ampicillin, cephalothin, and cephalexin. BL-S640 was as effective as the other cephalosporins tested and far more active than ampicillin against Klebsiella and was more active than cephalexin against Proteus mirabilis and the indole-positive Proteus. The majority of Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter were resistant to ampicillin and all the cephalosporins tested. With rare exceptions, the zone of inhibition by the BL-S640 30-mug disk was either larger or the same as the zone obtained by the cephalothin 30-mug disk in the Kirby-Bauer disk susceptibility test.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from patients at National Taiwan University Hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. Cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria except Enterococci. Staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. More than 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. The relative potency of cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. The gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. Among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative pathogens tested. The relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against E. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. One hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. The sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. Very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.
TI  - Aminopenicillins - clinical pharmacology and use in disease states.
AB  - Ampicillin introduced in 1961 has been administered in the treatment of diverse infections by both oral and parenteral means. Oral infections of the upper airways such as otitis media, bronchitis, and pneumonia have responded with high success rates since the microorganisms involved have remained sensitive to ampicillin. Similarly, out-patient urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and enterococci are cured. Typhoid fever may yet be treated with ampicillin, but shigellosis has become refractory with the development of resistant strains. Ampicillin has assumed a prominent role in the treatment of gonorrhoea. Parenteral ampicillin is still a mainstay of the treatment of Hemophilus meningitis, but the recent appearance of ampicillin resistant strains may become a serious problem. A number of derivatives and analogues of ampicillin have been developed. Among the compounds, hetacillin, metampicillin and pivampicillin which hydrolyze in the body to yield ampicillin, only pivampicillin appears to offer advantage over the parent compound. Blood levels are twice those of a comparable dose of ampicillin. However, more comparisons with ampicillin in clinical situations are needed. The other analogues of ampicillin are epicillin, cyclacillin and amoxicillin. Epicillin has no superiority to ampicillin, and the cyclacillin data do not show clear superiority over ampicillin in spite of initially high blood levels, since the compound is less active and so rapidly cleared from the body. Amoxicillin, on the other hand, has been shown to have it vitro activity equal to ampicillin and to produce higher blood levels for a longer period of time. Clinical studies have substantiated efficacy in treatment of otitis media, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis, and urinary tract infections at doses half those of ampicillin. It has been effective in gonorrhoea and typhoid, but not in shigellosis. It would seem that to date only pivampicillin and amoxicillin, particularly the later, should be considered as replacements of ampicillin in oral therapy.
TI  - [Aminopenicillins from microbiological viewpoint].
AB  - In this report it was tried to emphasize several microbiological aspects of the amino-penicillin. Hereby it turns out that the activity differences of all the substances are very similar on microbiological part. A break of the cross-resistance does not happen with all the amino-penicillins. With regard to the appearance of resistant strains, it can be told that the conditions still are advantageous on non-hospitalized patients in the totality. In the clinic a high part of resistant strains are found on different grounds.
TI  - Determining antibiotic levels in the blood.
AB  - Methods for the rapid determination of antibiotic blood levels require particular organisms or special conditions or long incubation. A method was developed for the rapid determination of antibiotic blood levels which requires no special equipment and is rapid. Special stains are not required. Utilizing bacteria from standard Kirby-Bauer sensitivity plates, a suspension is prepared and a pour plate made. Organisms which are sensitive to the questioned antibiotic and resistant to other antibiotics the patient is receiving are chosen. Muller-Hinton is the best general agar. Wells are cut, and antibiotic standards, antibiotic controls, and the patient's serum introduced. Within three to four hours, zone sizes can be read and the antibiotic blood level calculated. The materials and technical facility required should not preclude any laboratory from successfully performing the method.

TI  - Pigment production by Bacteroides species with reference to sub-classification.
AB  - All six reference strains of Bacteroides species, 36 laboratory isolates conforming to this group, and individual strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Clostridum welchii produced a dense black pigment, identified as ferrus sulphide, when grown in cooked-meat media containing cystine and ferrous sulphate. This was an indicator effect resulting from the production of H2S by the bacteria in the presence of ferrous ions and was unrelated to the characteristic pigment produced by strains of B. melaninogenicus when grown on blood agar. A pigment was extracted by ultrasonic disintegration of washed cells of three reference strains of B. melanino-genicus grown for 1 week in horse-blood broth and on human-blood agar. It was intracellular or cell-associated, soluble in water and had the spectrophotometric characteristics of a derivative of haemoglobin. No such pigment was extracted from strains of B. fragilis or B. necrophorus by similar procedures. Pigment production is a stable characteristic of those strains of Bacteroides called B. melaninogenicus and it is a significant property in the classification of the Bacteroides group. However, the pigment-producing strains are not a homogenous species, and there were considerable differences between the results of biochemical tests and antibograms obtained with the three strains of B. melaninogenicus.

TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in schoolchildren in Newcastle upon Tyne.
AB  - A screening survey for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in Newcastle upon Tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1.9%. In girls 4 to 6 years it was 1.4%, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2.5%, in girls aged 12 to 18 years it was 1.6%, a statistically significant rise and fall. Renal scarring was found in 39 (15%) of 254 girls with ASB. Neither the prevalence nor the severity of renal scarring increased with age. There was no association between ASB and social class. Of the 254 girls with ASB, 24% had no symptoms. Infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with Esch. coli. The prevalence of ASB in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18 was low, 0.2%. Ureteric reflux was present in 15% of girls without renal scarring and in 46% of those with renal scarring (P less than 0.001). Renal scarring also showed a significant association with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. The greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. This study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. It therefore does not support the recommendation for prescriptive screening of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of ASB.

TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Computer surveillance of shifts in the gross patient flora during hospitalization.
AB  - Data accumulating routinely in a hospital microbiology laboratory were computer-plotted according to the number of days the patient had been in the hospital when each culture was obtained. The rate at which patients were cultured fell slightly during hospitalization, while the rate at which isolates were obtained from them increased gradually. For some species, such as Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, isolation rates changed little during hospitalization. They rose as much as sevenfold for other species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Serratia marcescens, or for a particular antibiotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae while it was an endemic nosocomial problem. These differences persisted after deletion of repeat isolates from the same patient. They appeared to reflect general shifts in composition of patient flora during hospitalization. These shifts paralleled shifts in infecting flora as represented by similar plots of isolates from blood cultures.
TI  - The role of vaginal colonization with enterobacteriaceae in recurrent urinary infections.
AB  - Quantitative cultures of the vaginal introitus for Enterobacteriaceae, S. faecalis and P. aeruginosa were compared in 20 premenopausal normal women (200 cultures) to 198 consecutive cultures from 9 premenopausal women in between episodes of bacteriuria. Introital colonization in patients susceptible to urinary infections was significantly higher for E. coli (p equals 0.001), S. faecalis (p equals 0.001) and for the presence of any gram-negative pathogens (p equals less than 0.001). In addition, introital colonization with these bacteria occurred in larger numbers and persisted through consecutive cultures for longer periods in women with recurrent infections.
TI  - Assay of deoxyribonucleic acid homology using a single-strand-specific nuclease at 75 C.
AB  - We investigated the conditions under which a crude preparation of endonuclease S1 gives maximal hydrolysis of denatured deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while giving minimal hydrolysis of native DNA. The hydrolysis was measured by filtering and determining the acid-insoluble reaction product using 3H-labeled substrates. We also investigated various parameters in making this measurement. Under appropriate conditions (in 1 mM ZnSO-4, 0.168 M NaCl at pH 4.8) denatured DNA is hydrolyzed within 3% of completion whereas native DNA is essentially unaffected. The reaction was applied to assay plasmid DNA homoand heteroduplexes for which the method proves to be simple, fast, and reproducible.
TI  - In vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
TI  - [A bacteriological study of otitis in dogs (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; Escherichia coli from 10; Proteus mirabilis from 20; Enterobacter sp. from 18 and Klepsiella sp. from 7. Mixed cultures of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter sp. in 5; Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis in 4. Enterobacter sp. and Klepsiella sp. in 2 and Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in 6. Theses results indicated that Staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (23%) and Klepsiella sp. (16%). Drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.

TI  - Potent combinations of beta-lactam antibiotics using the beta-lactamase inhibition principle.
AB  - Several penicillins known to be stable to enterobacterial beta-lactamases were tested in combination with beta-lactamase-sensitive penicillins and cephalosporins in a turbidimetric system. Nafcillin was found to be the best beta-lactamase inhibitor amongst agents presently available commercially, but the related, new semi-synthetic penicillin BRL 1437 (2-isopropoxy-1-naphthylpenicillin) was consistently found to be superior. Using 103 ampicillin-resistant coliform bacilli and antibiotic levels achievable in urine, cephalothin or cephaloridine alone achieved long-term suppression of growth (greater than 20 h) of 16 and 13% of strains, respectively, while the additional presence of BRL 1437 suppressed growth for longer than 20 h of 81% of the remaining strains. Even where 'success' was not achieved according to these stringent criteria, regrowth was significantly delayed by the presence of BRL 1437. Suppression of growth for longer than 20 h by BRL 1437 plus cephalothin was achieved with all of the 46 Escherichia coli strains tested. Antibiotic combinations were also studied in an in vitro model which stimulates the hydrokinetic features of the urinary bladder. Suppression of the growth of two highly resistant E. coli strains was achieved in this system, for therapeutically acceptable periods of time, with combinations of cephalothin or cephaloridine with BRL 1437, but not nafcillin.

AB  - The antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. Healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. Cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. Cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. The strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus faecalis. Use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. The use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms, with the exception of M. lysodeicticus. The maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.
TI  - Nation-wide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer. Analysis of 200.000 strains of problem bacteria isolated in 1973.
AB  - Based on a pilot study performed in 5 District Public Health Laboratories (PHL) in the Slovakia in 1972 (1), the computer system for elaborating the informations concerning the resistance of "problem bacteria" to antibiotics has completely been introduced in 18 PHLs for all-year studies on the resistance to antibiotics in 1973. The results obtained in each PHL and also in total of about 200.000 bacterial strains belonging to 8 of the clinically most important bacterial species were passed on to the corresponding PHL and to the health authorities twice a year. Each PHL elaborated these data being useful and instructive for general practitioners and clinicians in the hospitals of their districts to a commented information on the actual state of effectiveness of individual antibacterial drugs. The multiple spectra of resistance to antibiotics indicating the occurrence of R plasmids in clinical isolates of bacteria and the dynamics for the development of resistance against certain specially monitored "reserved antibiotics" are elaborated at present and will be published in a subsequent communication...
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activities of BB-K8 and three other aminoglycosides against 215 strains of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae with variable sensitivity to kanamycin and gentamicin.
AB  - 215 gram-negative bacilli isolated from clinical materials were tested in vitro against BB-K8 by means of disc diffusion and agar dilution tests; the strains included 40 isolates resistant to gentamicin. Approximately 90% of the strains were inhibited by 3.12 mug/ml or less BB-K8. This antibiotic exhibited a comparable activity, although somewhat inferior, to that of gentamicin, against organisms sensitive to gentamicin. It was considrably more active than gentamicin, and comparable to tobramycin, against the isolates of Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia spp. resistant to gentamicin, but less active than tobramycin against 11 strains of Pseudomonas resistant to gentamicin.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa R factors determining gentamicin plus carbenicillin resistance from patients with urinary tract colonizations.
AB  - R factors determining multiple resistance including both gentamicin and carbenicillin have been identified in high incidence among hospital isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  - Qualitative assessment of midstream urine cultures in the detection of bacteriuria.
AB  - 3550 women attending cervical smear and family planning clinics have been screened for bacteriria. Suprapubic aspiration of urine was carried out in 131 patients from whom two consecutive midstream urine specimens contained either a pure growth of Gram positive cocci or a growth in which Gram negative bacilli predominated. 95 patients were found to have bacteriuria; in 93 the urine was infected with a Gram negative organism. Of 53 patients with a count of more than 10-5 Gram negative organisms per milliliter on two consecutive midstream urine samples, 48 (91%) had bacteriuria. However, 45 (48%) of the 93 patients with bacteriuria did not have two consecutive counts greater than 10-5 organisms per milliliter , and 10 (11%) had counts of less than 10-4 organisms per milliliter in at least one of the two midstream urine samples. It is concluded that midstream urine counts of less than 10-5 organisms per milliliter in which Gram negative bacilli predominate may be indicative of bacteriuria and should be confirmed by suprapubic aspiration.
TI  - [Synthetic medium for testing of susceptibility. II. Susceptibility of bacteria to sulphonamides (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study of 9 media for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to 7 sulphonamides has been carried out. The evaluated culture-media included 4 "Mueller Hinton" media (MH), 4 others based on the formula of the "Diagnostic Sensitivity Test" agar base (D.S.T.) and a "Synthetic Medium" (SM) which has been developed in our laboratory. MH and D.S.T. culture-media have been supplied by 4 manufacturing companies in Europe and USA. A total number of 21 bacterial cultures have been employed. The included species belong to the gram negative genera Citrobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia and Shigella, and to the gram positive genus Streptococcus. Sulphafurazole, sulphasomidine, sulphamethoxazole, sulphamethoxypyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, sulphaphenazole and sulphamethoxydiazine have been investigated. SM proved to be clearly superior to the other 8 culture-media mentioned above. Just one MH afforded good results. The 3 other MH and 2 D.S.T. media were not quite satisfactory. The two remaining D.S.T. media were unsuitable. Moreover, the activity of the tested sulphonamides was not equally high against the concerned bacteria. The author discussed the significance of the inoculum-size and of competitive and noncompetitive sulphonamide-antagonists in commercial culture-media and the difficulties they raise by the interpretation of the results.

TI  - Molecular nature of the deoxyribonucleic acid of a thermosensitive R factor, Rts1.
AB  - The deoxyribonucleic acid of the thermosensitive R factor, Rts1, has been examined by the technique of sedimentation in alkaline sucrose, electron microscopy, and radiation target size. All these methods yielded a molecular weight of approximately 120 million for Rts1 deoxyribonucleic acid in Escherichia coli. Sedimentation analysis revealed that Rts1 deoxyribonucleic acid in Proteus mirabilis was also 120 million daltons. Rts1 did not segregate into E. coli minicells under the conditions where another smaller non-thermosensitive R factor could.
TI  - R-factor mutant capable of specifying hypersynthesis of penicillinase.
AB  - The physical characteristics of a mutant, R(M201-2), capable of conferring high and stable ampicillion resistance was analyzed. The R(M201-2) and its parent R-factor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) could be isolated as an extrachromosomal and covalently closed circular form. Their buoyant densities were both 1.712 g/cm(3), and their molecular weights were about 82 x 10(6) and 64 x 10(6), respectively, when measured by CsCl and sucrose density gradient analyses. The contour lengths by electron microscopy were 35.9 +/- 0.6 and 31.0 +/- 0.6 mum, respectively. By using the extracted R-factor DNA, the mutant and parent characters were transformable to another Escherichia coli strain. The mutant R factor showed an increased amount of DNA even after conjugal transfer to Proteus. An increase in the size of R-factor DNA was thus considered to be the cause of the high level of ampicillin resistance.
TI  - In vitro studies with cefazolin.
AB  - Susceptibilities of 259 isolates of pathogenic bacteria to cefazolin were measured by broth and agar dilution procedures. Beta-hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 0.25 mug/ml, whereas Staphylococcus aureus and alphahemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 2.0 mug/ml. Enterococci were resistant to less than 32 mug/ml. Wide variation was seen with gram-negative species. Most isolates of Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 4.0 or 8.0 mug/ml. Escherichia coli were less susceptible, and most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia species, and Enterobacter species were resistant to 128 mug/ml.
TI  - Properties of R factors from Bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  - Genetic properties and host ranges of R factors derived from Bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. All of 61 R factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. All of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, P1, P2, T1, T3, T6, T7, W31, and BF-23. They could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. An Rte16, a representative R factor, was incompatible with both RP4 and R40a, which are classified as compatibility groups P and C, respectively. An Rte16 was conjugally transmissible to B. bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, but not to Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  - Existence of a free form of a specific membrane lipoprotein in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The existence of a free form of a specific lipoprotein of molecular weight 7,200  was examined in the envelopes of several gram-negative bacteria. When the envelope proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, distinct peaks were observed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same position as the free form of the lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. However, the peak was not observed in Proteus mirabilis. The protein at the peak in S. typhimurium was shown to contain little or no histidine as expected from the amino acid composition of the lipoprotein. Furthermore, antiserum against the highly purified lipoprotein from E. coli was shown to react with the proteins from S. typhimurium and S. marcescens and to form the specific immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the protein from P. aeruginosa did not react with the antiserum at all. Thus, it is concluded that S. typhimurium and S. marcescens have the free form of the lipoprotein in their envelopes as does E. coli. P. aeruginosa contains a protein of the same size as the lipoprotein, but it is not certain whether the protein is the same structural protein as the lipoprotein from E. coli. P. mirabilis may not have any free form of the lipoprotein, may have it in a very small amount, or may have a lipoprotein of different molecular weight serving the same function.
TI  - Genetic and biophysical study of R plasmids conferring sulfonamide resistance in  Shigella strains isolated in 1952 and 1956.
AB  - The conjugative plasmids determining sulfonamide resistance in five Shigella strains, each isolated from a different patient, have been characterized. One S. flexneri 2a strain, isolated in 1952, harbored an fi(+) plasmid of molecular weight 53 x 10(6), which specified synthesis of F-like pili and bore determinants for sulfonamide resistance (Su) and bacteriocinogeny (Col). This plasmid was compatible with plasmids of groups F(I), F(II), I(alpha), and P. A second S. flexneri 2a strain isolated in 1952 harbored an fi(-) plasmid of molecular weight 59 x 10(6), bearing the Su determinant and compatible with all plasmids tested. This strain also harbored an fi(+) group-F(II) plasmid of molecular weight 42 x 10(6), which bore the Col determinant and specified synthesis of F-like pili. Three S. dysenteriae 2 strains isolated in 1956 carried apparently identical fi(-) plasmids of molecular weight 58 x 10(6), which bore the Su determinant, could form transconjugants in Pseudomonas but not in Proteus, and were incompatible with the P-group plasmid RP4.

AB  - Growth of Proteus mirabilis harboring R100-1 (fi(+)drd str(r)cml(r)tet(r)sul(r))  factors in Penassay broth containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) leads to the loss of all or part of the genetic elements in high frequencies. In media containing SDS at concentrations as low as 0.03%, both lysis of R(+) cells and elimination of the R factors occur at high frequencies. Appearance of drug-susceptible cells in R(+) cultures occurs during the exponential phase of growth; however, the frequencies of susceptible cells increase substantially after the culture reaches the stationary phase. Reconstruction experiments, coupled with other observations, suggest that the major factor in altering the frequency of drug-susceptible variants is the greater resistance of the variants to the lytic action of SDS. This resistance correlates in most cases with the loss of the transfer functions in the resistance transfer factor.

AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cinoxacin, 1-ethyl-4(1H)-oxo-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]cinnoline-3-carboxylic acid, previously reported as compound 64716, was determined and compared with other antimicrobial agents at a dosage of 12 mg/kg once daily in a descending pyelonephritis rat model with Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis as infecting organisms. Cinoxacin was considerably more effective than either nalidixic acid or oxolinic acid when all three were administered orally at 3 mg/kg four times daily. The presence of demonstrable serum activity with a high recovery in urine indicates cinoxacin possesses highly desirable properties of an effective oral chemotherapeutic agent for urinary tract infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
TI  - Treatment of pneumonia and other serious bacterial infections with cephapirin.
AB  - Nineteen patients with pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus  aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli were treated with 4 to 18 g of cephapirin daily. There were three treatment failures. One patient each with pneumonia due to E. coli or S. pneumoniae died despite apparent eradication of the pathogen. Lobar pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae progressed during therapy in a third patient to lung gangrene, necessitating pneumonectomy. Five additional patients with pneumococcal pericarditis or septic bursitis, empyema, cannula-associated bacteremia, and thoractomy wound infection due to S. aureus were cured. All isolates of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and group A Streptococcus were inhibited by 0.8 mug of cephapirin per ml; minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin were similar. Ninety percent of K. pneumoniae, 85% of Proteus mirabilis, 73% of E. coli, and 30% of Enterobacter were inhibited by 12.5 mug cephapirin per ml. All isolates of Pseudomonas, Serratia and indole-positive Proteus had a cephapirin minimal inhibitory concentration of [Formula: see text] 100 mug/mg. Serum concentrations after intravenous and intramuscular injection were similar to those reported for cephalothin. The intramuscular injections were moderately painful, and intravenous infusions caused phlebitis in three of nine patients treated with doses up to 18 g per day. Cephapirin appears comparable to cephalothin in vitro and is an effective agent in treatment of infection due to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - New antimicrobial nitrofuran, trans-5-amino-3-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-delta2-1,2,4-oxadiazole: antimicrobial efficacy in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.
AB  - A new antimicrobial nitrofuran designated SQ 18,506 showed some therapeutic activity when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella flexneri, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Animals infected parenterally with Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Candida albicans, or topically with Trichophyton mentagrophytes, did not respond to therapy with the drug at the dosage levels used. The compound was as effective as metronidazole in the topical treatment of experimental trichomonal infections in mice and in guinea pigs and as effective as nystatin, candicidin, or a sulfanilamide-aminacrine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of a candidal vaginal infection in rats. The chemotherapeutic efficacy of SQ 18,506 in experimental vaginitis caused by Escherichia coli in the rat surpassed that shown by four commercial products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.

The pharyngeal bacterial flora of 68 healthy Golden Syrian hamsters was determined. A quantitative comparison between Streptococci and Escherichia, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter from 70 hamsters was made before and at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after oxacillin administration. Lung cultures were positive in 22 of 25 hamsters, yielding K pneumoniae type 1 most frequently. Lung histology from 25 hamsters revealed bronchopneumonia. Intestinal postmortem cultures of treated and untreated animals were similar. The importance of throat cultures in diagnosing pneumonia and the value of the hamster model to study the effect of other antibiotics on the temporary flora are demonstrated.

AB  - Several distinctive properties of PRD1, an icosahedral plasmid-dependent phage, are described. The drug-resistance plasmid-dependent host range of PRD1 extends beyond the P incompatibility group and includes gram-negative bacteria containing plasmids of incompatibility groups N and W. PRD1 phage will infect pseudomonads and Enterobacteriaceae containing either a P or W incompatibility group plasmid. PRD1 adsorbs to the cell wall of R(+) bacteria and thus its infectivity indicates cell wall alterations by these drug-resistance plasmid groups. PRD1 nucleic acid is duplex DNA with an estimated molecular weight of 24 x 10(6). The appearance of PRD1 in electron micrographs is suggestive of lipid content in addition to its buoyant density of 1.348 in CsCl and its sensitivity to chloroform. The latent period of PRD1 varies with the R(+) host bacterial strain used for growth of the phage.

TI  - Cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1H-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. Enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Cefamandole was very active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of Escherichia coli, 86% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of Proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. A number of Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Pseudomonas species were resistant. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. Similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. Resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
TI  - Cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: antibacterial spectrum and resistance to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefoxitin, 3-carbamolyloxymethyl-7-alpha-methoxy-7[2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboy xlic acid, was investigated. Activity against gram-positive organisms was less than that of cephalothin and cephloridine. It was highly active against gram-negative bacilli, with activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae equal to that of currently available cephalosporins. In addition, it was active against certain Enterobacter strains, Serratia marcescens, indole-positive Proteae and Herellea. The strains of these latter bacteria were strains susceptible to carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were resistant. Changes in pH, inoculum size, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the antibiotic. Cefoxitin was highly resistant to hydrolysis by various types of gram-negative beta-lactamases. The precise role of resistance to beta-lactamase hydrolysis varied from strain to strain. Bacterial resistance to cefoxitin was not necessarily related to hydrolysis of the antibiotic. However, the resistance of cefoxitin to hydrolysis did contribute to its activity. Cefoxitin could function as an inducer of beta-lactamase activity and effectively bound to purified beta-lactamases.

AB  - The enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases, all of them R-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. Four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of -0.1 cm/h. Eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. The remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (-0.1 cm/h). All the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. The two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.

TI  - R-mediated beta-lactamases and episomal resistance to the beta-lactam drugs in different bacterial hosts.
AB  - Ten penicillinase plasmids of varying taxonomic origin were studied after transfer to a variety of bacterial hosts. Nine of the ten plasmids specified enzymes with the following identical, or very similar, properties: substrate profile, molecular weight, susceptibility to heat and inhibitors, and electrophoretic mobility, i.e., TEM-like enzymes. The tenth R-mediated beta-lactamase was a cephalosporinase. Plasmids with TEM-like enzymes mediated resistance patterns identical towards the beta-lactam drugs, whereas the resistance pattern of the cephalosporinase plasmid was distinctly different. Expression of enzyme and resistance had a dual R-factor and host specificity. Escherichia coli K-12 and Salmonella typhi constituted one group of the same R-factor phenotype expressions. Most, but not all, penicillinase plasmids exhibited in Proteus PM1 a considerably lower order of beta-lactamase activity and an even lower order of resistance to the beta-lactam drugs than the previous two hosts. This difference was most pronounced for the resistance to carbenicillin, which was mediated by the plasmids specifying the synthesis of TEM-like enzymes. Release by osmotic shock was complete in the host E. coli K-12 for the TEM-like enzymes, but was lower for the cephalosporinase and minimal or negative in the PM1 host. Crypticity factor for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin was not related to the increase in resistance mediated by the penicillinase plasmids in both K-12 and PM1 hosts. Inoculum size effects for the penicillins and 6-aminopenicillanic acid were higher in PM1 than in K-12 R(+) cultures. The expression of penicillinase plasmids in wild-type bacteria was strain specific and not species specific. For two plasmids of different phenotypes for beta-lactamase activity (and resistance) in K-12 and PM1 hosts, a positive correlation was found between their phenotype and the relative amount of episomal deoxyribonucleic acid, as detected by ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation. This is interpreted as indicating differences in the mode of replication of the plasmids in the two hosts.

After 6 h of incubation at 37 C, the membrane was transferred to antibiotic-free Mueller-Hinton agar containing triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride and incubated for 18 h at 37 C. Specific growth patterns were indicative of additive (indifferent), synergistic, or antagonistic effects of the drug combination used. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole proved to act synergistically against 85% of Escherichia coli, 86% of Klebsiella, and 89% of Proteus mirabilis strains tested. A few strains resistant to either drug were susceptible to their combination. The technique was useful against organisms with widely differing susceptibilities to the two antimicrobial agents tested.

TI  - Round of replication mutant of a drug resistance factor.
AB  - A derivative of the R factor NR1 (called R12) has been isolated which undergoes an increased number of rounds of replication each division cycle in Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. The alteration resulting in the increased number of copies (round of replication mutation) is associated with the transfer factor component of the R factor. R12 has the same drug resistance pattern as NR1, is the same size as shown by sedimentation in a sucrose gradient and electron microscopy (63 x 10(6) daltons), and has the same partial denaturation map. The level of the R factor gene product chloramphenicol acetyltransferase has been examined in P. mirabilis and was found to be consistent with gene dosage effects. The plasmid to chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid ratio of NR1 increases several fold after entry into stationary phase, whereas this ratio for R12 remains approximately constant. Individual copies of R12 are selected at random for replication from a multicopy plasmid pool. A smaller percentage of R12 copies replicate during amino acid starvation than has previously been found for NR1 in similar experiments.
TI  - Alternate forms of the resistance factor R1 in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The resistance factor R1 may exist in either of two stable physical states in Proteus mirabilis PM-1. In one case, the R1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has a buoyant density of 1.711 g/cm(3) and replicates under stringent control. Cells harboring R1 in this form may transfer drug resistance by conjugation. In the other case, R1 DNA shows two buoyant density classes at 1.707 and 1.714 g/cm(3). The 1.714 g/cm(3) component is replicated under a degree of relaxed control, and strains carrying this form generally cannot transfer drug resistance by conjugation. Intracellular amounts of the R factor-coded enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, did not correspond to amounts of plasmid DNA in Proteus, and the enzyme was present in lower amounts than in Escherichia coli. It is proposed that the two states of R1 in Proteus may represent stable associated and dissociated forms of the plasmid.

AB  - A simple method for detecting bacteria, based on the time of hydrogen evolution,  was developed and tested against various members of the Enterobacteriaceae group. The test system consisted of (i) two electrodes, platinum and a reference electrode, (ii) a buffer amplifier, and (iii) a strip-chart recorder. Hydrogen evolution was measured by an increase in voltage in the negative (cathodic) direction and recorded on a strip-chart recorder. Hydrogen response curves consisted of (i) a lag period, (ii) a period of rapid buildup in potential due to hydrogen, and (iii) a period of decline in potential. A linear relationship was established between inoculum size and the time hydrogen was detected (lag period). Lag times ranged from 1 h for 10(6) cells/ml to 7 h for 10(0) cells/ml. For each 10-fold decrease in inoculum, length of the lag period increased 60 to 70 min. Mean cell concentrations at the time of hydrogen evolution were 10(6)/ml. Based on the linear relationship between inoculum size and lag period, these results indicate the potential application of the hydrogen-sensing method for rapidly detecting coliforms and other gas-producing microorganisms in a variety of clinical, food, and other samples.

AB  - This paper reports our experience in monitoring gentamicin therapy during the treatment of 68 episodes of serious Gram-negative sepsis in 65 hospital patients. Most of the patients had major underlying disease. Of those who were adequately treated (peak serum concentrations of 5 mug/ml or more in 72 hours for septicaemia, urinary tract infection, and wound infection; and 8 mug/ml or more at some time during the course of treatment for pneumonia) 84% (46 out of 55) were cured. These serum concentrations could be achieved only by starting with a regimen of 5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses in all adult patients, subsequent dosage being determined by the results of rapid serum assay. The incidence of nephrotoxicity and symptomatic ototoxicity was no greater than in previous series. The main reason for assaying serum gentamicin is to ensure that an adequate dosage is achieved as soon as possible. In patients with impaired renal function or receiving prolonged high dosage assays also serve to guard against an excessive accumulation of gentamicin and an increased risk of toxicity.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of cephacetrile with cephalothin-cephaloridine.
AB  - Under double-blind protocol, a controlled comparison was made between a new cephalosporin, cephacetrile, and cephalothin or cephaloridine. The patient's primary physician determined the indications for treatment, and the dosage was uniform for each route of administration. Infecting strains of staphylococci and Proteus mirabilis had a lower median inhibitory concentration for cephalothin than cephacetrile; the opposite was true for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. The average peak serum level 1 h after a dose of 2 g intravenously was 74.9 +/- 21 and 21.5 +/- 8.7 mug/ml for cephacetrile and cephalothin, respectively; 6 h after the dose, the respective levels were 12.4 +/- 4.3 and 3.7 +/- 0.9 mug/ml. Renal clearances were similar and the plasma clearance was proportional to the serum levels. In the urine, the concentration of cephacetrile was three times higher than that of cephalothin. Based on a percentage of therapeutic potential, success in the treatment of infections with susceptible organisms was 42 and 44% for the two different drug regimens. Initial bacterial resistance was found in about one-fifth of infections, and concomitant therapy with other drugs was practiced in one-half of the treatment courses. Intravenous use of cephacetrile was discontinued prematurely more often than was use of cephalothin, suggesting less tolerance. Although there was no overt toxicity, more than 75% of patients on either regimen had some form of unwanted response to treatment, the most common being superinfection. From this limited but controlled experience, cephacetrile can be considered comparable to cephalothin in antimicrobial treatment and overall side reactions.
TI  - Relation of R factor and chromosomal beta-lactamase with the periplasmic space.
AB  - The release of several R factor and chromosomal beta-lactamases by osmotic shock  treatment was studied. It was found that those beta-lactamases with a molecular weight of about 20,000 were released, but those with a molecular weight of about 30,000 to 44,000 were not released during osmotic shock. This differential release did not depend on whether the structural genes were on the chromosome or on the genome of an R factor. The release or retention of the beta-lactamases appeared to be a characteristic of the enzyme rather than the host cell since the same results were obtained when the R factors were harbored by a variety of host bacteria. Studies with bacteria which produced more than one beta-lactamase showed that each enzyme reacted independently to the presence of other beta-lactamases produced by the host bacterium.
TI  - Fractionation of DNA on hydroxyapatite with a base-specific complexing agent.
AB  - We describe a chromatographic technique for separating mixtures of DNA of varying G + C content. The method employs a specially prepared high-capacity hydroxyapatite and a G.C-specific DNA ligand (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethylamino-5-phenyl-phenazinium cation, abbreviated PNR). DNA molecules rich in G.C pairs bind larger amounts of this dye and are eluted earlier from the hydroxyapatite column than are molecules rich in A.T pairs. The dye can easily be removed from DNA by dialysis or solvent extraction after the chromatographic separation. The resolution of the method approaches that of CsCl density gradient separation, and the capacity of the column is much larger than that of a typical density gradient experiment. Elution of the DNA is not dependent on molecular weight, so samples of different molecular weight can be separated on the basis of G + C content. The technique should be especially useful for separating G.C-rich minor components from DNA obtained form eukaryotic cells, as demonstrated by a fraction of DNA from calf thymus.

AB  - The effect of inhibition of protein synthesis on the replication of the R factor  Rts1 in Proteus mirabilis was examined by using the technique of CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Only 12% of the copies of Rts1 were found to replicate during amino acid starvation, whereas there was a 30% increase in the amount of P. mirabilis chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during the same period. Essentially the same amount of Rts1 and host chromosome replication was observed when chloramphenicol was used to inhibit protein synthesis. The replication of Rts1 DNA was also examined in experiments in which cultures were starved for amino acids in (14)N-labeled medium and then transferred to (15)N-labeled medium containing the required amino acids. These experiments showed that Rts1 replication took place throughout the first generation in (15)N-labeled medium and that each copy of Rts1 was replicated one time during the first generation of chromosomal DNA synthesis in (15)N-medium.

TI  - Cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: susceptibility studies.
AB  - Cefoxitin, 3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-alpha-methoxy-7-[2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid, is a new semisynthetic cephamycin with broad antibacterial activity. It is highly active against gram-negative microorganisms including indole-positive Proteus and Serratia strains, which are ordinarily reistant to the cephalosporins. Cefoxitin is also highly active against many strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis which are resistant to the cephalosporins. Furthermore, E. coli and Klebsiella strains which are susceptible to the cephalosporins are generally more susceptible to the cephamycin analog. The susceptibility of the gram-positive bacteria falls well within the effective range of the antibiotic for gram-negative organisms, but cefoxitin is less active than cephalothin or cephaloridine. As is the case with the cephalosporins, strains of Pseudomonas and group D streptococci are resistant to cefoxitin. Changes in pH, inoculum density, and growth medium have no significant effect on the activity of the antibiotic.

TI  - Factors affecting selectivity of brilliant green-phenol red agar for salmonellae.
AB  - Commercial brilliant green (BG)-sulfa agar was found to be nonselective toward a  test series of Enterobacteriaceae. Various formulations of BG were prepared by using Trypticase soy agar (BBL) as a base. Results were more reproducible when BG dye was added after sterilization than before. Sulfonamides improved selectivity as compared with brilliant green alone. Sulfanilamide (SN) was slightly more selective for salmonellae than other sulfonamides tested. Bile salts and sodium dodecyl sulfate markedly reduced the toxicity of BG to all the test bacteria. Enterobacter strains were most difficult to inhibit. A combination of 5 mg of BG and 1 g of SN/liter prevented growth of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli and retarded growth of Enterobacter strains. The BG-SN agars were superior in selectivity to a series of commercial agars tested, and numbers of salmonellae recovered on BG-SN agar and Trypticase soy agar (BBL) were the same. Brilliant green agars with various degrees of selectivity are described.

AB  - The activity of cefoxitin was compared with that of cephalothin against 229 bacterial strains. Cefoxitin was more active against most Gram-negative strains, notably against indole-producing Proteus spp., which are usually resistant to the cephalosporins. Cefoxitin was not susceptible to any significant extent to degradation by beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms. Against Gram-positive organisms, however, cefoxitin was considerably less active than cephalothin, but minimum inhibitory concentrations for Staphylococcus aureus were well within therapeutically attainable blood levels.Pharmacokinetic studies in 18 volunteers showed a higher and longer sustained antibiotic activity in serum and urine after injections of cefoxitin than after equal doses of cephalothin. Urinary recovery of cefoxitin activity was also much higher than that of cephalothin. No evidence of toxicity due to cefoxitin was found. Cefoxitin was slightly less painful after intramuscular injection than cephalothin.

Cefazolin was also tested in vitro and shown to be effective against staphylococci, pneumococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Proteus mirabilis by agar dilution method. It was shown to produce high serum levels when administered in a 250- to 1,000-mg intramuscular dose and was well tolerated and free from renal toxicity. Comparison of the results of this study with those from our prior studies on cephaloridine revealed equivalent antibiotic potency, good tolerance to both the agents when given intramuscularly, superior, average blood levels with cefazolin, equal clinical efficacy, and absence of renal toxicity with cefazolin (unlike cephaloridine). Similarly, the results of treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia with intramuscular cefazolin were found to be superior to those for oral cephalexin.

AB  - Merodiploid derivatives bearing an F-linked lac operon (i(+), o(+), z(+), y(+), a(+)) from Escherichia coli were prepared from a Proteus mirabilis strain unable to utilize lactose and from a lac deletion strain of E. coli. A suitable growth medium was found in which the episomal element in the P. mirabilis derivative was sufficiently stable to allow induction of the episome-borne lac operon and thus to permit a comparison of the activities and properties of E. coli lac products in the intracellular environments of P. mirabilis and E. coli. In both derivatives the episomal lac operon was shown to be repressed in the absence of inducer. Kinetics of induction with gratuitous inducer (isopropyl-1-thio-beta-d-galactoside) were similar for both beta-galactosidase activity (beta-d-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.4.1.23) and beta-galactoside transport activity in both derivatives, although the ratio of galactoside transport to beta-galactosidase activity was approximately 1.6-fold higher in the E. coli derivative. Comparison of beta-galactosidase and M-protein (lac y gene product)-specific activities indicated coordinate expression of the induced lac operon in both derivatives. Quantitatively, the maximal beta-galactosidase specific activity was two or three times higher for the E. coli derivative. A significant sodium azide inhibition (65% inhibition by 10 mM sodium azide) of lactose permease-mediated transport of o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside from an outside region of high concentration to an inside region of very low concentration ("downhill transport") was observed for the P. mirabilis derivative. Identical conditions for the E. coli derivative yielded only about 15% inhibition. Active transport of thiomethyl-beta-galactoside was similar for both derivatives, the major difference being that active transport was more sensitive to azide poisoning in the P. mirabilis derivative. Preliminary examination of the thiomethyl-beta-galactoside derivatives following active transport did not demonstrate the accumulation of a phosphorylated product in either strain but did reveal an unidentified derivative present in the P. mirabilis merodiploid extract which was not detectable in the E. coli merodiploid.

TI  - Comparative activity of amoxycillin and ampicillin in an experimental bacterial infection in mice.
AB  - Against experimental infections in mice with strains of Escherichia coli and with Proteus mirabilis, amoxycillin was found to be more active than ampicillin both by the oral and the subcutaneous routes of administration. With the bacteria used in these experiments, ampicillin and amoxycillin showed the same minimal inhibitory concentrations and, after subcutaneous administration, the levels of ampicillin and amoxycillin in the plasma and tissue homogenate were also similar. However, counts of the number of viable bacteria present in the infected tissue showed that amoxycillin exerted a more rapid and a more marked bactericidal effect than did ampicillin, and this could be correlated with the difference in therapeutic effect. When given by mouth, amoxycillin was more completely absorbed than ampicillin and gave rise to higher levels of antibiotic in the plasma. This may have accounted in part for the difference in therapeutic activity seen when these penicillins were given by the oral route. However, when appropriate oral dosages of ampicillin and amoxycillin were used so as to achieve similar levels of antibiotic in the plasma and tissue homogenate, amoxycillin was again found to exert a more marked bactericidal effect than did ampicillin, and this was accompanied by greater therapeutic activity. In experiments in vitro, amoxycillin also showed a more rapid bactericidal effect than did ampicillin against the bacteria which were used to produce the experimental infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of cephalothin and three penicillins against Escherichia coli and Proteus species.
AB  - The susceptibility of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (67) and Proteus species (58) to cephalothin, ampicillin, benzyl penicillin, and phenoxymethyl penicillin was determined in vitro by using broth dilution and disk diffusion tests. The data were correlated by using a four-category scheme for interpreting minimal inhibitory concentrations (groups 1 to 4) as recommended by a subcommittee of an international collaborative study of susceptibility testing. With cephalothin and ampicillin, groups 1 (susceptible) and 2 (moderately susceptible) were susceptible by the disk test, and with benzyl penicillin, similar results were observed when the interpretive zone standards were changed. Strains categorized as group 4 (very resistant) were resistant by the disk method, but group 3 (moderately resistant) strains were not adequately distinguished by disk testing. Group 3 susceptibility to benzyl and phenoxymethyl penicillins can be predicted by extrapolating results from tests with ampicillin disks.

Arizona were 70 to 80% related to salmonellae. Two groups of Arizona were detected. These groups correlated with the presence of monophasic or diphasic flagellar antigens. Salmonella and Arizona were no more related to Citrobacter than to Escherichia coli (45-55%). Relatedness of Salmonella and Arizona to other enterobacteria ranged from 20 to 40% with klebsiellae and shigellae, to 20 to 25% with erwiniae, and to less than 20% with edwardsiellae and Proteus mirabilis.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory evaluation of amoxicillin (BRL 2333) in the treatment of  urinary tract infections.
AB  - Amoxicillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a new oral semisynthetic  penicillin with antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin; however, it is more completely absorbed and urinary concentrations are higher. Twenty-seven patients during 28 episodes of urinary tract infection were treated with oral amoxicillin given either as 250- or 500-mg doses. Clinical cure or improvement occurred in 23 of 27 infections (85%); eradication of the responsible organisms occurred in 23 of 26 infections (88%); and both clinical cure or improvement and eradication occurred in 20 of 25 infections (80%). Three infections relapsed. Failure to respond bacteriologically was associated with resistant organisms in two patients and with chronic pyelonephritis (Proteus mirabilis) is one. Concentrations of amoxicillin in serum obtained 2 h after administration were more variable than those previously reported for reasons which were obscure. In vitro studies revealed amoxicillin to be comparable to ampicillin when tested against most gram-negative bacilli; however, in this situation amoxicillin may be more effective than ampicillin against enterococci.

TI  - Host cell growth in the presence of the thermosensitive drug resistance factor, Rts1.
AB  - We have confirmed and extended the observation of Terawaki et al. that the R factor, Rts1, alters the growth of its host at 42 C. In all media tested there was a period during which total cell numbers increased linearly, while viable counts remained constant. During this period the rate of precursor incorporation per cell particle into deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein declined steadily. These patterns were a consequence of the accumulation of increasing numbers of cells which had lost colony-forming ability. A temperature shiftdown experiment showed that the colony formers could, after a lag, go on to divide normally, whereas most of the noncolony formers could not undergo even a limited number of divisions after shiftdown. The number of normal divisions which occurred after shiftup of Rts1 cells to 42 C was medium dependent. In rich medium there were, on the average, two or three doublings; in glucose medium, one; and in glycerol medium, only a fraction of a doubling. Even in glucose medium, however, no increase in viable counts was observed during growth at 42 C if the cells were first starved for glucose for 1 h at 42 C. A temperature shiftdown from 42 C to 27 C during glucose starvation reversed the effect of starvation at 42 C alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the thermosensitive Rts1 component(s) responsible for the host effects is present at permissive temperature, but can undergo a reversible temperature-induced alteration which then interferes with some essential host function. The detrimental effects of this R factor on its host were also reflected in a heightened sensitivity to kanamycin and actinomycin D at 42 C. Electron microscope observations revealed changes in the appearance of the cell membrane. Membranous invaginations were noted at discrete sites in the cell.

AB  - The expression of R-factor-mediated resistance to tetracycline has been compared  in Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Resistance to a range of concentrations of tetracycline was significantly lower in P. mirabilis than in E. coli in both induced and repressed states. Indirect evidence showed that conditions which result in a marked increase in the level of resistance of P. mirabilis harboring the R factor NR1 to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and spectinomycin due to an amplification in the number of copies of r-determinants per cell do not detectably increase the level of resistance to tetracycline. Tetracycline resistance was inducible in early stationary-phase P. mirabilis NR1 although not after 5 h in this state. Double isotope labeling of control and tetracycline-induced P. mirabilis NR1 in early stationary phase revealed isotopic enrichment of certain peaks in extracts from induced cells subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

AB  - Heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii) anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). The lower the pH of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. The antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against P. aeruginosa than against three Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 M to 0.005 M) and at the 3 pH values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). As the pH value increased, the antibacterial activity decreased. Antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each pH value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pK(a) values. Lactic acid, with the lowest pK(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro at the pH of the mouse cecum. These results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by P. aeruginosa.

AB  - IgG with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to IgG antibacterial antibody preparations. Opsonic human IgG obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. Antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. In vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. Under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of I(-) and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. Potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and E. coli. However, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of P. aeruginosa. Bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated IgG preparations. Antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. These in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

In a second patient with partial ureteral obstruction, a resistant E. coli strain transferred ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin resistance to a Proteus mirabilis strain.
TI  - Abolition of swarming of Proteus by p-nitrophenyl glycerin: general properties.
AB  - Para-nitrophenyl glycerin (PNPG) was shown to be an effective agent to abolish the swarming of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris on predried solid culture media. The level required to abolish swarming varied with the strain of Proteus, the components of the medium, and also with the conditions of incubation. Generally 0.1 to 0.2 mM PNPG effectively abolished swarming for at least 24 h with aerobic incubation. Levels of PNPG that abolished swarming showed no effect upon the growth of the cells, little or no effect upon the motility characteristics of the organisms, and no effect upon the cellular morphology. PNPG was found to be freely water soluble, stable to autoclaving, and to retain biological activity for at least one month in prepared culture media stored under refrigeration.

AB  - Modified Moore's swabs, placed in sewers for 5 days, were used to concentrate salmonellas from sewage. Duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. respectively. Salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were incubated at 41 degrees C. However, when equal portions of the same swabs were incubated at 37 degrees C., only 22% of them yielded Salmonella organisms. These results indicate an advantage in incubating the selenite broths at 41 degrees C. rather than 37 degrees C. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage.One hundred and fifty faecal samples were examined for salmonellas by culture in selenite broths incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. Twelve (8%) samples were positive at 41 degrees C. compared to only 10 (6.7%) positive samples at 37 degrees C. This difference is not statistically significant to indicate an advantage of the elevated-temperature of incubation over the conventional temperature in attempting to isolate salmonellas from human faeces. Moreover, results of the recovery rates of S. paratyphi B, S. typhi, and S. typhimurium indicate that an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C. is more appropriate for recovering salmonellas from artificially infected faecal samples than an incubation temperature of 41 degrees C. This stresses the inability of laboratory studies to mimic conditions in nature.

AB  - The bacterial flora of excluded colonic segments of three patients has been examined in the normal resting state and following perfusion.The flora of the excluded colon was substantial and qualitatively similar to that of faeces. Perfusion for two hours at 10 ml per minute usually reduced counts of organisms present in the issuing effluent by 1 to 1(1/2) logs in two patients, but rises in the counts of some organisms were recorded from the third patient. Prolonged rapid perfusion or the inclusion of antibiotics in the perfusing solution was necessary to obtain a substantial reduction in counts.

AB  - Bacterial growth and the production of ammonia from urea and by deamination of peptone has been examined at various pHs in both conventional static bacterial cultures and in a continuous cultivation system. Growth occurred on primary testing of 93 out of 100 strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria at pH 5, and 48 out of 50 strains of Esch. coli at pH 4.6. Hydrolysis of urea by Proteus mirabilis decreased steadily from pH 7.2 to pH 5.3; below pH 5.3 little hydrolysis occurred. Ammonia production from peptones by Esch. coli decreased from pH 7.2 to pH 4.6. Considerable variation was noted in the ability of different strains to produce ammonia. Experiments with cultures containing both Esch. coli and Pr. mirabilis showed that more ammonia was produced at low pH than was produced by cultures of single organisms. At low pH reduction in the count of organisms was not found to be an essential prerequisite for reduction of ammonia formation.

TI  - Clinical and in vitro evaluation of cefazolin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. Cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Proteus mirabilis. Cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against Escherichia coli and slightly more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive Proteus species. After a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, group A streptococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of Proteus species other than P. mirabilis. All of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. There were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. Cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. Its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.

TI  - Amoxicillin, a new penicillin antibiotic.
AB  - Amoxicillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin, BRL 2333) is a new semisynthetic penicillin which is structurally similar to ampicillin, but which is better absorbed and yields higher concentrations in serum and urine. The in vitro susceptibility of 145 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 30 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined against various concentrations of amoxicillin and ampicillin in agar. In addition, inhibitory zones around discs containing 10 mug of amoxicillin were measured and compared with results of agar dilution studies. The drug also was evaluated in the treatment of 38 patients with bacteriuria, who received doses of either 750 mg or 1 g/day for 10 days. In vitro, amoxicillin was comparable in activity to ampicillin; most isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 10 mug or less/ml, whereas the majority of strains of Enterobacter, Klebsiella, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas grew in concentrations greater than 50 mug/ml. Clinically, amoxicillin was effective in eradicating bacteriuria due to susceptible organisms and was very well tolerated. For practical purposes, however, amoxicillin performed no better than a host of other drugs presently available for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated bacteriuria.

TI  - Murein and the outer penetration barrier of Escherichia coli K-12, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A penetration barrier operating outside the periplasmic enzyme penicillinase was  studied in an ampicillin-resistant mutant of Escherichia coli K-12. Growth in the presence of lysozyme and sublethal concentrations of ampicillin partially opened the barrier. This could be recorded as an increased penetration of penicillin G, sodium cholate, and rifampin to their respective targets. Brief treatments with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium cholate effectively impaired the barrier against penicillin and also caused leakage of penicillinase. Wild-type E. coli K-12, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa also showed an increased sensitivity to cholate after treatment with penicillins. Electron micrographs showed that lysis by cholate was due to a distortion of the cytoplasmic membrane causing a leakage of protein and RNA from the cells to the medium. Physiological data indicated that the increased sensitivity to cholate induced by growth in the presence of ampicillin or lysozyme was due to effects upon the murein. This was supported by measurement of the incorporation of (3)H-diaminopimelic acid. These results indicate that the murein sacculus either is a part of the penetration barrier or is responsible for holding the structure of the outer membrane together.

AB  - Cephamycins A, B, and C are naturally produced cephalosporin-type antibiotics. Although A and B were found to be more active than C against gram-positive organisms, they were not so active against such strains as are cephalosporin C or the semisynthetic antibiotics cephaloridine and cephalothin. Against gram-negative organisms, cephamycin C was more active than A or B and, in general, was as active as the cephalosporins. In addition, cephamycin C was active in vitro against clinically isolated strains resistant to the cephalosporins, such as Proteus, Providencia, and Escherichia coli. The in vitro antibacterial activity of cephamycin C, cephalothin, and cephaloridine is primarily bactericidal. A 10,000-fold increase in inoculum of a strain of Proteus mirabilis resulted in 200-fold or greater increases in minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal end points of cephalothin and cephaloridine, but only 10- and 16-fold increases, respectively, for cephamycin C. After 15 passages through antibiotic-containing broths, during which time a culture of E. coli showed an increase in minimal inhibitory concentrations of streptomycin of >1,000-fold, end points for cephamycin C increased 4-fold, for cephalothin, 1.5-to 6-fold, and for cephaloridine, 128-fold.
TI  - Activity of methacycline, related tetracyclines, and other antibiotics against various L-forms and their parent bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The activity of methacycline against microbial L-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. The L-forms and bacteria used were Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (three strains), Proteus mirabilis (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (two strains), Sarcina flava, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of S. flava was more susceptible than the L-form. In general, other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms. There were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more susceptible than the L-form. These included the effect of polymyxin B and colistin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and P. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. flava, and S. marcescens.

AB  - The effects of thymine limitation on the rates of growth, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and increase in viable cell number for a thymine auxotroph of Proteus mirabilis were investigated. At thymine concentrations of 1.0 mug/ml and below, these rates were markedly decreased. After a reduction in thymine concentration from 10 mug/ml to 0.2 mug/ml, mass synthesis continued at the preshift rate for several hours. In contrast, the rate of DNA synthesis immediately decreased, resulting in a decrease in the DNA to mass ratio to about one-half of its normal level. Viable counts remained constant for several hours after the reduction in thymine concentration, and enlarged cells and multicellular "snakes" were formed. The rate of DNA synthesis was reduced at thymine concentrations below approximately 1.7 mug/ml. The addition of thymine to cultures which had been completely starved for thymine increased the rate of DNA synthesis to at least twice its normal value; this suggests that extra rounds of chromosome replication can be induced in P. mirabilis as previously observed in Escherichia coli.

Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  - One hundred fifty-two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the Kirby-Bauer method. Tobramycin was most active against S. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. All strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and indole-positive Proteus species, and 80% of Enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. Tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against S. aureus, four times as active against P. aeruginosa, slightly more active against E. coli and Enterobacter species, equally active against P. mirabilis, and slightly less active against K. pneumoniae. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of P. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. Tobramycin sterilized cultures of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. Tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 C, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of nifuratel in urine and serum.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations of nifuratel for 205 randomly selected isolates from urinary tract infections were tested by tube dilution. Of these, 177 (86.3%) were resistant to more than 6 mug/ml and 140 of 141 (99.3%) strains of Escherichia coli were resistant to more than 3 mug/ml. Urine levels of nifuratel were examined in two groups: one group had 400 mg given once and the other group had 2 g given over 24 hours. In both groups samples of urine were collected every hour for seven hours after the last dose. After one 400-mg dose the maximum urine level achieved by any subject was 2.0 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 0.75 mug/ml. With the 2 g total dose, the maximum level noted was 4 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 1.8 mug/ml. No measurable inhibition was noted in any of the blood samples removed at one and a half to two hours after the last dose.

AB  - A mutant of the repressed R factor R1a and two mutants of the derepressed R factor R1drd-19 showing a two- to fourfold increase in resistance to all of the antibiotics to which the wild-type R factors mediate resistance were studied. The increased resistance was due to a two- to fourfold increase in the number of R-factor copies per chromosome. The production of drug-metabolizing enzymes was linearly correlated to the gene dosage. There was also a linear correlation between resistance to the drugs and the production of the corresponding enzymes. The mutations were also expressed in Proteus mirabilis PM1. In Proteus, R factors are split into two plasmids, resistance transfer factor and the resistance part. The mutation in one of the mutant R factors seems to be located in the resistance part. A second fi(+) R factor (R100) was introduced into strains already carrying R1drd-19 or the mutant R factor R1drd-19B2. In the first case, R100 and R1drd-19 segregated with equal probability when the bacteria were grown on antibiotic-free medium, whereas, in the second case, R100 was rapidly and preferentially excluded.

Its in vitro activity is quite similar to ampicillin, but it produces higher serum levels after oral administration. The mean peak serum levels of amoxicillin in 11 normal volunteers were 2.30 mug/ml after 125 mg, 3.43 mug/ml after 250 mg, 6.75 mug/ml after 500 mg, and 9.90 mug/ml after 1 g. About 70% of the drug was excreted in the urine during the first 6 hr.

Mapping of the structural genes of these factors was undertaken by a study of the gene products in genetically defined E. coli-P. mirabilis hybrid diploid strains. It was found that the EF G factor mapped within 5 min of the streptomycin resistance locus, but the EF Ts factor did not map in this region.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cephalosporin antibiotic, cephapirin.
AB  - Cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of Enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. At a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of Klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. However, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas were inhibited. A 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. All penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. The drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. Cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. Of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative culture during therapy. A single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis. Two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. The drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. No abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. In addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. If further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.

These changes included the emergence of a large proportion of kanamycin-resistant strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli and of smaller proportions of trimethoprim- and gentamicin-resistant strains; also the complete replacement of Proteus mirabilis with dissociated resistance to ampicillin by strains showing linked resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The probable relationship of these changes to the emergence of an R factor determining resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine in Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is discussed.

AB  - 7-[alpha-(1-Methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as BL-S 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. A comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that BL-S 217 is about eightfold more effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BL-S 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., BL-S 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against Salmonella and Enterobacter. Overall, of 208 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to BL-S 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. BL-S 217 was less bound to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. The LD(50) of BL-S 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. When administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in S. pyogenes and D. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an E. coli infection. Its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.

Cephapirin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against 25 strains each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus; 10 strains each of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas species, and Enterobacter species; and 8 strains of Proteus species other than P. mirabilis. All strains of S. aureus and D. pneumoniae and most strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus species were inhibited by concentrations of cephapirin achieved in the serum. Of 27 patients (20 with pneumonia, 2 with S. aureus empyema, and 5 with miscellaneous infections), 25 responded to cephapirin therapy. The only major toxicity thought to be drug-related occurred in a patient who developed reversible bone marrow depression with leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Although cephapirin was painful on intramuscular injection, phlebitis and pain were absent in patients treated intravenously. In a controlled comparison of intravenously administered cephalothin and cephapirin in four additional patients, the latter caused much less pain than the former and caused no phlebitis.

TI  - Molecular hybridization of ribonucleic acid with a large excess of deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - When RNA is annealed in solution with a sufficiently large excess of DNA, the kinetics of DNA-RNA hybridization are relatively simple. Methods are described for following the course of both DNA renaturation and DNA-RNA hybridization in this system. To explore the characteristics of the reaction a series of model systems was used. Each one utilized DNA (sheared to constant size) from a bacterium or bacteriophage and homologous cRNA, i.e. RNA synthesized in vitro on a template of the same DNA. Temperature optima were determined for the hybridization of Escherichia coli nucleic acids in 2xSSC and 3xSSC-50% formamide buffers, and of Proteus mirabilis nucleic acids in 2xSSC buffer. Rate-constants for DNA-RNA hybridization were measured by two methods. These gave somewhat different results, but in all cases the rate-constant of DNA-RNA hybridization was clearly less than that of DNA renaturation. Thus hybridization is a slower reaction than DNA renaturation. Nevertheless, in some cases, with a high concentration of DNA and a long annealing time, 90-95% of the added RNA became resistant to ribonuclease. Experiments are described which show that it is possible to deduce the analytical complexity of DNA with reasonable accuracy from its hybridization with complementary RNA. Similarly, it is possible to estimate the reiteration frequency of multiple DNA sequences (such as ribosomal DNA) from the hybridization of the total DNA with RNA complementary to the multiple sequences. The effect on the system of various DNA/RNA ratios from 100 to 1 is described.

AB  - A completely automated system for the performance of antibiotic susceptibility tests in the clinical laboratory is described. With a modicum of personnel involvement, data on 40 specimens tested against 13 antibiotics are obtained every hour after an initial 3-hr period. The step by step explanation of the functioning of this prototype system, based on a thoroughly tested manual model, is presented. The system compares well with the standard diffusion test and has a potential for application to other endeavors of the clinical microbiology laboratory with a comparable saving in time and labor.

TI  - Antibacterial nitroacridine, Nitroakridin 3582: effects on bacterial growth and macromolecular biosynthesis in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial drug Nitroakridin 3582 inhibited the growth of selected grampositive bacteria more strongly than it inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacilli. Nitroakridin at concentrations of the order of 5 x 10(-5)m induced lysis of Bacillus licheniformis and Micrococcus lysodeikticus. At concentrations less than 10(-4)m, Nitroakridin 3582 reduced the exponential growth rate of Escherichia coli C-2; at 10(-4)m the drug was bacteriostatic, and, at concentrations greater than 10(-4)m, it was bactericidal. Prolonged bacteriostasis resulted in the formation of long filaments by E. coli, Serratia marcescens, Shigella sonnei, and Proteus mirabilis. The reversible effects of Nitroakridin 3582 on the growth of E. coli correlated with partial inhibitions of deoxyribonucleic acid biosynthesis; ribonucleic acid and protein syntheses were inhibited less strongly. Nitroakridin 3582 at concentrations greater than 2 x 10(-4)m, which block deoxyribonucleic acid biosynthesis, produced an accelerated bactericidal action.
TI  - Differential action of a streptococcal bacteriocin on mycoplasmas and microbial L-forms.
AB  - Bacteriocin activity of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was tested against  a variety of bacteria, L-forms, and mycoplasmas. Both a partially purified liquid preparation and a colony overlay technique were used. Other S. faecalis strains were the only bacteria whose growth was inhibited. The liquid preparation inhibited growth of all but three of the tested L-forms (whether derived from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria), and two of these exceptional organisms were inhibited when the colony overlay technique was employed. On the other hand, the L-form of Streptobacillus moniliformis and all 33 tested mycoplasmas grew readily in the presence of the bacteriocin when either method was employed. It is suggested that the presence of cholesterol in the Streptobacillus and mycoplasmal membranes, unique in this regard among procaryotic cells, may be responsible for the differential pattern of growth inhibition.
TI  - The purification and properties of the -lactamase specified by the resistance factor R-1818 in Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - 1. The beta-lactamase specified by the R-1818 resistance factor in Escherichia coli was purified 300-fold; the resulting preparation gave a single peak on Sephadex G-100 and a single band on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 2. The beta-lactamase specified by the same R-factor in Proteus mirabilis was purified over 2000-fold, but was still far from pure. The specific activity of this preparation was one-fifth that of the purified enzyme from E. coli. 3. The two enzymes were shown to be identical as regards substrate specificity, pH optimum, K(m) values and molecular weight. 4. It is suggested that the low beta-lactamase activity of extracts of P. mirabilis (R-1818), about 5% of that from E. coli (R-1818) in crude extracts, could be due to inefficient transcription of the R-factor DNA by Proteus RNA polymerase.
TI  - Epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

AB  
TI  - Transduction of R factors by a Proteus mirabilis bacteriophage.
AB  - A transducing phage, designated phim, was isolated from a lysogenic strain of Proteus mirabilis and was characterized with respect to its physical and genetic properties. The phage contains double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with an S(20,w) degrees of 29 which corresponds to a molecular weight of 24 x 10(6) daltons. The base composition of phim DNA was estimated to be 40% guanine plus cytosine on the basis of the buoyant density of the DNA. phim carries out generalized transduction of chromosomal genes in P. mirabilis at a frequency of 5 x 10(-8) to 2 x 10(-6) per adsorbed phage. To obtain R-factor transduction, it was necessary to have a resident R factor in the recipient cells. In these experiments, different combinations of genetically distinguishable R factors were used in the donor and recipient cells. The frequencies of R-factor transduction were 10(-9) to 2 x 10(-8). The transduction of R factors using an R(-) recipient could not be detected. Transductant R factors were usually recombinant between donor and resident R factors. All of the transduced R factors were transferable by conjugation. A plausible explanation for the requirement for a resident R factor in the recipient cells is that phim transduces only a portion of the R-factor genome and therefore requires a resident R factor for genetic recombination. The reason for the low frequencies of R-factor transduction is not known, but some possible interpretations have been discussed.
TI  - Cephalexin: absorption and excretion as related to renal function and hemodialysis.
AB  - Cephalexin is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin C derivative, which is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted in high concentration in the urine. Even in patients with impaired renal function, the concentrations of cephalexin present in the urine are adequate for the treatment of most urinary tract infections produced by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. In anephric patients, single doses of 250 or 500 mg of cephalexin resulted in high, prolonged serum concentrations. Peak levels were usually observed within 1 hr. However, in two of six anephric patients, peak levels were reached after 6 and 12 hr due to delayed absorption. Hemodialysis for 6 hr reduced the serum concentration of cephalexin by 58%.
TI  - In vitro studies of semisynthetic alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins.
AB  - The activity of three alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins was evaluated in vitro against 599 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli, by use of the broth-dilution technique. At a concentration of 12.5 mug or less/ml, BL-P1597 inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas sp., 56% of Enterobacter sp., 67% of indole-positive Proteus spp., 72% of Escherichia coli, and 85% of Proteus mirabilis. BL-P1654 had similar activity, whereas BL-P1532 was much less active. At a concentration of 25 mug or less/ml, BL-P1597 also inhibited nearly 60% of isolates of Klebsiella sp. and nearly 40% of Serratia sp. BL-P1597 and BL-P1654 were as active as ampicillin and carbenicillin against E. coli and P. mirabilis. They were less active than carbenicillin against indole-positive Proteus spp. Both drugs were substantially more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas sp. A strain of Pseudomonas sp. which developed resistance to carbenicillin also developed resistance to the alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins simultaneously.

TI  - Asymmetric distribution of guanine plus thymine between complementary strands of  deoxyribonucleic acid of members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Analysis of the deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens in an alkaline CsCl gradient has shown that there is an asymmetric distribution of guanine plus thymine residues between the complementary strands of the deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Semisynthetic penicillin 6-(D(--)-alpha-carboxy-3-thienylacetamido) penicillanic  acid active against Pseudomonas in vitro.
AB  - The activity of 6-[d(-)-alpha-carboxy-3-thienylacetamido] penicillanic acid, BRL2288, was determined against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and various gram-negative bacilli. The majority of Pseudomonas strains (89%) were inhibited by 100 mug of the antibiotic per ml. BRL2288 is twofold more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas at 100 mug/ml or less. Among Enterobacteriaceae tested, 87% Enterobacter and 87% of Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug/ml or less. Indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug/ml or less. Fifty-five per cent of ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli were inhibited by 100 mug/ml. Klebsiella were uniformly resistant. BRL2288 is not hydrolyzed by most resistant Pseudomonas, but it is destroyed by the beta-lactamases of E. coli and P. mirabilis. The antibiotic shows synergy with gentamicin but not with penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as cloxacillin. Activity of BRL2288 against gram-positive organisms is two- to eightfold less than that of ampicillin or benzylpenicillin G.

AB  
TI  - The number of sex-factors per chromosome in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A substituted sex-factor of Escherichia coli, F'8 gal, was transferred to Proteus mirabilis by conjugation. The DNA of the episome was partially purified from Proteus DNA by preparative equilibrium centrifugation in caesium chloride, and by a bulk method using hydroxyapatite. The buoyant density of the episomal DNA is 1.707, corresponding to a (G+C) content of 47%. By optical renaturation the genetic complexity of the episomal DNA was found to be 76x10(6) daltons. RNA was synthesized in vitro by using the episomal DNA as template. By hybridizing this RNA with DNA extracted from E. coli carrying F'8 gal, it is shown that the number of copies of the episome per replicating chromosome is close to two during exponential growth. The episome makes up about 4.4% of the total DNA of the growing cells. The activities of galactokinase and galactose 1-phosphate uridylyl-transferase in cells with and without episomal and chromosomal gal genes were found to be proportional to the number of gal genes present, when the cells were induced with d-fucose, but not when they were induced with d-galactose.
TI  - Effect of pH on the activity of erythromycin against 500 isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Erythromycin was found to be a more effective inhibitor of gram-negative bacilli  in alkaline medium than in neutral or acid medium. A definite effect was noted with all of 500 recent clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis studied, but it was most striking with E. coli. At pH 8.5 all strains, except for 14% of those of P. mirabilis, were inhibited by concentrations of erythromycin readily achieved in urine with common therapeutic doses.
TI  - Trimodal response of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to penicillins.

TI  - Effect of mg and ethylenediaminetetraacetate on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of Mg(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) and novobiocin was determined against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis grown in Trypticase Soy Broth or defined synthetic medium. In the presence of EDTA, the activity of coumermycin A(1) was significantly enhanced (8- to 40-fold) against all four organisms in the synthetic medium lacking Mg(2+); novobiocin activity was increased to a lesser extent (4- to 16-fold) against three strains and remained unchanged against P. mirabilis. Addition of 200 mug of Mg(2+) per ml to the synthetic medium containing EDTA completely reversed the enhancement of activity of both antibiotics by EDTA only against P. aeruginosa. The addition of Mg(2+) to the synthetic medium appreciably inhibited the activity of novobiocin (sixfold) but not coumermycin A(1) against E. coli, and had little or no effect on the activity of either antibiotic against the remaining organisms. K. pneumoniae showed the greatest susceptibility to both antibiotics, and addition of EDTA enhanced this activity from 4-fold to 20-fold in all of the media tested. Subinhibitory concentrations of both antibiotics induced filament formation by all four organisms in all media. In addition, lysis of K. pneumoniae cells was observed.
TI  - Pyelonephritis therapy in rats: random association with excreted urinary antibacterial activity.
AB  - In vitro activities or excreted urinary activities of 56 generic and experimental drugs against two organisms commonly associated with human pyelonephritis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, are not correlated with the in vivo activities of these compounds as measured by reduction of viable organisms in kidneys in experimental pyelonephritis.
TI  - Non-chromosomal antibiotic resistance in bacteria. 3. Isolation of the discrete transfer unit of the R-factor R1.
AB  - A covalently-closed circular DNA species, banding at a buoyant density of rho = 1.709 g/cm(3) in CsCl, has been identified in antibiotic-sensitive colonies of E. coli strain AB2463 (rec A(-)) after mating with a Proteus mirabilis strain that carries the R-factor, R1. This plasmid, which represents a stable segregant of R1 that has lost all of the drug resistance determinants present on the parent R-factor but which has retained its ability to be transferred by conjugation, fulfills the functional definition of the R-factor transfer unit (RTF).
TI  - Circular R-factor molecules controlling penicillinase synthesis, replicating in Escherichia coli under either relaxed or stringent control.
AB  - Two infectious drug-resistance (R) factors, R28K and R6K, each conferring resistance to a number of penicillins by the synthesis of a penicillinase, were transferred to Proteus mirabilis PM1 and Escherichia coli RC85 host strains. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from these strains was separated by density-gradient centrifugation and subjected to electron microscopy by use of a modification of the protein-monolayer diffusion technique. Analytical density-gradient centrifugation of the purified DNA from PM1 strains showed, in addition to the major peak at a density of 1.698 g/cm(3) characteristic of Proteus chromosomal DNA, a single satellite band at a density of 1.710 g/cm(3) [guanine plus cytosine (GC) base ratio 50%] for R28K and at 1.704 g/cm(3) (GC base ratio 45%) for R6K. Direct CsCl density-gradient centrifugation of crude lysates of the E. coli (R28K)(+) strain in the presence of ethidium bromide gave rise to a sedimentation profile with a single satellite peak containing covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA molecules with a mean contour length of 21.4 mum [44 x 10(6) atomic mass units (AMU)], although a minority was 13.6 mum in length. From the size of the major class, it was estimated that there were two to three copies of the R28K factor present as CCC molecules per chromosome at various phases of cellular growth. Similar studies of the E. coli (R6K)(+) lysates showed two satellite peaks; peak I contained mostly CCC molecules of contour length 12.8 mum (26 x 10(6) AMU), and peak II, intermediate to peak I and the chromosomal peak, contained CCC molecules of a similar size, together with about equal numbers of catenated molecules, mostly dimers consisting of two interlocked monomers of 12.8 mum. A smaller number (ca. 0.1%) of higher catenanes was also seen. The number of CCC copies of the R6K factor per chromosome present in peak I was calculated as 13 at logarithmic phase and 38 at stationary phase. In peak II, a constant ratio of about one catenated dimer per chromosome was found at all phases of growth. Penicillinase assays of cultures at different phases of growth showed a correlation between the estimated number of R-factor copies present as CCC molecules and the enzyme activity per cell for both R28K and R6K.

TI  - Comparative study of isoenzyme formation of bacterial beta-galactosidase.
AB  - The enzyme beta-galactosidase was studied in crude extracts of Escherichia coli 3300, E. coli grown on a selenium and sulfur medium, Salmonella typhimurium F-lac, Serratia marcescens F-lac, S. marcescens P-lac, Proteus mirabilis F-lac, P. mirabilis P-lac, Aeromonas formicans, and Streptococcus lactis. The isoenzymes could be demonstrated by an alternative histochemical technique. Different isoenzyme patterns were found to be determined by the beta-galactosidase structural gene and not by the cytoplasm within which the beta-galactosidase was formed. In addition, the beta-galactosidases from strains which form isoenzymes were more stable to heat and urea treatments than the enzyme formed by those organisms which produce reduced amounts of, or no, isoenzyme.
TI  - Biosynthesis of ubiquinone in non-photosynthetic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 1. The polyprenylphenol and quinone complements of the non-photosynthetic Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas ovalis Chester, Proteus mirabilis and ;Vibrio O1' (Moraxella sp.), were investigated. 2. Ps. ovalis Chester and Prot. mirabilis were shown to contain 2-polyprenylphenols, 6-methoxy-2-polyprenylphenols, 6-methoxy-2-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinones, 5-demethoxyubiquinones, ubiquinones, an unidentified 1,4-benzoquinone [2-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone (?)] and ;epoxyubiquinones'. ;Vibrio O1' was shown to contain only 5-demethoxyubiquinones, ubiquinones and ;epoxyubiquinones'. 3. It was established that in Ps. ovalis Chester 2-polyprenylphenols, 6-methoxy-2-polyprenylphenols, 6-methoxy-2-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinones, 5-demethoxyubiquinones and 2-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinones (?) are precursors of ubiquinones. 4. Intracellular distribution studies showed that in Ps. ovalis Chester ubiquinone and its prenylated precursors are localized entirely on the protoplast membrane. 5. Investigations into the oxygen requirements for ubiquinone biosynthesis by Ps. ovalis Chester showed that the organism could not convert p-hydroxybenzoic acid into ubiquinone in the absence of oxygen, although it could convert a limited amount into 2-polyprenylphenols. 6. Attempts were made to prepare cell-free preparations capable of synthesizing ubiquinone. Purified protoplast membranes of Ps. ovalis Chester were found to be incapable of carrying out this synthesis, even when supplemented with cytoplasm. With crushed-cell preparations of Ps. ovalis Chester, organism PC4 (Achromobacter sp.) and Escherichia coli, synthesis was observed, although this was attributable in part to a small number of intact cells present in the preparations.
TI  - A comparison of the effects of ampicillin on Escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis.
AB  
TI  - Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacilli to ampicillin after six years' clinical use.
AB  - A total of 1,102 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli was obtained from four hospitals during 1967 and these cultures were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin. Approximately 80% of the strains of Escherichia coli and 90% of the strains of Proteus mirabilis, the two organisms most frequently isolated, were sensitive to ampicillin. Klebsiella-Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally insensitive. Comparison of these results with data obtained in an earlier study with Gram-negative organisms isolated in 1961 showed that there had been no significant increase in the incidence of resistance of Gram-negative bacilli to ampicillin during the period 1961-67. The majority of ampicillin-resistant strains of E. coli isolated in 1967 transferred ampicillin resistance to a sensitive strain of E. coli K12. Only four ampicillin-resistant strains of E. coli isolated in 1961 were available for transferable resistance tests but all four strains transferred ampicillin resistance. Infective or transferable resistance was therefore a feature of ampicillin resistance of certain Gram-negative bacteria before ampicillin became generally available for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of coumermycin A1.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. Coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against Staphylococcus aureus. It was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. Coumermycin also showed good activity against group A streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against Escherichia coli, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against Klebsiella-Enterobacter and enterococci. Against P. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. The new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. Coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. Also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - In a period of two years, 865 strains of Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. The commonest species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Many strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Bacterium anitratum were also found.A large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. The proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. A large proportion of the strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. Multiple resistance occurred less often among strains of E. coli than among Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, and P. mirabilis. Phage and serological typing of Ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. Taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with Ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.
TI  - Site of action of nitrofurantoin in experimental urinary tract infection.
AB  - The effectiveness of nitrofurantoin in suppressing bacterial growth in the urinary tract was evaluated by using two different experimental models. Pyelonephritis was produced in rats by direct inoculation of 10(4)Escherichia coli in the medulla of left kidney. Ascending urinary tract infection was induced by inoculation into the urinary bladder of 10(7)Proteus mirabilis, after a partial cystectomy. Nitrofurantoin was shown to be effective in suppressing bladder bacteriuria, in preventing ascending pyelonephritis, and also in preventing bacterial multiplication in kidney tissue following direct inoculation.
TI  - Nature of lactose-fermenting Salmonella strains obtained from clinical sources.
AB  - Six of seven lactose-fermenting (lac(+)) Salmonella strains obtained from clinical sources were found to be capable of transferring the lac(+) property by conjugation to Salmonella typhosa WR4204. All of the six S. typhosa strains which received the lac(+) property transferred it in turn to S. typhimurium WR5000 at the high frequencies typical of extrachromosomal F-merogenotes. These six lac elements were also transmissible from S. typhosa WR4204 to Proteus mirabilis and to some strains of Escherichia coli K-12; moreover, they were capable of promoting low frequency transfer of chromosomal genes from S. typhimurium WR5000 to S. typhosa WR4204. One of these lac elements was shown also to be capable of promoting low frequency chromosome transfer in E. coli K-12. E. coli K-12 strains harboring these lac elements exhibited sensitivity to the male specific phage R-17. Sensitivity to R-17 was not detected in Salmonella strains containing the elements. Examination of the lac elements in P. mirabilis by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation showed that each element had a guanine plus cytosine content of 50%. The sizes of the elements varied from 0.8 to 3% of the total Proteus deoxyribonucleic acid. The amount of beta-galactosidase produced by induced and uninduced cultures of S. typhimurium WR5000 and S. typhosa WR4204 containing the lac elements was lower than that produced by these strains with the F-lac episome. The heat sensitivity of beta-galactosidase produced by the lac elements in their original Salmonella hosts indicated that the enzyme made by these strains differs from E. coli beta-galactosidase.
TI  - In vitro studies of a new semisynthetic penicillin, 6-(d-alpha-sulfoaminophenylacetamido)-penicillanic acid.
AB  - The activity of 6-(D-alpha-sulfoaminophenylacetamido)-penicillanic acid was determined against 357 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli by use of the tube-dilution technique. The majority of the isolates of Pseudomonas species were inhibited by 200 mug/ml or less of this antibiotic. Most of the isolates of Escherichia coli had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 50 mug/ml or less. Seventy-three per cent of the isolates of P. mirabilis, 40% of the isolates of P. morganii, and 45% of the isolates of Enterobacter species were inhibited by 12.5 mug/ml or less, whereas most of the isolates of Klebsiella species and Serratia species were resistant. The activity of this semisynthetic penicillin was affected by the size of the inoculum. The drug was bactericidal against all isolates of E. coli and Proteus species that were sensitive to it, but it was bactericidal against only 32% of the sensitive isolates of Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. The amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. In only three cases: Escherichia coli-Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium-S. typhi, and Proteus mirabilis-P. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. In most cases interspecies DNA duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies DNA reassociation reactions. The stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 C was virtually identical to that of homologous E. coli DNA duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected by the temperature increase (86% at 60 C; 77% at 75 C). The thermal stability of DNA duplexes formed at 60 C between DNA from E. coli and DNA from strains of Aerobacter aerogenes, S. typhimurium, S. typhi, and P. mirabilis was about 12 to 14 C below that of reassociated E. coli DNA. At 75 C, the formation of the interspecific DNA duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the DNA able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated E. coli DNA. The degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. The other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their DNA can reanneal with E. coli DNA at 60 C and less than 10% reacts at 75 C. The degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the DNA molecule. Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. An examination of messenger RNA relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less than the genome as a whole.
TI  - Trimethoprim--sulphamethoxazole: comparative study in urinary infection in hospital.
AB  - Trimethoprim is inhibitory for a wide range of bacteria, and when used in combination with a sulphonamide marked synergy has been reported.In order to test its value in the treatment of urinary infections 154 hospital patients with infections of varying severity and due to a wide range of organisms were treated with combinations of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Combinations of these substances in two different ratios (2:1 and 10:1) were used in 113 patients, and one week after the end of treatment about three-quarters were cured by both combinations. In a second study 106 patients were treated with a sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination (5:1), ampicillin, or sulphadimidine. The cure rate with the 5:1 combination was higher than that found with ampicillin or sulphadimidine both one week after finishing treatment (sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim 85%, ampicillin 70%, sulphadimidine 40%) and at the fourth- to fifth-week follow-up (sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim 67%, ampicillin 52%, sulphadimidine 15%).The results obtained with the various sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combinations did not indicate that a particular ratio was superior for treating urinary infections in general or for those caused by any particular species of organism.Laboratory studies showed that many bacteria causing urinary infections in hospital were sensitive to trimethoprim, and the therapeutic results could have been largely predicted from a knowledge of the in-vitro sensitivity tests to trimethoprim alone. For example, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the treatment of Proteus mirabilis infections was less successful than in those due to Escherichia coli, and this finding was clearly reflected in the higher minimal inhibitory concentrations for trimethoprim of Pr. mirabilis.The sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination was simple to administer, free from side-effects, and gave satisfactory results in the treatment of urinary infections that occurred in hospital patients.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin C antibiotic.
AB  - Concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. The in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. All strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all S. aureus, 80% of Escherichia coli, 72% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and 56% of Proteus mirabilis strains. About 90 to 96% of E. coli, Klebsiella Aerobacter, and P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. A peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. A mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. Food did not interfere with absorption. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. The mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group A streptococci, D. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, 85% of E. coli, and about 40 to 75% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter and P. mirabilis strains. Levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of E. coli, and P. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter strains.
TI  - Antibacterial mechanisms of the urinary bladder.
AB  - THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BACTERIA FROM THE NORMAL URINARY BLADDER IS APPARENTLY A FUNCTION OF TWO HOST DEFENSE MECHANISMS: the mechanical clearance of organisms by voiding, and the antibacterial activity of the bladder wall. This study quantified the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to the resistance of the bladder to bacterial infection.(32)Phosphorus-labeled E. coli. S. aureus, and P. mirabilis were each injected into the urinary bladders of unanesthetized female guinea pigs. At intervals after voiding, the bladders were removed, washed, homogenized, and assayed for residual radioactivity and viable bacteria. Mechanical clearance was measured by the changes in total radioactive count. Antibacterial activity was quantified by comparing the bacterial to radioactive ratios of the original bacterial inoculum with similar ratios in the bladder homogenates. More than 99.9% of the bladder inoculum was rapidly excreted and about 0.1% (10(4)-10(5)) organisms remained attached to the bladder wall. Of those E. coli attached to the bladder, rapid sequential reduction in viability occurred and reached a level of 85% loss at 30 min after inoculation. 4 hr after challenge, less than 10% of those organisms still attached to the bladder mucosa remained viable. P. mirabilis was handled with equal facility, but S. aureus showed a reduction in viability of only 46% at 1 hr and 67% at 4 hr after inoculation. 6 hr after infection with S. aureus, 6 of 12 guinea pig bladders showed multiplication of the organisms still attached to the bladder wall; only 1 of 12 animals challenged with E. coli had comparable multiplication. The mechanism whereby the bladder wall kills bacteria is unclear, but it did not appear to be related to an antibacterial activity of urine, clumping of organisms on bladder mucosa, phagocytosis by leukocytes, or serum levels of bactericidal antibody. Although it is clear that the bladder exhibits intrinsic antibacterial properties, the role of this defense mechanism in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection requires further clarification.
TI  - Protection by vaccination against Pseudomonas infection after thermal injury.
AB  - Active immunization is effective in the prophylaxis of Pseudomonas septicemia in  burned mice. Vaccines were prepared from bacterial cells and growth medium of Verder's 10 different O serological types of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, as well as from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Mice given a tail burn could be significantly protected against a local Pseudomonas challenge by both specific and, to a lesser extent, by nonspecific Pseudomonas vaccines prepared either from bacterial cells or from the medium in which they were grown. The vaccine was effective when administered prior to or after thermal trauma. After a more extensive rump burn, the protective effect of a specific vaccine given after thermal injury was significant only when the challenge was postponed until 4 days postburn; the level of protection was less than in the mice with smaller burns.

TI  - Production of the Shwartzman reaction with microbial L forms.
AB  - Study of potential pathogenicity of microbial L forms was done by the localized Shwartzman reaction. Stable L forms of Proteus mirabilis served as skin preparation in rabbits for induction of Shwartzman reaction by subsequent intravenous injection of either P. mirabilis L forms or Escherichia coli endotoxin. The intensity of the reaction was positively correlated to numbers of L forms in the skin. L forms also served as the intravenous challenge. In vivo multiplication of L forms was not a prerequisite for the reaction, as it could be produced with nonviable, osmotically lysed L forms. The reaction produced with L forms in the skin was more intense than that produced with the parent bacterial form. These latter observations, coupled with the demonstration that L forms disappeared from the skin (lysed?) after 4 hr, in contrast to bacteria which were recoverable for 72 hr (duration of study), suggest release of endotoxin by L forms as a pathogenic mechanism.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  - Serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. The in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. All strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Eighty per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Klebsiella-Aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. When single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. A full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. The peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group A streptococci and D. pneumoniae. Many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis. Urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the E. coli and P. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of Klebsiella-Aerobacter.
TI  - Effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - In an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in Mueller-Hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. Studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of different antibiotics were investigated. With 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. Therefore, despite minor variations when the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that Mueller-Hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. A simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by the more arduous plate dilution test.

TI  - Occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  Escherichia coli, carrying an R factor was investigated in various gram-negative bacilli. The acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. The investigated strains were of the Salmonella-Arizona group, the Klebsiella-Aerobacter group, Serratia marcescens, the Proteus group, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. Both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. In the Proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. Some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. Only the sensitive strains containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. Thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. All of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). All of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of Enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the Klebsiella-Aerobacter group and of S. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. With respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the R factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of Proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.

TI  - Bacterial interference induced in embryonated eggs by staphylococci.
AB  - Studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. All strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. The interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (A(2)J 305). Prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.Interference required infection with viable bacteria. The onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. The protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. Studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. Other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. Similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated virulence of the challenge organisms. All interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.
TI  - The role of the microbial flora in uremia. I. Survival times of germfree, limited-flora, and conventionalized rats after bilateral nephrectomy and fasting.
AB  - Germfree rats were used in 3 experiments to study the effects of the microbial flora on survival time after acute uremia produced by a one-stage bilateral nephrectomy. Germfree rats, limited-flora rats, and conventionalized rats (all maintained continuously in isolators) were subjected to nephrectomy or to sham nephrectomy, deprived of food and water until they died, respectively, of uremia or of starvation, and their survival times compared. To establish a limited defined flora in advance of nephrectomy, germfree rats were either monocontaminated (Staphylococcus albus), dicontaminated (S. albus and Proteus mirabilis) or tetracontaminated (S. albus, S. faecalis, P. mirabilis, and E. coli); to conventionalize germfree rats, they were exposed to the mixed microbial flora contained in the cecal contents of ordinary rats, which was the source of the aforementioned bacteria and which included other uncharacterized microorganisms as well. The intestine of all rats with a limited flora persisted in a morphologic state that was virtually no different from that of the germfree rat, including the presence of an enlarged, thin-walled cecum; by contrast, the intestine of the conventionalized rats permanently assumed the morphological characteristics of ordinary, open-laboratory rats with the cecum reduced to normal size. After nephrectomy and food and water deprivation (death from anuria): (a) All germfree rats but one outlived their conventionalized counterparts in each of the 3 experiments; the 21 germfree rats (127 hr) lived, on the average, 2 days longer than did the 24 conventionalized rats (75 hr). No sex difference was demonstrated. (b) The rats with a limited flora died correspondingly sooner as the complexity of their flora increased; survival time of the tetracontaminated rats was significantly shorter than that of the germfree rats, and statistically no different from that of the conventionalized rats. After sham nephrectomy and food and water deprivation (delayed death from starvation): (a) All rats, irrespective of microbial status or sex, outlived their fasting nephrectomized partners. The conventionalized rats endured starvation approximately 2.5 wk longer than they did anuria and the germfree rats 1 wk longer. (b) All conventionalized rats, both male and female, outlived their respective germfree counterparts by about 1 wk. (c) All males, irrespective of microbial status, survived longer than did the females; the average difference was 4 days. The differences in tolerance to anuria or starvation did not correlate with initial body weight or rate of weight loss.

Bacteriol. 89:1231-1236. 1965.-Male-specific bacteriophage MS2 was shown to infect and grow in Proteus mirabilis strains which harbor F-genotes derived from Escherichia coli K-12. The burst size was 2,000 to 3,000, which is similar to that in E. coli K-12, whereas the latent period was 45 min, definitely longer than that in E. coli. In spite of the multiplication of MS2 in male P. mirabilis in broth, P. mirabilis strains failed to show plaque formation by MS2 on agar plates; this failure may be related to the low efficiency of phage adsorption. No host-controlled modification of MS2 by P. mirabilis was detected.

Nature of lac(+)Proteus strains isolated from clinical specimens. J. Bacteriol. 88:1598-1601. 1964.-Strains of Proteus mirabilis exhibiting the unusual property of utilizing lactose (lac(+)) have been reported in clinical material. A genetic examination discloses that the lac(+) determinants in these Proteus strains are associated with an infectious element, P, which is distinct from the sex factor of Escherichia coli K-12. The composite genetic element, P-lac, is readily transmissible to other enteric species and possesses properties which conform to those of an episomic element of the transfer variety. CsCl density-gradient studies of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from lac(+)P. mirabilis indicate that the P-lac(+) element did not arise in this species, but was acquired from an organism possessing a markedly different DNA base composition.
TI  - A NEW SELECTIVE BLOOD AGAR MEDIUM FOR STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES AND OTHER HAEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

Bacteriol. 83:1260-1267. 1962.-The aerobic bacterial intestinal flora of mutton birds, healthy and affected with "limy" disease, was investigated, mainly in birds from Great Dog Island, Bass Strait, Australia. A total of 1,274 specimens from gut on post-mortem and from cloacal swabs was examined. No indication was obtained of a pathogenic bacterial species concerned in "limy" disease. A study was made of the types of organisms and their distribution in the gut of mutton birds. The sparsity, or occasional absence, of aerobic bacterial flora in some birds, especially adults, was noticed. The "limy" birds, by comparison with normal chicks, had a richer flora more evenly distributed through the alimentary canal. A higher ratio of gram-negative to gram-positive bacterial types was recorded in chicks; adult birds had a lower or an even numerical ratio. The comparatively frequent occurrence of Proteus species, except P. mirabilis, and of irregular and intermediate coliform types was evident. Escherichia coli type I was not a constant inhabitant of the gut. The gram-positive flora consisted mostly of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, S. lactis, and Enterococcus. The possibility that "limy" disease may be caused by physiological factors is discussed.
TI  - The role of immunity in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis.
AB  - Hematogenous pyelonephritis was produced in rats utilizing multiple strains of Escherichia coli, a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and a strain of Proteus mirabilis. Three patterns of hematogenous pyelonephritis occurred which represent an interrelationship between an immune response to the infecting bacteria and the development of obstructive uropathy as a consequence of infection. First, the course of pyelonephritis due to strains of Escherichia coli was acute, self-limited, and associated with the development of circulating agglutinins. Following healing, this pattern of infection was associated with acquired resistance to reinfection with the same bacterial strain. Second, the course of pyelonephritis due to a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae type C was chronic. This infection was not associated with the production of circulating agglutinins against encapsulated strains. Acquired resistance to reinfection by the homotypic strain could not be demonstrated following eradication of infection but was produced by the passive transfer of concentrated antiserum. Third, pyelonephritis due to Proteus mirabilis was associated with circulating agglutinins and resistance to reinfection with the same organism following eradication of infection, yet the course was chronic. The chronicity appeared to be the consequence of obstructive uropathy resulting from calculi which developed during the course of the infection. Resistance to reinfection was demonstrated in infections with strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis. The resistance is associated with specific immunity as demonstrated by the observation that: (a) it is type-specific, (b) it is of at least 3 months' duration, and (c) it can be passively transferred by means of rabbit antiserum. Since K. pneumoniae failed to evoke capsular antibodies in the rat, resistance to infection with K. pneumoniae was produced only by means of passively transferred concentrated rabbit antiserum and not by prior infection. Immunity can be demonstrated to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis only in the absence of obstructive uropathy.
