vaginal lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not coxsackievirus b4e2.
this study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 (l. gasseri cmul57), l. acidophilus cmul67 and l. plantarum cmul140 against herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2) and coxsackievirus b4e2 (cvb4e2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. these lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by hsv-2 in vero cell monolayers. however, lactobacilli were not active against cvb4e2. tested lactobacilli displayed anti-hsv-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to vero cell monolayers. the detection of hsv-2 dna by pcr in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-hsv-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. this study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as hsv-2.
detection and quantification of probiotic strain lactobacillus gasseri k7 in faecal samples by targeting bacteriocin genes.
lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a probiotic strain that produces bacteriocins gassericin k7 a and k7 b. in order to develop a real-time quantitative pcr assay for the detection of l. gasseri k7, 18 reference strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and 45 faecal samples of adults who have never consumed strain k7 were tested with pcr using 14 pairs of primers specific for gassericin k7 a and k7 b gene determinants. incomplete gassericin k7 a or k7 b gene clusters were found to be dispersed in different lactobacilli strains as well as in faecal microbiota. one pair of primers was found to be specific for the total gene cluster of gassericin k7a and one for gassericin k7b. the real-time pcr analysis of faecal samples spiked with k7 strain revealed that primers specific for the gene cluster of the gassericin k7 a were more suitable for quantitative determination than those for gassericin k7 b, due to the lower detection level. targeting of the gassericin k7 a or k7 b gene cluster with specific primers could be used for detection and quantification of l. gasseri k7 in human faecal samples without prior cultivation. the results of this study also present new insights into the prevalence of bacteriocin-encoding genes in gastrointestinal tract.
characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.
chromosomal location of the genetic determinants for bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri k7.
the production of similar or even identical bacteriocins by different lactic acid bacteria is not a rare event. to take advantage of this finding, genetic determinants of the lactobacillus k7 bacteriocins were tested for putative homologies with previously described bacteriocins of the lactobacillus acidophilus group through polymerase chain reaction (pcr). among specific primer pairs of seven known bacteriocins, derived from their respective sequences, only acidocin lf221 a and b primers amplified fragments in chromosomal dna of k7 strain that revealed strong similarity over small regions of lf221 bacteriocins. treatment of lactobacillus k7 with ethidium bromide and mitomycin c was ineffective in generating non-bacteriocinogenic derivatives and had no impact on plasmid loss either. classification studies elucidated lactobacillus k7 as a member of the lactobacillus gasseri species.
gassericin a; an uncommon cyclic bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39 linked at n- and c-terminal ends.
gassericin a, a bacteriocin that was produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, was  treated with lysylendopeptidase and 3-bromo-3-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenyl-mercapto)-3h-indole. the fragments were recovered by sds-page and sequenced. all amino acids of gassericin a were distributed by sequence analysis and the bacteriocin did not contain any modified amino acids. the amino acid sequence of gassericin a completely coincided with that found through the cloning of the structural gene. gassericin a was shown to be a cyclic bacteriocin (class ii) which is bound at the n- and c-terminal ends. this is the first example of a cyclic bacteriocin from lactobacilli lactic acid bacteria.
sequence analysis by cloning of the structural gene of gassericin a, a hydrophobic bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39.
gassericin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus gasseri la39, was purified to homogeneity from the culturesupernatant mainly by reverse-phase chromatography. the molecular weight of gassericin a was found to be 5,652 by mass analysis, unlike the estimated 3,800 found by sds-page. however, when the purified preparation was treated with lysylendopeptidase, it migrated as a single band to 5,600 with bacteriocin activity on sds-page. n- and c-terminal amino acids could not be identified. the internal amino acid could be identified after gassericin a was hydrolyzed with lysylendopeptidase. the dna of the structural gene of gassericin a was sequenced by cloning of the gene from chromosomal dna with an oligonucleotide probe. the structural gene of gassericin a was found on the chromosomal dna as an open reading frame encoding a protein composed of 91 amino acids. the amino acid sequence of mature gassericin a was predicted to be 58 residues from the dna sequence and results of mass analysis. these results suggested that gassericin a has a closed circular structure with n- and c-terminals linked. gassericin a is a hydrophobic class ii bacteriocin; it was 98% identical with acidocin b produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
isolation and partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus  gasseri jcm 2124.
four antibacterially active peptides (b1 to b4) were purified from the culture broth of l. gasseri jcm 2124. the b2 peptide (gassericin b2) was determined to be 4400 da by mass spectrometry and partially sequenced. gassericin b2 did not show any sequence similarities to other known bacteriocins. the b1 and b3 peptides shared identical sequences with two peptides of a two-component bacteriocin from lactobacillus acidophilus. however, synergistic activity upon complementation of b1 and b3 was not observed. based on amino acid sequencing and molecular mass, it is suggested that b1 and b4 peptides were derived from b3 (gassericin b3).
inhibition of food-borne pathogenic bacteria by bacteriocins from lactobacillus gasseri.
lactobacillus acidophilus group and a lact. reuteri isolated from human faeces were examined for production of antimicrobial agents against 16 strains of six species of food-borne enteric pathogenic bacteria. several strains of lact. gasseri showed wide inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria. gassericin a produced by lact. gasseri la39 was one of the most widely active bacteriocins. it was bactericidal without causing cell lysis.
