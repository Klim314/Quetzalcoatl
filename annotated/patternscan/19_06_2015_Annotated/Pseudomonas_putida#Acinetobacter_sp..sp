TI  == integrated engineering of beta-oxidation reversal and omega-oxidation pathways for the synthesis of medium chain omega-functionalized carboxylic acids.
AB  == an engineered reversal of the beta-oxidation cycle was exploited to demonstrate its utility for the synthesis of medium chain (6-10-carbons) omega-hydroxyacids and dicarboxylic acids from glycerol as the only carbon source. a redesigned beta-oxidation reversal facilitated the production of medium chain carboxylic acids, which were converted to omega-hydroxyacids and dicarboxylic acids by the action of an engineered omega-oxidation pathway. the selection of a key thiolase  (bktb) and thioesterase (ydii) in combination with previously established core beta-oxidation reversal enzymes, as well as the development of chromosomal expression systems for the independent control of pathway enzymes, enabled the generation of c6-c10 carboxylic acids and provided a platform for vector based independent expression of omega-functionalization enzymes. using this approach, the expression of the pseudomonas putida alkane monooxygenase system, encoded by  alkbgt, in combination with all beta-oxidation reversal enzymes resulted in the production of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid, and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid. following identification and characterization of potential alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, chnd and chne from acinetobacter sp. strain se19 were expressed in conjunction with alkbgt to demonstrate the synthesis of the c6-c10 dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid, suberic acid, and sebacic acid. the potential of a beta-oxidation cycle with omega-oxidation termination pathways was further demonstrated through the production of greater than 0.8 g/l c6-c10 omega-hydroxyacids or about 0.5 g/l dicarboxylic acids of the same chain lengths from glycerol (an unrelated carbon source) using minimal media.

TI  == cloning of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene and construction of a stable genetically engineered strain for degrading crude oil.
AB  == pseudomonas putida strain bnf1 was isolated to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons efficiently and use phenol as a main carbon and energy source to support its growth. catechol 2,3-dioxygenase was found to be the responsible key enzyme for the biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons. catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene was cloned from plasmid dna of p. putida strain bnf1. the nucleotide base sequence of a 924 bp segment encoding the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (c23o) was determined. this segment showed an open reading frame, which encoded a polypeptide of 307 amino acids. c23o gene was inserted into noti-cut transposon vector put/mini-tn5  (km(r)) to get a novel transposon vector put/mini-tn5-c23o. with the helper plasmid prk2013, the transposon vector put/mini-tn5-c23o was introduced into one  alkanes degrading strain acinetobacter sp. bs3 by triparental conjugation, and then the c23o gene was integrated into the chromosome of acinetobacter sp. bs3. and the recombinant bs3-c23o, which could express catechol 2,3-dioxygenase protein, was obtained. the recombinant bs3-c23o was able to degrade various aromatic hydrocarbons and n-alkanes. broad substrate specificity, high enzyme activity, and the favorable stability suggest that the bs3-c23o was a potential candidate used for the biodegradation of crude oil.

TI  == aerobic granulation of aggregating consortium x9 isolated from aerobic granules and role of cyclic di-gmp.
AB  == this study monitored the granulation process of an aggregating functional consortium x9 that was consisted of pseudomonas putida x-1, acinetobacter sp. x-2, alcaligenes sp. x-3 and comamonas testosteroni x-4 in shaken reactors. the growth curve of x9 was fit using logistic model as follows y=1.49/(1+21.3*exp(-0.33x)), the maximum specific cell growth rate for x9 was 0.33 h(-1). initially x9 consumed polysaccharides (ps) and secreted proteins (pn) to trigger granulation. then x9 grew in biomass and formed numerous micro-granules, driven by increasing hydrophobicity of cell membranes and of accumulated extracellular polymeric substances (eps). in later stage the intracellular cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) was at high levels for inhibiting bacteria swarming motility, thereby promotion formation of large aerobic granules. the findings reported herein advise the way to accelerate granule formation and to stabilize operation in aerobic granular reactors.

TI  == function of a glutamine synthetase-like protein in bacterial aniline oxidation via gamma-glutamylanilide.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. strain yaa has five genes (atda1 to atda5) involved in aniline  oxidation as a part of the aniline degradation gene cluster. from sequence analysis, the five genes were expected to encode a glutamine synthetase (gs)-like protein (atda1), a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein (atda2), and an aromatic compound dioxygenase (atda3, atda4, and atda5) (m. takeo, t. fujii, and  y. maeda, j. ferment. bioeng. 85:17-24, 1998). a recombinant pseudomonas strain harboring these five genes quantitatively converted aniline into catechol, demonstrating that catechol is the major oxidation product from aniline. to elucidate the function of the gs-like protein atda1 in aniline oxidation, we purified it from recombinant escherichia coli harboring atda1. the purified atda1 protein produced gamma-glutamylanilide (gamma-ga) quantitatively from aniline and l-glutamate in the presence of atp and mgcl2. this reaction was identical to glutamine synthesis by gs, except for the use of aniline instead of ammonia as the substrate. recombinant pseudomonas strains harboring the dioxygenase genes (atda3 to atda5) were unable to degrade aniline but converted gamma-ga into catechol, indicating that gamma-ga is an intermediate to catechol and a direct substrate for the dioxygenase. unexpectedly, a recombinant pseudomonas strain harboring only atda2 hydrolyzed gamma-ga into aniline, reversing the gamma-ga formation by atda1. deletion of atda2 from atda1 to atda5 caused gamma-ga accumulation from aniline in recombinant pseudomonas cells and inhibited the growth of a recombinant acinetobacter strain on aniline, suggesting that atda2 prevents gamma-ga accumulation that is harmful to the host cell.

TI  == study in vitro of the impact of endophytic bacteria isolated from centella asiatica on the disease incidence caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
AB  == thirty-one endophytic bacteria isolated from healthy leaves of centella asiatica  were screened in vitro for their ability to reduce the growth rate and disease incidence of colletotrichum higginsianum, a causal agent of anthracnose. isolates of cohnella sp., paenibacillus sp. and pantoea sp. significantly stimulated the growth rate of c. higginsianum mucl 44942, while isolates of achromobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., microbacterium sp., klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas putida had  no influence on this plant pathogen. by contrast, bacillus subtilis bca31 and pseudomonas fluorescens bca08 caused a marked inhibition of c. higginsianum mucl  44942 growth by 46 and 82 %, respectively. cell-free culture filtrates of b. subtilis bca31 and p. fluorescens bca08 were found to contain antifungal compounds against c. higginsianum mucl 44942. inoculation assays on in vitro-cultured plants of c. asiatica showed that foliar application of b. subtilis bca31, three days before inoculation with c. higginsianum mucl 44942, significantly reduced incidence and severity of the disease. the role of endophytic bacteria in maintaining the apparent inactivity of c. higginsianum mucl 44942 in c. asiatica grown in the wild is discussed.

TI  == optimization of fenton process for decoloration and cod removal in tobacco wastewater and toxicological evaluation of the effluent.
AB  == decoloration and chemical oxygen demand (cod) removal in tobacco wastewater by fenton process has been optimized under 25 +/- 2 degrees c. the results showed that the optimal range of conditions were ph 4.13-4.66, fe(2+) 0.29-0.34 g/l and  h2o2 > or = 2.73 g/l. within this range, up to 95% of colour and 90% of cod was removed. in an enlarged system, setting the optimal conditions as ph 4.50, fe(2+) 0.34 g/l and h2o2 4.00 g/l, the colour removal rate was 96.03 +/- 2.57%, with cod removal rate of 93.30 +/- 2.92%. the residual cod of 73.67 +/- 19.70 mg/l in effluent had hit the state's first-class standard for the industrial discharge in china (< 100 mg/l cod, gb8978-1996). the ecological safety of fenton process has  also been evaluated. when reaction completed, the content of hydroxyl free radical (oh) was 3.26 +/- 0.44 mg/l. there was no inhibition of fenton effluent in growth of escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp. hf-1, acinetobacter sp. tw and sphingomonas sp. ty. no oxidative stress was induced on  strain hf-1 by fenton effluent. thus, fenton process was one of high-efficiency and ecologically safe strategy for tobacco wastewater advanced treatment.

TI  == characterization of copper-resistant rhizosphere bacteria from avena sativa and plantago lanceolata for copper bioreduction and biosorption.
AB  == copper is a toxic heavy metal widely used to microbial control especially in agriculture. consequently, high concentrations of copper residues remain in soils selecting copper-resistant organisms. in vineyards, copper is routinely used for  fungi control. this work was undertaken to study copper resistance by rhizosphere microorganisms from two plants (avena sativa l. and plantago lanceolata l.) common in vineyard soils. eleven rhizosphere microorganisms were isolated, and four displayed high resistance to copper. the isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis as pseudomonas putida (a1), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (a2) and acinetobacter sp. (a6), isolated from avena sativa rhizosphere, and acinetobacter sp. (t5), isolated from plantago lanceolata rhizosphere. the isolates displayed high copper resistance in the temperature range from 25 degrees c to 35 degrees c and ph in the range from 5.0 to 9.0. pseudomonas putida a1 resisted as much as 1,000 mg l(-1) of copper. the isolates  showed similar behavior on copper removal from liquid medium, with a bioremoval rate of 30% at 500 mg l(-1) after 24 h of growth. speciation of copper revealed high copper biotransformation, reducing cu(ii) to cu(i), capacity. results indicate that our isolates are potential agents for copper bioremoval and bacterial stimulation of copper biosorption by avena sativa and plantago lanceolata.

TI  == isolation of a selected microbial consortium capable of degrading methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol from a contaminated soil site.
AB  == a bacterial consortium with the ability to degrade methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol, using these compounds as the only carbon source, was obtained by selective enrichment in a medium with methyl parathion. samples were taken from moravia, medellin; an area that is highly contaminated, owing to the fact that it was used as a garbage dump from 1974 to 1982. acinetobacter sp, pseudomonas putida, bacillus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii, stenotrophomonas sp, flavobacterium sp, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas sp, acinetobacter sp, klebsiella sp and proteus sp were the microorganisms identified within the consortium. in culture, the consortium was able to degrade 150 mg l(-)(1) of methyl-parathion and p-nitrophenol in 120 h, but after adding glucose  or peptone to the culture, the time of degradation decreased to 24 h. in soil, the consortium was also able to degrade 150 mg l(-)(1) of methyl parathion in 120 h at different depths and also managed to decrease the toxicity.

TI  == new alk genes detected in antarctic marine sediments.
AB  == alkane monooxygenases (alk) are the key enzymes for alkane degradation. in order  to understand the dispersion and diversity of alk genes in antarctic marine environments, this study analysed by clone libraries the presence and diversity of alk genes (alkb and alkm) in sediments from admiralty bay, king george island, peninsula antarctica. the results show a differential distribution of alk genes between the sites, and the predominant presence of new alk genes, mainly in the pristine site. sequences presented 53.10-69.60% nucleotide identity and 50.90-73.40% amino acid identity to alkb genes described in silicibacter pomeroyi, gordonia sp., prauserella rugosa, nocardioides sp., rhodococcus sp., nocardia farcinica, pseudomonas putida, acidisphaera sp., alcanivorax borkumensis, and alkm described in acinetobacter sp. this is the first time that  the gene alkm was detected and described in antarctic marine environments. the presence of a range of previously undescribed alk genes indicates the need for further studies in this environment.

TI  == in vivo evolution of butane oxidation by terminal alkane hydroxylases alkb and cyp153a6.
AB  == enzymes of the alkb and cyp153 families catalyze the first step in the catabolism of medium-chain-length alkanes, selective oxidation of the alkane to the 1-alkanol, and enable their host organisms to utilize alkanes as carbon sources.  small, gaseous alkanes, however, are converted to alkanols by evolutionarily unrelated methane monooxygenases. propane and butane can be oxidized by cyp enzymes engineered in the laboratory, but these produce predominantly the 2-alkanols. here we report the in vivo-directed evolution of two medium-chain-length terminal alkane hydroxylases, the integral membrane di-iron enzyme alkb from pseudomonas putida gpo1 and the class ii-type soluble cyp153a6 from mycobacterium sp. strain hxn-1500, to enhance their activity on small alkanes. we established a p. putida evolution system that enables selection for terminal alkane hydroxylase activity and used it to select propane- and butane-oxidizing enzymes based on enhanced growth complementation of an adapted p. putida gpo12(pgec47 delta b) strain. the resulting enzymes exhibited higher rates of 1-butanol production from butane and maintained their preference for terminal hydroxylation. this in vivo evolution system could be useful for directed evolution of enzymes that function efficiently to hydroxylate small alkanes in engineered hosts.

TI  == growth enhancement of effective microorganisms for bioremediation of crude oil contaminated waters.
AB  == the bioremediation of polluted groundwater, wastewater aeration pond and biopond  sites was investigated using bacteria isolated from these sites located at the oil refinery terengganu malaysia. out of 62 isolates, only 16 isolates from groundwater (8) and wastewater aeration pond (3) and biopond (5) were chosen based on growth medium containing 1% (v/v) tapis crude oil. only four isolates; acinetobacter faecalis, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas putida and neisseria elongata showed percentage biodegradation of crude oil more than 50% after 5 days using mineral salts medium (msm). the effect of physical parameters (temperature, ph and agitation) on growth by all four strains showed a maximum growth in msm medium with 1% tapis crude oil at 37 degrees c with ph 7 and agitation of 130 rpm.

TI  == biotransformation of chloroaromatics: the impact of bioavailability and substrate specificity.
AB  == the effect of surfactants on the biodegradation of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene by an escherichia coli jmi09(mi) recombinant strain, carrying a gene cluster containing the genes for benzene dioxygenase, cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida ml2, has been investigated. we observed that the efficiency of the benzene dioxygenase catalyzed conversions to cis-dihydrodiols depends on the balance among real substrate specificity, bioavailability, and toxicity effects of highly concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons. the utilization of non ionic surfactants makes it possible to partly overcome the limiting step of biodegradation processes for scarcely water  soluble hydrocarbons hindered by their limited bioavailability.furthermore the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and the extradiol catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which in the presently analyzed biodegradative pathway should further degrade the pollutants, are known, the first to be selectively specific for the (lr,2r)-dihydrodiol derivative which is not produced by the benzene dioxygenase,  the second, to be dead-end inhibited by the corresponding chlorinated catechois.  in the present example this results in the accumulation of the corresponding chlorinated cis-dihydrodiols which can be useful for asymmetric synthesis.on the  other hand the practical utilization of the system for bioremediation purposes requires the efficient conversion of the chlorinated catechols by specific intradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenases, the crystal structures of some of these last enzymes are currently under analysis in our laboratory to understand the structuralfunctional correlations. preliminary data show overall structures similar to the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from acinetobacter sp. adp1 thus suggesting that the substrate specificity differences are mainly related to subtle differences in the catalytic site.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamase detection: comparative evaluation of double-disk synergy versus combined disk tests for imp-, gim-, sim-, spm-, or vim-producing isolates.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing isolates is a challenge to routine microbiology laboratories, since there are no standardized methods for detecting such isolates. the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of different phenotypic methods to detect mbl production among pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterobacterial isolates, including gim, imp, sim, spm, and vim variants. a total of 46 genetically unrelated pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacterial strains producing distinct mbls were tested. nineteen strains were included as negative controls. the inhibition of bacterial growth and beta-lactam hydrolysis caused by mbl inhibitors (imbl) also were evaluated. the isolates were tested for mbl production by both a double-disk synergy test (ddst) and a combined disk assay (cd) using imipenem and ceftazidime as substrates in combination with distinct imbl. one hundred percent sensitivity and specificity were achieved by ddst using 2-mercaptopropionic acid in combination with ceftazidime and imipenem for the detection of mbl production among p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter species isolates, respectively. the cd test showed the same results for detecting mbl-producing enterobacteria by combining imipenem and edta, with a 5.0-mm-breakpoint increase in the size of the inhibition zone. our results indicate that both phenotypic methods to detect mbl-producing isolates should be  based on the genera to be tested, regardless of the enzyme produced by such isolates, as well as on the local prevalence of mbl producers.

TI  == the acinetobacter sp. chnb promoter together with its cognate positive regulator  chnr is an attractive new candidate for metabolic engineering applications in bacteria.
AB  == over the last 10 years there has been an extremely fast development in the global characterization of bacteria at the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels. to further explore and apply these complex data sets there is  now a need for new biological tools that can be used to test or verify hypotheses generated on the basis of all the new information. here, we report the integration of an expression cassette based on the acinetobacter sp. chnb promoter and its cognate positive regulator chnr gene into a replicon derived from the broad-host-range plasmid rk2. cyclohexanone was found to be the most efficient inducer of this system in escherichia coli, using firefly luciferase as a reporter. to explore the potential of the system in another species, we show that the system can be used in combination with another similar expression cassette (pm/xyls) to control the monomer composition of the industrially widely  used exopolysaccharide alginate, produced by pseudomonas fluorescens.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == characterization of a pseudomonas putida rough variant evolved in a mixed-species biofilm with acinetobacter sp. strain c6.
AB  == genetic differentiation by natural selection is readily observed among microbial  populations, but a more comprehensive understanding of evolutionary forces, genetic causes, and resulting phenotypic advantages is not often sought. recently, a surface population of pseudomonas putida bacteria was shown to evolve rapidly by natural selection of better-adapted variants in a mixed-species biofilm consortium (s. k. hansen, p. b. rainey, j. a. haagensen, and s. molin, nature 445:533-536, 2007). adaptation was caused by mutations in a waph homolog (pp4943) involved in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. here we investigate further the biofilm physiology and the phenotypic characteristics of the selected p. putida rough colony variants. the coexistence of the p. putida population in a mixed-species biofilm with acinetobacter sp. strain c6 is dependent on the benzoate excreted from acinetobacter during the catabolism of benzyl alcohol, the sole carbon source. examination of biofilm development and the dynamics of the wild-type consortium revealed that the biofilm environment became oxygen limited, possibly with low oxygen concentrations around acinetobacter microcolonies. in contrast to p. putida wild-type cells, which readily dispersed from the mixed-species biofilm in response to oxygen starvation, the rough variant cells displayed a nondispersal phenotype. however, in monospecies biofilms proliferating on benzoate, the rough variant (like the wild-type population) dispersed in response to oxygen starvation. a key factor explaining this conditional, nondispersal phenotype is likely to be the acquired ability of the rough variant to coaggregate specifically with acinetobacter cells. we further show that the p. putida rough variant displayed enhanced production of a cellulose-like polymer as a consequence of the mutation in waph. the resulting phenotypic characteristics of the p. putida rough variant explain its enhanced fitness and ability to form tight structural associations with acinetobacter microcolonies.

TI  == biodegradation of 4-chloroaniline by bacteria enriched from soil.
AB  == 4-chloroaniline has been released into the environment due to extensive use in chemical industries and intensive agriculture; hence, it becomes one of the hazardous pollutants in the priority pollutant list. in this study, three gram-negative bacteria were enriched and isolated from agricultural soil as 4-chloroaniline-degrading bacteria. they were identified as acinetobacter baumannii ca2, pseudomonas putida ca16 and klebsiella sp. ca17. they were able to utilize 4-chloroaniline as a sole carbon and nitrogen source without stimulation  or cocultivation with aniline or another cosubstrate. the biodegradation in these bacteria was occurred via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway of which the activity of chlorocatechol 1, 2-dioxygenase was markedly induced. they grew well on 0.2-mm 4-chloroaniline exhibiting a 60-75% degradation efficiency and equimolar liberation of chloride. the isolates were able to survive in the presence of 4-chloroaniline at higher concentrations (up to 1.2 mm). 2-chloroaniline, 3-chloroaniline and aniline, but not 3, 4-dichloroaniline, were also growth substrates for these isolates. the results of cosubstrate supplementation illustrated the suitable conditions of each isolate to improve growth rate and 4-chloroaniline biodegradation efficiency. these results suggest that these isolates have a potential use for bioremediation of the site contaminated with 4-chloroaniline.

TI  == cyp153a6, a soluble p450 oxygenase catalyzing terminal-alkane hydroxylation.
AB  == the first and key step in alkane metabolism is the terminal hydroxylation of alkanes to 1-alkanols, a reaction catalyzed by a family of integral-membrane diiron enzymes related to pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkb, by a diverse group of methane, propane, and butane monooxygenases and by some membrane-bound cytochrome p450s. recently, a family of cytoplasmic p450 enzymes was identified in prokaryotes that allow their host to grow on aliphatic alkanes. one member of this family, cyp153a6 from mycobacterium sp. hxn-1500, hydroxylates medium-chain-length alkanes (c6 to c11) to 1-alkanols with a maximal turnover number of 70 min(-1) and has a regiospecificity of > or =95% for the terminal carbon atom position. spectroscopic binding studies showed that c6-to-c11 aliphatic alkanes bind in the active site with kd values varying from approximately 20 nm to 3.7 microm. longer alkanes bind more strongly than shorter alkanes, while the introduction of sterically hindering groups reduces the affinity. this suggests that the substrate-binding pocket is shaped such that linear alkanes are preferred. electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in the presence of the substrate showed the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex, which confirmed the binding of substrates observed in optical titrations. to rationalize the experimental observations on a molecular scale, homology modeling of cyp153a6 and docking of substrates were used to provide the first insight into structural features required for terminal alkane hydroxylation.

TI  == identification of anthranilate and benzoate metabolic operons of pseudomonas fluorescens and functional characterization of their promoter regions.
AB  == background: in an effort to identify alternate recombinant gene expression systems in pseudomonas fluorescens, we identified genes encoding two native metabolic pathways that were inducible with inexpensive compounds: the anthranilate operon (antabc) and the benzoate operon (benabcd). results: the antabc and benabcd operons were identified by homology to the acinetobacter sp. anthranilate operon and pseudomonas putida benzoate operon, and were confirmed to be regulated by anthranilate or benzoate, respectively. fusions of the putative promoter regions to the e. coli lacz gene were constructed to confirm inducible gene expression. each operon was found to be controlled by an arac family transcriptional activator, located immediately upstream of the first structural gene in each respective operon (antr or benr). conclusion: we have found the anthranilate and benzoate promoters to be useful for tightly controlling recombinant gene expression at both small (< 1 l) and large (20 l) fermentation scales.

TI  == construction of artificially structured microbial consortia (asmc) using dielectrophoresis: examining bacterial interactions via metabolic intermediates within environmental biofilms.
AB  == the construction of artificial biofilms with defined internal architectures is described. bacterial cells are suspended in a low conductivity medium, guided to  specific areas in a microelectrode array by dielectrophoresis (dep), and then immobilised using the flocculating agent poly(ethylenimine). multispecies biofilms can be constructed by introducing different species at different times.  the rapid construction of such biofilms with defined internal architectures provides, when combined with visual reporters of gene activity, a powerful new method for the investigation of the effects of the spatial organisation on interactions between bacterial species in biofilms. to demonstrate the utility of the technique as a method for investigating metabolic interactions in biofilms, aggregates were constructed from acinetobacter sp. c6 and pseudomonas putida::gfp. the acinetobacter degrades benzyl alcohol, overproducing benzoate, which in turn is consumed by the pseudomonas strain. the p. putida has a chromosomally expressed cassette encoding a gfp downstream of the promoter which  controls degradation of benzoate, making the interaction between the two strains  in the metabolism of benzyl alcohol visible by the production of green fluorescent protein (gfp). microscopic observation of the biofilms, including the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), confirmed that metabolic exchange occurred. in addition, it was observed that the bacteria appear to have  a preferred biofilm architecture, with p. putida in the bottom layer, and acinetobacter at the top.

TI  == enhanced biodegradation of phenol by a microbial consortium in a solid-liquid two phase partitioning bioreactor.
AB  == two phase partitioning bioreactors (tppbs) operate by partitioning toxic substrates to or from an aqueous, cell-containing phase by means of second immiscible phase. uptake of toxic substrates by the second phase effectively reduces their concentration within the aqueous phase to sub-inhibitory levels, and transfer of molecules between the phases to maintain equilibrium results in the continual feeding of substrate based on the metabolic demand of the microorganisms. conventionally, a single pure species of microorganism, and a pure organic solvent, have been used in tppbs. the present work has demonstrated  the benefits of using a mixed microbial population for the degradation of phenol  in a tppb that uses solid polymer beads (comprised of ethylene vinyl acetate, or  eva) as the second phase. polymer modification via an increase in vinyl acetate concentration was also shown to increase phenol uptake. microbial consortia were  isolated from three biological sources and, based on an evaluation of their kinetic performance, a superior consortium was chosen that offered improved degradation when compared to a pure strain of pseudomonas putida atcc 11172. the  new microbial consortium used within a tppb was capable of degrading high concentrations of phenol (approximately 2000 mg l(-1)), with decreased lag time (10 h) and increased specific rate of phenol degradation (0.71 g phenol g(1) cell h). investigation of the four-member consortium showed that it consisted of two pseudomonas sp., and two acinetobacter sp., and tests conducted upon the individual isolates, as well as paired organisms, confirmed the synergistic benefit of their existence within the consortium. the enhanced effects of the use of a microbial consortium now offer improved degradation of phenol, and open the  possibility of the degradation of multiple toxic substrates via a polymer-mediated tppb system.

TI  == genes involved in aniline degradation by delftia acidovorans strain 7n and its distribution in the natural environment.
AB  == aniline-degraders were isolated from activated sludge and environmental samples and classified into eight phylogenetic groups. seven groups were classified into  gram-negative bacteria, such as acidovorax sp., acinetobacter sp., delftia sp., comamonas sp., and pseudomonas sp., suggesting the possible dominance of gram-negative aniline-degraders in the environment. aniline degradative genes were cloned from d. acidovorans strain 7n, and the nucleotide sequence of the 8,039-bp fragment containing eight open reading frames was determined. their deduced amino acid sequences showed homologies to glutamine synthetase (gs)-like  protein, glutamine amidotransferase (ga)-like protein, large and small subunits of aniline dioxygenase, reductase, lysr-type regulator, small ferredoxin-like protein, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, suggesting a high similarity of this gene  cluster to those in p. putida strain ucc22 and acinetobacter sp. strain yaa. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing analyses of gs-like protein gene segments of other gram-negative bacteria suggested that gram-negative bacteria have aniline degradative gene that can be divided into two distinctive groups.

TI  == unique features revealed by the genome sequence of acinetobacter sp. adp1, a versatile and naturally transformation competent bacterium.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. strain adp1 is a nutritionally versatile soil bacterium closely related to representatives of the well-characterized pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. unlike these bacteria, the acinetobacter adp1 is highly competent for natural transformation which affords extraordinary convenience for  genetic manipulation. the circular chromosome of the acinetobacter adp1, presented here, encodes 3325 predicted coding sequences, of which 60% have been classified based on sequence similarity to other documented proteins. the close evolutionary proximity of acinetobacter and pseudomonas species, as judged by the sequences of their 16s rna genes and by the highest level of bidirectional best hits, contrasts with the extensive divergence in the gc content of their dna (40  versus 62%). the chromosomes also differ significantly in size, with the acinetobacter adp1 chromosome <60% of the length of the pseudomonas counterparts. genome analysis of the acinetobacter adp1 revealed genes for metabolic pathways involved in utilization of a large variety of compounds. almost all of these genes, with orthologs that are scattered in other species, are located in five major 'islands of catabolic diversity', now an apparent 'archipelago of catabolic diversity', within one-quarter of the overall genome. acinetobacter adp1 displays many features of other aerobic soil bacteria with metabolism oriented toward the  degradation of organic compounds found in their natural habitat. a distinguishing feature of this genome is the absence of a gene corresponding to pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that generally catalyzes the terminal step in conversion of carbohydrates to pyruvate for respiration by the citric acid cycle. this finding  supports the view that the cycle itself is centrally geared to the catabolic capabilities of this exceptionally versatile organism.

TI  == a survey of indigenous microbial hydrocarbon degradation genes in soils from antarctica and brazil.
AB  == total community dna from 29 noncontaminated soils and soils impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons and chloro-organics from antarctica and brazil were screened for the presence of nine catabolic genes, encoding alkane monooxygenase or aromatic dioxygenases, from known bacterial biodegradation pathways. specific primers and  probes targeting alkane monooxygenase genes were derived from pseudomonas putida  atcc 29347 (pp alkb), rhodococcus sp. strain q15 (rh alkb1, rh alkb2), and acinetobacter sp. adp-1 (ac alkm). in addition, primers and probes detecting aromatic dioxygenase genes were derived from p. putida atcc 17484 (ndob), p. putida f1 (todc1), p. putida atcc 33015 (xyle and cat23), and p. pseudoalcaligenes kf707 (bpha). the primers and probes were used to analyze total community dna extracts by using pcr and hybridization analysis. all the catabolic genes, except the ac alkm, were detected in contaminated and control soils from both geographic regions, with a higher frequency in the antarctic soils. the alkane monooxygenase genes, rh alkb1 and rh alkb2, were the most frequently detected alk genes in both regions, while pp alkb was not detected in brazil soils. genes encoding the aromatic dioxygenases toluene dioxygenase (todc1) and biphenyl dioxygenase (bpha) were the most frequently detected in antarctica, and  todc1 and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (cat23) were the most frequent in brazil soils. hybridization analysis confirmed the pcr results, indicating that the probes used had a high degree of homology to the genes detected in the soil extracts and were effective in detecting biodegradative potential in the indigenous microbial population.

TI  == characterization of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in contaminated and pristine alpine soils.
AB  == biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in cold environments, including alpine soils, is a result of indigenous cold-adapted microorganisms able to degrade these contaminants. in the present study, the prevalence of seven genotypes involved in the degradation of n-alkanes (pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkb; acinetobacter spp. alkm; rhodococcus spp. alkb1, and rhodococcus spp. alkb2), aromatic hydrocarbons (p. putida xyle), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (p.  putida ndob and mycobacterium sp. strain pyr-1 nida) was determined in 12 oil-contaminated (428 to 30,644 mg of total petroleum hydrocarbons [tph]/kg of soil) and 8 pristine alpine soils from tyrol (austria) by pcr hybridization analyses of total soil community dna, using oligonucleotide primers and dna probes specific for each genotype. the soils investigated were also analyzed for  various physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters, and statistical correlations between all parameters were determined. genotypes containing genes from gram-negative bacteria (p. putida alkb, xyle, and ndob and acinetobacter alkm) were detected to a significantly higher percentage in the contaminated (50  to 75%) than in the pristine (0 to 12.5%) soils, indicating that these organisms  had been enriched in soils following contamination. there was a highly significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) between the level of contamination and the number of genotypes containing genes from p. putida and acinetobacter sp. but no significant correlation between the tph content and the number of genotypes containing genes from gram-positive bacteria (rhodococcus alkb1 and alkb2 and mycobacterium nida). these genotypes were detected at a high frequency  in both contaminated (41.7 to 75%) and pristine (37.5 to 50%) soils, indicating that they are already present in substantial numbers before a contamination event. no correlation was found between the prevalence of hydrocarbon-degradative genotypes and biological activities (respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, lipase activity) or numbers of culturable hydrocarbon-degrading soil  microorganisms; there also was no correlation between the numbers of hydrocarbon  degraders and the contamination level. the measured biological activities showed  significant positive correlation with each other, with the organic matter content, and partially with the tph content and a significant negative correlation with the soil dry-mass content (p < 0.05 to 0.001).

TI  == prevalence of alkane monooxygenase genes in arctic and antarctic hydrocarbon-contaminated and pristine soils.
AB  == abstract the prevalence of four alkane monooxygenase genotypes (pseudomonas putida gpo1, pp alkb; rhodococcus sp. strain q15, rh alkb1 and rh alkb2; and acinetobacter sp. strain adp-1, ac alkm) in hydrocarbon-contaminated and pristine soils from the arctic and antarctica were determined by both culture-independent  (pcr hybridization analyses) and culture-dependent (colony hybridization analyses) molecular methods, using oligonucleotide primers and dna probes specific for each of the alk genotypes. pcr hybridization of total soil community dna detected the rhodococcal alkb genotypes in most of the contaminated (rh alkb1, 18/20 soils; rh alkb2, 13/20) and many pristine soils (rh alkb1, 9/10 soils; rh alkb2, 7/10), while pp alkb was generally detected in the contaminated  soils (15/20) but less often in pristine soils (5/10). ac alkm was rarely detected in the soils (1/30). the colony hybridization technique was used to determine the prevalence of each of the alk genes and determine their relative abundance in culturable cold-adapted (5 degrees c) and mesophilic populations (37 degrees c) from eight of the polar soils. the cold-adapted populations, in general, possessed relatively higher percentages of the rh alkb genotypes (rh alkb1, 1.9% (0.55); rh alkb2, 2.47% (0.89)), followed by the pp alkb (1.13% (0.50)), and then the ac alkm (0.53% (0.36)). the rh alkb1 genotype was clearly more prevalent in culturable cold-adapted bacteria (1.9% (0.55)) than in culturable mesophiles (0.41 (0.55)), suggesting that cold-adapted bacteria are the predominant organisms possessing this genotype. overall, these results indicated that (i) acinetobacter spp. are not predominant members of polar alkane degradative microbial communities, (ii) pseudomonas spp. may become enriched in polar soils following contamination events, and (iii) rhodococcus spp. may be the predominant alkane-degradative bacteria in both pristine and contaminated polar soils.

TI  == plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  == during evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that  in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not  cause an efficient gene expression. however, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35s promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) in bacteria. we therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from solanum tuberosum, nicotiana tabacum, camv, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a. rhizogenes  for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, a. tumefaciens, pseudomonas putida, and acinetobacter sp. bd413). to monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence  in the bacteria. heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. we then mapped the transcription start site caused by one  of the plant-specific promoters, the st-ls1 promoter from s. tuberosum, in these  bacterial species. the location of the mapped transcription start site indicated  that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. the recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial rna polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed  mutagenesis of the st-ls1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in e. coli. using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the st-ls1 promoter serving as -10 region in e. coli. the results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. this is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.

TI  == functional analysis of alkane hydroxylases from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we have cloned homologs of the pseudomonas putida gpo1 alkane hydroxylase from pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, pseudomonas fluorescens cha0, alcanivorax borkumensis ap1, mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, and prauserella rugosa nrrl b-2295. sequence comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the homologs is as low as 35%, and that the pseudomonas alkane hydroxylases are as distantly related to each other as to the remaining alkane hydroxylases. based on the observation that rubredoxin, an electron transfer component of the gpo1 alkane hydroxylase system, can be replaced by rubredoxins from other alkane hydroxylase systems, we have developed three recombinant host strains for the functional analysis of the novel alkane hydroxylase genes. two hosts, escherichia coli gec137 and p. putida gpo12, were equipped with pgec47 delta b, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on medium-chain-length alkanes (c(6) to c(12)), except a functional alkane hydroxylase. the third host was an alkb knockout derivative of p. fluorescens cha0, which is no longer able to grow on c(12) to c(16) alkanes. all alkane hydroxylase homologs, except the acinetobacter sp. adp1 alkm, allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on n-alkanes.

AB  == the aniline-assimilating bacterium acinetobacter lwoffii k24 has two cat gene clusters (cat1 and cat2). in this study, we completely sequenced 10-kb dna fragment of cat1 genes of a. lwoffii k24, which had been cloned in plasmid pcd1-1. sequence analysis revealed that the order of genes in the cat1 operon-containing gene cluster was orf porin, catr1, catb1c1a1d, orf1, and orf2.  two orfs located immediately downstream catd were most similar with two orfs in cat gene cluster of acinetobacter calcoaceticus adp1 but the gene structure of catr1b1c1a1 was closest to that found in frateurua sp. ana-18 or pseudomonas putida prs2000. cata1 gene product was significantly overexpressed and detected in sds-page when four cat1 genes (catb1c1a1d) were placed under the control of a  lac promoter in puc118 while overexpressions of other cat genes were accomplished under the control of a lac promoter in pet vector system. all gene products were  verified by n-terminal amino acid sequencing. gel retardation assay revealed that the putative regulatory gene activator catr1 for the catb1c1a1 operon could bind  the promoter region of catb2 as well as catb1, suggesting that transcription of catb1 or catb2 might be controlled by the putative gene activator catr1. however, the promoter regions of cata1 and cata2 were found to have no affinity with catr1.

AB  == we have developed highly degenerate oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of genes related to the pseudomonas oleovorans gpo1  and acinetobacter sp. adp1 alkane hydroxylases, based on a number of highly conserved sequence motifs. in all gram-negative and in two out of three gram-positive strains able to grow on medium- (c6-c11) or long-chain n-alkanes (c12-c16), pcr products of the expected size were obtained. the pcr fragments were cloned and sequenced and found to encode peptides with 43.2-93.8% sequence identity to the corresponding fragment of the p. oleovorans gpo1 alkane hydroxylase. strains that were unable to grow on n-alkanes did not yield pcr products with homology to alkane hydroxylase genes. the alkane hydroxylase genes  of acinetobacter calcoaceticus eb104 and pseudomonas putida p1 were cloned using  the pcr products as probes. the two genes allow an alkane hydroxylase-negative mutant of acinetobacter sp. adp1 and an escherichia coli recombinant containing all p. oleovorans alk genes except alkb, respectively, to grow on n-alkanes, showing that the cloned genes do indeed encode alkane hydroxylases.

TI  == the chlorobenzoate dioxygenase genes of burkholderia sp. strain nk8 involved in the catabolism of chlorobenzoates.
AB  == burkholderia sp. nk8 grows abundantly on 3-chlorobenzoate (3cb),4-chlorobenzoate  (4cb) and benzoate. the genes encoding the oxidation of (chloro)benzoates (cbeabcd) and catechol (cata, catbc), the lysr-type regulatory gene cber and the  gene cbee with unknown function, all of which form a single cluster in nk8, were  cloned and analysed. the protein sequence of chlorobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase (cbeabc) is 50-65% identical to the benzoate dioxygenase (benabc) of acinetobacter sp. adp1, toluate dioxygenase (xylxyz) of the tol plasmid pww0 and  2-halobenzoate dioxygenase (cbdabc) of burkholderia cepacia 2cbs. disruption of the cbea gene resulted in the simultaneous loss of the ability to grow on benzoate and monochlorobenzoates, indicating the involvement of the cbeabcd genes in the degradation of these aromatics. the cbeabcd genes are preceded by cata, the gene for catechol dioxygenase. lacz transcriptional fusion studies in pseudomonas putida showed that cata and cbea are co-expressed under the positive  control of cber, a lysr-type transcriptional regulatory gene. the cbea::lacz transcriptional fusion studies showed that the inducers of the genes are 3cb, 4cb, benzoate and probably cis,cis-muconate. on the other hand, 2-chlorobenzoate  (2cb) did not activate the expression of the genes. the chlorobenzoate dioxygenase was able to transform 2cb, 3cb, 4cb and benzoate at considerable rates. 2cb yielded both catechol and 3-chlorocatechol (3cc), and 3cb gave rise to 4-chlorocatechol and 3cc as the major and minor intermediate products, respectively, indicating that the nk8 dioxygenase lacks absolute regiospecificity. the absence of growth of nk8 on 2cb, despite its considerable degradation activity against 2cb, is apparently due to the inability of cber to recognize 2cb as an inducer of the expression of the cbe genes.

AB  == an arylketone monooxygenase was purified from pseudomonas putida jd1 by ion exchange and affinity chromatography. it had the characteristics of a baeyer-villiger-type monooxygenase and converted its substrate, 4-hydroxyacetophenone, into 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate with the consumption of one molecule of oxygen and oxidation of one molecule of nadph per molecule of substrate. the enzyme was a monomer with an m(r) of about 70,000 and contained one molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad). the enzyme was specific for nadph as the electron donor, and spectral studies showed rapid reduction of the fad by nadph but not by nadh. other arylketones were substrates, including acetophenone and 4-hydroxypropiophenone, which were converted into phenyl acetate and 4-hydroxyphenyl propionate, respectively. the enzyme displayed michaelis-menten kinetics with apparent k(m) values of 47 microm for 4-hydroxyacetophenone, 384 microm for acetophenone, and 23 microm for 4-hydroxypropiophenone. the apparent k(m) value for nadph with 4-hydroxyacetophenone as substrate was 17.5 microm. the n-terminal sequence did not show any similarity to other proteins, but an internal sequence was very similar to part of the proposed nadph binding site in the baeyer-villiger monooxygenase cyclohexanone monooxygenase from an acinetobacter sp.

TI  == exogenous isolation of antibiotic resistance plasmids from piggery manure slurries reveals a high prevalence and diversity of incq-like plasmids.
AB  == antibiotic resistance plasmids were exogenously isolated in biparental matings with piggery manure bacteria as plasmid donors in escherichia coli cv601 and pseudomonas putida uwc1 recipients. surprisingly, incq-like plasmids were detected by dot blot hybridization with an incq oriv probe in several p. putida uwc1 transconjugants. the capture of incq-like plasmids in biparental matings indicates not only their high prevalence in manure slurries but also the presence of efficiently mobilizing plasmids. in order to elucidate unusual hybridization data (weak or no hybridization with incq repb or incq orit probes) four incq-like plasmids (pie1107, pie1115, pie1120, and pie1130), each representing a different  ecorv restriction pattern, were selected for a more thorough plasmid characterization after transfer into e. coli k-12 strain dh5alpha by transformation. the characterization of the incq-like plasmids revealed an astonishingly high diversity with regard to phenotypic and genotypic properties.  four different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were found to be conferred by the incq-like plasmids. the plasmids could be mobilized by the rp4 derivative  pth10 into acinetobacter sp., ralstonia eutropha, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and  p. putida, but they showed diverse patterns of stability under nonselective growth conditions in different host backgrounds. incompatibility testing and pcr  analysis clearly revealed at least two different types of incq-like plasmids. pcr amplification of total dna extracted directly from different manure samples and other environments indicated the prevalence of both types of incq plasmids in manure, sewage, and farm soil. these findings suggest that incq plasmids play an  important role in disseminating antibiotic resistance genes.

TI  == positive selection for mutations affecting bioconversion of aromatic compounds in agrobacterium tumefaciens: analysis of spontaneous mutations in the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase gene.
AB  == a positive selection method for mutations affecting bioconversion of aromatic compounds was applied to a mutant strain of agrobacterium tumefaciens a348. the nucleotide sequence of the a348 pcahgb genes, which encode protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (pcahg) and beta-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase (pcab) for the first two steps in catabolism of the diphenolic protocatechuate, was determined. an omega element was introduced into the pcab gene of a348, creating  strain ado2077. in the presence of phenolic compounds that can serve as carbon sources, growth of ado2077 is inhibited due to accumulation of the tricarboxylate intermediate. the toxic effect, previously described for acinetobacter sp., affords a powerful selection for suppressor mutations in genes required for upstream catabolic steps. by monitoring loss of the marker in pcab, it was possible to determine that the formation of deletions was minimal compared to results obtained with acinetobacter sp. thus, the tricarboxylic acid trick in and of itself does not appear to select for large deletion mutations. the power of the selection was demonstrated by targeting the pcahg genes of a. tumefaciens for spontaneous mutation. sixteen strains carrying putative second-site mutations in  pcah or -g were subjected to sequence analysis. all single-site events, their mutations revealed no particular bias toward multibase deletions or unusual patterns: five (-1) frameshifts, one (+1) frameshift, one tandem duplication of 88 bp, one deletion of 92 bp, one nonsense mutation, and seven missense mutations. pcahg is considered to be the prototypical ferric intradiol dioxygenase. the missense mutations served to corroborate the significance of active site amino acid residues deduced from crystal structures of pcahg from pseudomonas putida and acinetobacter sp. as well as of residues in other parts of the enzyme.

TI  == the physiological contribution of acinetobacter pcak, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of vank.
AB  == vank is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with pcak, benk, and muck, contributes to aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1. vank and pcak have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype  associated with inactivation of its homolog. furthermore, vank pcak double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. this provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. previous studies of aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. by using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. in this study, the overlapping specificity of the vank and pcak permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vank or pcak. spontaneous mutations identified in vank include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a g6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of vank structure and function. preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated pcr mutagenesis in one vank mutant gave results similar to those using lacy, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. the selection for transport mutants described here for acinetobacter may also be applicable to pseudomonas putida, where the pcak permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.

TI  == expression of alkane hydroxylase from acinetobacter sp. strain adp1 is induced by a broad range of n-alkanes and requires the transcriptional activator alkr.
AB  == in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1, alkane degradation depends on at least five essential genes. rubab and xcpr are constitutively transcribed. here we describe  inducible transcription of alkm, which strictly depends on the presence of the transcriptional activator alkr. alkr itself is expressed at a low level, while a  chromosomally located alkm::lacz fusion is inducible by middle-chain-length alkanes from heptane to undecane, which do not support growth of adp1, and by long-chain-length alkanes from dodecane to octadecane, which are used as sources  of carbon and energy. the putative alkm substrate 1-dodecene is also an effective inducer. products of alkane hydroxylase activity like 1-dodecanol prevent induction of alkm expression. alkm is expressed only in stationary phase, suggesting its dependence on at least one other regulatory mechanism.

TI  == establishment of new genetic traits in a microbial biofilm community.
AB  == conjugational transfer of the tol plasmid (pwwo) was analyzed in a flow chamber biofilm community engaged in benzyl alcohol degradation. the community consisted  of three species, pseudomonas putida ri, acinetobacter sp. strain c6, and an unidentified isolate, d8. only p. putida ri could act as a recipient for the tol  plasmid. cells carrying a chromosomally integrated laciq gene and a lacp-gfp-tagged version of the tol plasmid were introduced as donor strains in the biofilm community after its formation. the occurrence of plasmid-carrying cells was analyzed by viable-count-based enumeration of donors and transconjugants. upon transfer of the plasmids to the recipient cells, expression of green fluorescence was activated as a result of zygotic induction of the gfp gene. this allowed a direct in situ identification of cells receiving the gfp-tagged version of the tol plasmid. our data suggest that the frequency of horizontal plasmid transfer was low, and growth (vertical transfer) of the recipient strain was the major cause of plasmid establishment in the biofilm community. employment of scanning confocal laser microscopy on fixed biofilms, combined with simultaneous identification of p. putida cells and transconjugants  by 16s rrna hybridization and expression of green fluorescence, showed that transconjugants were always associated with noninfected p. putida ri recipient microcolonies. pure colonies of transconjugants were never observed, indicating that proliferation of transconjugant cells preferentially took place on preexisting p. putida ri microcolonies in the biofilm.

AB  == microbial communities growing in laboratory-based flow chambers were investigated in order to study compartmentalization of specific gene expression. among the community members studied, the focus was in particular on pseudomonas putida and  a strain of an acinetobacter sp., and the genes studied are involved in the biodegradation of toluene and related aromatic compounds. the upper-pathway promoter (pu) and the meta-pathway promoter (pm) from the tol plasmid were fused  independently to the gene coding for the green fluorescent protein (gfp), and expression from these promoters was studied in p. putida, which was a dominant community member. biofilms were cultured in flow chambers, which in combination with scanning confocal laser microscopy allowed direct monitoring of promoter activity with single-cell spatial resolution. expression from the pu promoter was homogeneously induced by benzyl alcohol in both community and pure-culture biofilms, while the pm promoter was induced in the mixed community but not in a pure-culture biofilm. by sequentially adding community members, induction of pm was shown to be a consequence of direct metabolic interactions between an acinetobacter species and p. putida. furthermore, in fixed biofilm samples organism identity was determined and gene expression was visualized at the same time by combining gfp expression with in situ hybridization with fluorescence-labeled 16s rrna targeting probes. this combination of techniques is a powerful approach for investigating structure-function relationships in microbial communities.

TI  == ptim3, a plasmid delivery vector for a transposon-based inducible marker gene system in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == ptim3 is a suicide plasmid vector for the delivery of a transposition defective derivative of tn5, expressing inducible mercury resistance (hgr) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (c23o) activity, to a range of gram-negative microorganisms. ptim3 was constructed by a four-stage process from pnmm1, a derivative of psup5011 containing a modified tn5 where antibiotic-resistance determinants have  been replaced by the mer operon of tn501 and tdnc (encoding a c23o). in ptim3, tdnc is fused to merd, to bring c23o expression under the control of the mer operon. ptim3 was introduced into acinetobacter calcoaceticus, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, and alcaligenes sp., and isolates were examined for loss of the vector, which is not stably maintained outside the enterobacteriaceae, but retention of the tn5 derivative. transposition results from the action of a vector-encoded tn5 transposase (tnp) on the ends of is50l and is50r retained in the tn5 construct. between 10 and 20% of the isolates contained a single copy of the defective transposon in the chromosome. a single-copy isolate of each species was assayed for inducibility of c23o activity using hgcl2 as inducer. the increase in c230 activity was linear with increasing  hgcl2 concentration and ranged between 10- and 20-fold at 20 micrograms/ml. hgr and c23o+ phenotypes were found to be stably maintained in each of the isolates following 40 generations of nonselective growth. a novel aspect of this marker gene system is that isolates can be recovered on nonselective medium and then sprayed with a catechol/hgcl2 mixture for rapid colorimetric detection. the system can be applied to the tracking of genetically modified microorganisms in the environment and has the advantage that their detection may be achieved cheaply and without the use of sophisticated equipment.

TI  == variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the gram-negative bacteria aeromonas sp., acinetobacter acetoaceticus, agrobacterium tumefaciens, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, vibrio parahaemolyticus yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli, was analyzed by hplc. in all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. a wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. the contribution of ld-a2pm-a2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides.  muropeptides with the dipeptides lys-lys or arg-lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.

TI  == inability of muconate cycloisomerases to cause dehalogenation during conversion of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate.
AB  == the conversion of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate by muconate cycloisomerase from pseudomonas putida prs2000 yielded two products which by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were identified as 2-chloro- and 5-chloromuconolactone. high-pressure liquid chromatography analyses showed the same compounds to be formed also by muconate cycloisomerases from acinetobacter calcoaceticus adp1 and pseudomonas sp. strain b13. during 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate turnover by the enzyme from p. putida, 2-chloromuconolactone initially was the major product. after prolonged incubation, however, 5-chloromuconolactone dominated in the resulting equilibrium. in contrast to previous assumptions, both chloromuconolactones were found to be stable at physiological ph. since the chloromuconate cycloisomerases of pseudomonas sp. strain b13 and alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 have been shown previously to produce the trans-dienelactone (trans-4-carboxymethylene-but-2-en-4-olide) from 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate, they  must have evolved the capability to cleave the carbon-chlorine bond during their  divergence from normal muconate cycloisomerases.

TI  == conjugational transfer of recombinant dna in cultures and in soils: host range of pseudomonas putida tol plasmids.
AB  == recombinant tol plasmid pwwo-eb62 allows pseudomonas putida to grow on p-ethylbenzoate. this plasmid can be transferred to other microorganisms, and its catabolic functions for the metabolism of alkylbenzoates are expressed in a limited number of gram-negative bacteria, including members of pseudomonad rrna group i and escherichia coli. transfer of the recombinant plasmid to erwinia chrysanthemi was observed, but transconjugants failed to grow on alkylbenzoates because they lost catabolic functions. pseudomonads belonging to rrna groups ii,  iii, and iv, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and alcaligenes sp. could not act as recipients for tol, either because the plasmid was not transferred or because it  was not stably maintained. the frequency of transfer of pwwo-eb62 from p. putida  as a donor to pseudomonads belonging to rrna group i was on the order of 1 to 10(-2) transconjugant per recipient, while the frequency of intergeneric transfer ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-7) transconjugant per recipient. the profile of potential hosts was conserved when the donor bacterium was escherichia coli or erwinia chrysanthemi instead of p. putida. no intergeneric gene transfer of the recombinant tol plasmid was observed in soils; however, intraspecies transfer did take place. intraspecies transfer of tol in soils was affected by the type of soil used, the initial inoculum size, and the presence of chemicals that could affect the survival of the donor or recipient bacteria.

TI  == cloning of a carbofuran hydrolase gene from achromobacter sp. strain wm111 and its expression in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a 14-kilobase-pair (kbp) ecori dna fragment that encodes an enzyme capable of rapid hydrolysis of n-methylcarbamate insecticides (carbofuran hydrolase) was cloned from carbofuran-degrading achromobacter sp. strain wm111. when used to probe southern blots containing plasmid and total dnas from wm111, this 14-kbp fragment hybridized strongly to a 14-kbp ecori fragment from the greater than 100-kbp plasmid harbored by this strain but weakly to ecori-digested total dna from achromobacter sp. strain wm111, indicating that the gene for n-methylcarbamate degradation (mcd) is plasmid encoded. further subcloning localized the mcd gene on a 3-kbp scai-clai fragment. there was little or no expression of this gene in the alternative gram-negative hosts pseudomonas putida, alcaligenes eutrophus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and achromobacter pestifer. western blotting (immunoblotting) of the protein products produced by low-level expression in p. putida confirmed that this 3-kbp fragment encodes the  two 70+-kilodalton protein products seen in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified carbofuran hydrolase.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == occurrence, transfer and mobilization in epilithic strains of acinetobacter of mercury-resistance plasmids capable of transformation.
AB  == a 7.8 kb plasmid (pqm17) encoding mercury resistance was isolated from two epilithic strains of acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the plasmid had a broad host range when mobilized by rp1, transferring into pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and chromobacterium sp. with frequencies ranging from 5.3 x 10(-9) to 4.6 x 10(-4) per recipient. the plasmid  could be transferred into a. calcoaceticus bd413 using intact cells of donor and  recipient bacteria (i.e. natural transformation) and there was a broad temperature optimum (14-37 degrees c) for transformation. transformation was as efficient in liquid matings as on plates but there was no effect of ph in the range 5.6-7.9. maximum transformation frequencies were obtained after 24 h on agar plates containing 3.5-10 g c 1-1 with donor to recipient ratios ranging from 6 to 415.

TI  == dienelactone hydrolase from pseudomonas sp. strain b13.
AB  == dienelactone hydrolase (ec 3.1.1.45) catalyzes the conversion of cis- or trans-4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olide (dienelactone) to maleylacetate. an approximately 24-fold purification from extracts of 3-chlorobenzoate-grown pseudomonas sp. strain b13 yielded a homogeneous preparation of the enzyme. the purified enzyme crystallized readily and proved to be a monomer with a molecular  weight of about 30,000. each dienelactone hydrolase molecule contains two cysteinyl side chains. one of these was readily titrated by stoichiometric amounts of p-chloromercuribenzoate, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme; the  inactivation could be reversed by the addition of dithiothreitol. the other cysteinyl side chain appeared to be protected in the native protein against chemical reaction with p-chloromercuribenzoate. the properties of sulfhydryl side chains in dienelactone hydrolase resembled those that have been characterized for bacterial 4-carboxymethylbut-3-en-4-olide (enol-lactone) hydrolases (ec 3.1.1.24), which also are monomers with molecular weights of about 30,000. the amino acid composition of the dienelactone hydrolase resembled the amino acid composition of enol-lactone hydrolase from pseudomonas putida, and alignment of the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of the dienelactone hydrolase with the corresponding sequence of an acinetobacter calcoaceticus enol-lactone hydrolase revealed sequence identity at 8 of the 28 positions. these observations foster the hypothesis that the lactone hydrolases share a common ancestor. the lactone hydrolases differed in one significant property: the kcat of dienelactone hydrolase was 1,800 min-1, an order of magnitude below the kcat observed with enol-lactone hydrolases. the relatively low catalytic activity of dienelactone hydrolase may demand its production at the high levels observed for induced cultures of pseudomonas sp. strain b13.

TI  == intergeneric evolutionary homology revealed by the study of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from azotobacter vinelandii.
AB  == protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (ec 1.13.1.3) was purified to homogeneity from extracts of azotobacter vinelandii. the molecular weight of the oligomeric protein was estimated to be 510 000 by gel filtration and 480 000 by ultracentrifugation. the oligomer appears to be formed by association of equal amounts of nonidentical subunits which were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to have respective molecular weights of 23 300 and 25 250. ten gram-atoms of iron was associated with each mol of oligomer. therefore, the enzyme appears to be a decamer with the structure 10(alpha beta fe). t-he amino acid composition of azotobacter protocatechuate oxygenase closely resembles the amino acid compositions of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases from pseudomonas aeruginosa and thiobacillus sp. these proteins from p. aeruginosa and p. putida are known to be formed by association of nonidentical subunits of a physical size similar to the subunits of the azotobacter enzyme. furthermore, antisera prepared against the azotobacter oxygenase cross-reacted strongly with the isofunctional enzymes from the two fluorescent pseudomonas species. a weak immunological cross-reaction was observed when the antisera were tested against protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the results favor the conclusion that the bacterial protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases were derived from  a common ancestral protein.
