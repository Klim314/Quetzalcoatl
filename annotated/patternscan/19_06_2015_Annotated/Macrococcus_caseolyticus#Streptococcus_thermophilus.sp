TI  == study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

TI  == diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna analysis.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in sicily (italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. the latter included pcr, reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes (rdna). bacterial and lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the v6 to v8 and v1 to  v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene, respectively. dgge profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. cloning and sequencing of rdna amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab), including species of leuconostoc, lactococcus lactis, and macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. other thermophilic lab, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. comparison of the rrna-derived patterns obtained by rt-pcr to the rdna dgge patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. identification of cultivated lab isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16s rdna clone libraries, with the significant exception of the lactobacillus delbrueckii  species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. the present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.
