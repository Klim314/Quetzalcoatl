TI  == destructive effects of butyrate on the cell envelope of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == helicobacter pylori can be found in the oral cavity and is mostly detected by the use of pcr techniques. growth of h. pylori is influenced by various factors in the mouth, such as the oral microflora, saliva and other antimicrobial substances, all of which make colonization of the oral cavity by h. pylori difficult. in the present study, we analysed the effect of the cell supernatant of a representative periodontal bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis on h. pylori and found that the cell supernatant destroyed the h. pylori cell envelope. as p.  gingivalis produces butyric acid, we focused our research on the effects of butyrate and found that it significantly inhibited the growth of h. pylori. h. pylori cytoplasmic proteins and dna were detected in the extracellular environment after treatment with butyrate, suggesting that the integrity of the cell envelope was compromised and indicating that butyrate has a bactericidal effect on h. pylori. in addition, levels of extracellular h. pylori dna increased following treatment with the cell supernatant of butyric acid-producing bacteria, indicating that the cell supernatant also has a bactericidal effect and that this may be due to its butyric acid content. in conclusion, butyric acid-producing bacteria may play a role in affecting h. pylori colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  == classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. solid phase cytometry (spc) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a  membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained  only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. however, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling  of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. we have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium bifermentans, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas canoris, p. gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (c. butyricum, c. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. however, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, c. tyrobutyricum. for vegetative cells of all strains, plots of spc versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that spc consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.
