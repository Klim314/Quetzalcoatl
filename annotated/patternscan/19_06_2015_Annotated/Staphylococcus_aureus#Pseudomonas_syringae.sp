TI  == draft genome sequence analysis of a pseudomonas putida w15oct28 strain with antagonistic activity to gram-positive and pseudomonas sp. pathogens.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. p. putida w15oct28, isolated from a stream in brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for p. putida. the active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against p. aeruginosa. analysis of the draft genome  confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. one cluster  of ten genes was detected, comprising a nad-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl coa dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a rnd efflux pump. p.  putida w15oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding tonb-dependent receptors,  conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. one unique feature of w15oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type iv secretion, and several genes for type vi secretion and their vgrg effectors.

TI  == antibacterial activities of ligaria cuneifolia and jodina rhombifolia leaf extracts against phytopathogenic and clinical bacteria.
AB  == six plant extracts prepared from ligaria cuneifolia and jodina rhombifolia were screened for their potential antimicrobial activities against phytopathogens and  clinically standard reference bacterial strains. bioautography and broth microdilution methods were used to study samples antibacterial activities against 7 bacterial strains. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of samples were attained. an antibacterial activity guided isolation and identification of active compounds was carried out  for l. cuneifolia methanolic extract (lcme). both methanolic and aqueous extracts from l. cuneifolia showed inhibitory activities against phytopathogenic bacteria, with mics ranging from 2.5 to 156 mug ml(-1) for lcme and 5 mg ml(-1) for the aqueous extract. none of the three j. rhombifolia extracts showed significant antibacterial activities against phytopathogenic strains (mic > 5 mg ml(-1)), except for the aqueous extracts against pseudomonas syringae (mic = 312 mug ml(-1)). only lcme showed bactericidal activities against phytopathogenic strains (mbcs = 78 mug ml(-1)). the lcme exhibited significant inhibitory activity against reference clinical strains: escherichia coli (mic = 156 mug ml(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (mic = 78 mug ml(-1), mbc = 312 mug ml(-1)). lcme active compounds were identified as flavonol mono and diglycosides, and gallic acid. the antibacterial activity of purified compounds was also evaluated. a synergistic effect against s. aureus was found between gallic acid and a quercetin glycoside. hence, anti-phytopathogenic bacteria potential compounds isolated from l. cuneifolia could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in plants.

TI  == structural and morphological investigations of beta-cyclodextrin-coated silver nanoparticles.
AB  == this paper describes the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using an aqueous silver nitrate solution in the presence of glucose as a reducing agent, sodium hydroxide as a reaction catalyst and beta-cd as a stabilizer. the structure and the morphology associated to the stabilizing layer around the silver nanoparticles were investigated. raman spectroscopy confirmed the nanoparticle surface modification by beta-cd, demonstrating the interaction between the beta-cd rim hydroxyl groups and the agnp surface. transmission electron microscopy images showed an average 28.0nm diameter pseudo-spherical nanoparticles. apart from this, a novel characterization of the beta-cd layer surrounding the nanoparticles was carried out by using complementary analytical electron microscopy based on electron spectroscopy imaging in the transmission microscope. mapping images revealed the presence of carbon and oxygen, demonstrating the existence of a uniform and interacting beta-cd layer covering the nanoparticles. the antibacterial activity was also investigated and the beta-cd-coated silver nanoparticles showed a promising bactericidal activity against the microorganism escherichia coli.

TI  == synthesis of steroidal and nonsteroidal vicinal heterocyclic alcohols, n-(1-cycloalkenyl)heterocycles and their antibacterial studies.
AB  == a solvent free steroidal and nonsteroidal epoxide ring opening reaction by nitrogen containing heterocycles under microwave irradiation is described. some of the epoxide ring opening compounds were converted to their corresponding n-(1-cycloalkenyl)heterocycles via an acid catalyzed dehydration reaction. the antimicrobial activities of the epoxide ring opening compounds and n-(1-cycloalkenyl)heterocyclic compounds were tested by agar diffusion assay. compounds 6, 9-12, 24 and 27 showed moderate inhibition against the growth of pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas syringae, bacillus subtilis, proteus vulgaris and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == arabidopsis lysin-motif proteins lym1 lym3 cerk1 mediate bacterial peptidoglycan  sensing and immunity to bacterial infection.
AB  == recognition of microbial patterns by host pattern recognition receptors is a key  step in immune activation in multicellular eukaryotes. peptidoglycans (pgns) are  major components of bacterial cell walls that possess immunity-stimulating activities in metazoans and plants. here we show that pgn sensing and immunity to bacterial infection in arabidopsis thaliana requires three lysin-motif (lysm) domain proteins. lym1 and lym3 are plasma membrane proteins that physically interact with pgns and mediate arabidopsis sensitivity to structurally different  pgns from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. lym1 and lym3 mutants lack pgn-induced changes in transcriptome activity patterns, but respond to fungus-derived chitin, a pattern structurally related to pgns, in a wild-type manner. notably, lym1, lym3, and lym3 lym1 mutant genotypes exhibit supersusceptibility to infection with virulent pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato dc3000. defects in basal immunity in lym3 lym1 double mutants resemble those observed in lym1 and lym3 single mutants, suggesting that both proteins are part of the same recognition system. we further show that deletion of cerk1, a lysm receptor kinase that had previously been implicated in chitin perception and immunity to fungal infection in arabidopsis, phenocopies defects observed in lym1 and lym3 mutants, such as peptidoglycan insensitivity and enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection. altogether, our findings suggest that plants share with metazoans the ability to recognize bacterial pgns. however, as arabidopsis lysm domain proteins lym1, lym3, and cerk1 form a pgn recognition system that is unrelated to metazoan pgn receptors, we propose that lineage-specific pgn perception systems have arisen through convergent evolution.

TI  == cis-antisense rna, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  == a substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. however, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. the transcriptomes of bacteria as different as helicobacter pylori, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, mycoplasma pneumoniae, sinorhizobium meliloti, geobacter sulfurreducens, vibrio cholerae, chlamydia trachomatis, pseudomonas syringae, and staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense rna (asrna) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. bacterial asrnas share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory rnas, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. here, we review recent publications indicating that asrnas occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asrna actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. emerging functional data suggest that asrnas in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. thus, the functional impact  of asrnas should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic  bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.

TI  == genetic and functional diversity among the antagonistic potential fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from tea rhizosphere.
AB  == twenty-five fluorescent pseudomonads from rhizospheric soil of six tea gardens in four district of upper assam, india were isolated and screened for antagonistic activity against fungal pathogens such as fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani (for), fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri (foc), fusarium semitectum (fs), and rhizoctonia solani (rs); and bacterial pathogens-staphylococcus aureus (sa), escherichia coli (ec), and klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). most of the isolates exhibited strong antagonistic activity against the fungal pathogens and gram-positive bacterium i.e. staphylococcus aureus. productions of siderophore, salicylic acid (sa), hydrogen cyanide (hcn), and cell wall-degrading enzyme (chitinase) were studied to observe the possible mechanisms of antagonistic activity of the isolates. correlation between the antagonistic potentiality of some isolates and their levels of production of siderophore, salicylic acid, and  hydrogen cyanide was observed. out of the 25 isolates, antibiotic-coding genes, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (dapg) and pyoluteorin (plt) were detected in the isolates, pf12 and pf373, respectively. genetic diversity of these fluorescent pseudomonads were analyzed with reference to four strains of pseudomonas fluorescens nicm 2099(t), p. aeruginosa mtcc 2582(t), p. aureofaciens nicm 2026(t), and p. syringae mtcc 673(t). 16s rdna-rflp analysis of these isolates using three tetra cutter restriction enzymes (haeiii, alui and mspi) revealed two distinct clusters. cluster a comprised only two isolates pf141 and 24-pfm3, and cluster b comprised 23 isolates along with four reference strains.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and the mic values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, candida albicans, candida glabrata, alternaria alternata, ascochyta rabiei, aspergillus niger, fusarium culmorum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium oxysporum, fusarium solani, and penicillium notatum. there  was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, salmonella typhimurium, alternaria citri, alternaria tenuissima, and gaeumannomyces graminis. chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.

TI  == production of an engineered killer peptide in nicotiana benthamiana by using a potato virus x expression system.
AB  == the decapeptide killer peptide (kp) derived from the sequence of a single-chain,  anti-idiotypic antibody acting as a functional internal image of a microbicidal,  broad-spectrum yeast killer toxin (kt) was shown to exert a strong microbicidal activity against human pathogens. with the aim to exploit this peptide to confer  resistance to plant pathogens, we assayed its antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi. synthetic kp exhibited antimicrobial activity in vitro towards pseudomonas syringae, erwinia carotovora, botrytis cinerea, and fusarium oxysporum. kp was also expressed in plants by using a potato virus x (pvx)-derived vector as a fusion to the viral coat protein, yielding chimeric virus particles (cvps) displaying the heterologous peptide. purified cvps showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against the above-mentioned plant pathogens and human pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. moreover, in vivo assays designed to challenge kp-expressing plants (as cvps) with pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci showed enhanced resistance to bacterial attack. the results indicate that the pvx-based  display system is a high-yield, rapid, and efficient method to produce and evaluate antimicrobial peptides in plants, representing a milestone for the large-scale production of high-added-value peptides through molecular farming. moreover, kp is a promising molecule to be stably engineered in plants to confer  broad-spectrum resistance to phytopathogens.

TI  == pseudotrienic acids a and b, two bioactive metabolites from pseudomonas sp. mf381-iods.
AB  == bioassay-guided fractionation of the liquid culture broth of pseudomonas sp. mf381-iods yielded two new antimicrobial substances, identified as (2e,4e,6e)-9-[((2s,3r)-3-hydroxy-4-{[(3e,5e,7rs)-7-hydroxy-4-methylhexadeca-3,5-d ienoyl]amino}-2-methylbutanoyl)amino]nona-2,4,6-trienoic acid and the tetradeca equivalent, named pseudotrienic acids a (1) and b (2), respectively. the compounds are prone to lactone formation, and their structures suggest them to be derived from ring opening of a macrolide. pseudotrienic acids a and b inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus (mic 70 microg/ml) and pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (mic 70 microg/ml). two known antimicrobial compounds, the polyketide 2,3-deepoxy-2,3-didehydrorhizoxin (3) and the tryptophan-derived pyrrolnitrin (4), were also identified.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == antibacterial activity of seed proteins of robinia pseudoacacia.
AB  == a low molecular weight cationic peptide was isolated from robinia pseudoacacia seed and tested in vitro against seven bacteria (corynebacterium michiganense, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, pseudomonas syringae pv syringae, xanthomonas campestris pv campestris, and escherichia coli). the peptide inhibited the growth of the tested strains. the effective concentrations required for 50% inhibition of bacterial growth ranged between 20 and 120 microg ml(-1) protein. s. aureus was found to be the most sensitive strain, however, e. coli was not affected much when compared with others. reduction of antibacterial activity of the peptide with cacl2 addition into the growth medium was also observed.

TI  == anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity of some herbal remedies from tanzania.
AB  == plants are not only important to the millions of people to whom traditional medicine serves as the only opportunity for health care and to those who use plants for various purposes in their daily lives, but also as a source of new pharmaceuticals. during interviews with the pare people from northeastern tanzania, 29 plants that are used for medicinal purposes as well as 41 plants used for non-medicinal purposes were reported. six medicinally used plants were selected for bioactivity analysis. extracts of coccinia adoensis, cineraria grandiflora, pavonia urens, marattia fraxinea, clutia abyssinica var. usambarica, and vangueria infausta were made using ethyl acetate, methanol, cold water and boiling water. the antimicrobial activity was tested on candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium culmorum, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas syringae, and erwinia amylovora. all plants showed activity against several test  organisms.

TI  == innate immunity in arabidopsis thaliana: lipopolysaccharides activate nitric oxide synthase (nos) and induce defense genes.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) are cell-surface components of gram-negative bacteria and are microbe-/pathogen-associated molecular patterns in animal pathosystems. as for plants, the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction in response to lps are not known. here, we show that arabidopsis thaliana reacts to lps with a rapid burst of no, a hallmark of innate immunity in animals. fifteen lps preparations (among them burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and erwinia carotovora) as well as lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive staphylococcus aureus were found  to trigger no production in suspension-cultured arabidopsis cells as well as in leaves. no was detected by confocal laser-scanning microscopy in conjunction with the fluorophore 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate, by electron paramagnetic resonance, and by a no synthase (nos) assay. the source of  no was addressed by using t-dna insertion lines. interestingly, lps did not activate the pathogen-inducible varp nos, but atnos1, a distinct nos previously associated with hormonal signaling in plants. a prominent feature of lps treatment was activation of defense genes, which proved to be mediated by no. northern analyses and transcription profiling by using dna microarrays revealed induction of defense-associated genes both locally and systemically. finally, atnos1 mutants showed dramatic susceptibility to the pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000. in sum, perception of lps and induction of nos contribute toward the activation of plant defense responses.
