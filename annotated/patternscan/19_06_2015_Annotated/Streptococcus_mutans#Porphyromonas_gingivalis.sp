TI  == kinetic-dependent killing of oral pathogens with nitric oxide.
AB  == nitric oxide (no)-releasing silica nanoparticles were synthesized via the co-condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate with aminosilanes and subsequent conversion of secondary amines to n-diazeniumdiolate no donors. a series of ~150  nm no-releasing particles with different no totals and release kinetics (i.e., half-lives) were achieved by altering both the identity and mol% composition of the aminosilane precursors. independent of identical 2 h no-release totals, enhanced antibacterial action was observed against the periodontopathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis with extended  no-release kinetics at ph 7.4. negligible bactericidal effect was observed against cariogenic streptococcus mutans at ph 7.4, even when using no-releasing silica particles with greater no-release totals. however, antibacterial activity  was observed against s. mutans at lower ph (6.4). this result was attributed to more rapid proton-initiated decomposition of the n-diazeniumdiolate no donors and greater no-release payloads. the data suggest a differential sensitivity to no between cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria with implications for the future development of no-releasing oral care therapeutics.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial metabolic activity is associated with the onset and progression mechanisms of oral biofilm-mediated disease; however, at present no method to monitor bacterial metabolism exists, especially for periodontopathic bacteria. therefore, we aimed to establish a novel method for monitoring the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella  intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), as well as streptococcus mutans (sm) for comparison. the method is based on the dye resazurin, which is converted to the fluorescent molecule resorufin by reducing molecules derived from bacterial metabolism. additionally, the effects of antimicrobial substances on bacterial metabolic activity were evaluated using this method. when bacterial suspensions were incubated with tryptone, glutamate, aspartate or glucose in the  presence of resazurin, the fluorescence intensity increased over time by these bacterial metabolic reactions, indicating that this method can be used to monitor the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria. chlorhexidine showed the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 15-49mug/ml for tryptone metabolism by pg, pi, and fn, and 7.1-18mug/ml for glucose metabolism by pi and sm. the ic50s for cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate were 0.8-2.1 and 28-44mug/ml, respectively for all bacteria examined. fluoride had no effect except the ic50 of 640mug/ml for sm, while minocycline hydrochloride had no effect on any of the bacteria. the present study established the method for real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, and the method might be useful for evaluating the effects of antimicrobial substances on the bacterial metabolic activity.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activity and osteoblast-like cell viability of tin, zrn and (ti1-xzrx)n coating on titanium.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial activity and osteoblast-like cell viability according to the ratio of titanium nitride and zirconium nitride coating on commercially pure titanium using an arc ion plating  system. materials and methods: polished titanium surfaces were used as controls.  surface topography was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and surface roughness was measured using a two-dimensional contact stylus profilometer. antibacterial activity was evaluated against streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis with the colony-forming unit assay. cell compatibility,  mrna expression, and morphology related to human osteoblast-like cells (mg-63) on the coated specimens were determined by the xtt assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. results: the number of s. mutans colonies on the tin, zrn and (ti1-xzrx)n coated surface decreased significantly compared to those on the non-coated titanium surface (p<0.05). conclusion: the number of p. gingivalis colonies on all surfaces showed no significant differences. tin, zrn and (ti1-xzrx)n coated titanium showed antibacterial activity against s. mutans related to initial biofilm formation but not p. gingivalis associated with advanced periimplantitis, and did not influence osteoblast-like cell viability.

TI  == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and  stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented  on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the  whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an  increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI  == bactericidal effect of extracts and metabolites of robinia pseudoacacia l. on streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis causing dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases.
AB  == the mouth cavity hosts many types of anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus  mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, which cause periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of extracts of robinia pseudoacacia and its different fractions, as well as some of its natural compounds against oral pathogens and a  nonpathogenic reference bacteria, escherichia coli. the antibacterial activity of the crude extract and the solvent fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol) of r. pseudoacacia were evaluated against s. mutans, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha by standard micro-assay procedure using conventional sterile polystyrene microplates. the results showed that the crude extract was more active against p. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) than against s. mutans (73% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/ml. the chloroform and hexane fractions were active  against p. gingivalis, with 91 and 97% growth inhibition, respectively, at 0.2 mg/ml. none of seven natural compounds found in r. pseudoacacia exerted an antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis; however, fisetin and myricetin at 8 microg/ml inhibited the growth of s. mutans by 81% and 86%, respectively. the crude extract of r. pseudoacacia possesses bioactive compounds that could completely control the growth of p. gingivalis. the antibiotic activities of the  hexane and chloroform fractions suggest that the active compounds are hydrophobic in nature. the results indicate the effectiveness of the plant in clinical applications for the treatment of dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases and its potential use as disinfectant for various surgical and orthodontic appliances.

TI  == antibacterial and osteogenic stem cell differentiation properties of photoinduced tio2 nanoparticle-decorated tio2 nanotubes.
AB  == aim: to improve the antibacterial and mammalian cell compatibility properties of  titania nanotubes (tnts) anodized into titanium (ti). materials & methods: 3-8-nm tio2 nanoparticles were decorated on the surface and inside tnt (tnt-tio2) through a hydrothermal method. after uv light treatment, two types of oral bacteria and stem cells were cultured on the samples to determine antibacterial and compatibility properties. results: tio2 nanoparticles increased the surface area and photocatalysis of tnts. based on the photocatalysis effect and prolonged photo-induced wettability, the numbers of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas  gingivalis were lower on the surface of tnt-tio2 than pure ti and tnts after the  first 7 days. specifically, for s. mutans, the glycosytransferase (gtf) genes were downregulated 0.1-0.2-fold on tnt-tio2. due to the different topography and  high surface energy of tnt-tio2, stem cells also showed improved osteogenic functions on tnt-tio2. conclusion: in this study, we demonstrated for the first time improved antibacterial properties and, at the same time, greater stem cell osteogenic capacity when decorating tnts with nanosized tio2 particles, which may significantly improve orthopedic and dental implant efficacy.

TI  == evaluation of the co-existence of the red fluorescent plaque bacteria p. gingivalis with s. gordonii and s. mutans in white spot lesion formation during orthodontic treatment.
AB  == background: early detection of white spot lesions (wsls) around brackets during orthodontic treatment is important for treatment and prevention. but it is unclear whether red fluorescent plaque (rfp) bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and its co-existence with streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii has any significant influence on this. therefore the role of this bacterial co existence  and wsls formation during one year of fixed orthodontic therapy was evaluated. methods: fourteen 12 to 22 year old (mean 15+/-3 years) consecutive patients attending the university of liverpool dental hospital were recruited for this study. quantitative light-induced fluorescence (qlf) was used to identify rfp and enamel demineralisation, respectively, on anterior labial surfaces before and after placement of fixed orthodontic appliances. bacterial composition was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) following nested pcr amplification of the 16s rrna v2-v3 hypervariable region. results: wsls were recorded on 4.2% of tooth surfaces and wsl development was not associated with rfp bacteria p. gingivalis presence. differences in rfp bacteria p. gingivalis presence with s. mutans and s. gordonii, were observed before and after appliance placement. intra subject changes in plaque flora between visits were not significantly associated with wsl development (p>0.05). however, dgge profiles indicated that apart from s. mutans, s. gordonii might also have a role in human  enamel demineralisation. conclusions: fixed orthodontic brackets in adolescents may play a role in altering bacterial composition around brackets during orthodontic treatment and it is plausible that s. gordonii also have a role in human enamel demineralisation. combinatorial approach of qlf technology and dgge  may be useful in determining bacterial composition during orthodontic therapy which could inform clinical interventions.

TI  == killing dental pathogens using antibacterial graphene oxide.
AB  == dental caries and periodontal diseases have a close relationship with microbes such as streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. graphene oxide (go), as the derivative of graphene, plays an important role in many areas including biology and medicine. in particular, it has been known as a promising antimicrobial nanomaterial. in this study, we focused on the antimicrobial property of go against dental pathogens. with the utilization of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) reduced test, colony forming units (cfu) counting, growth curve observation, live/dead fluorescent staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), we found go  nanosheets were highly effective in inhibiting the growth of dental pathogens. transmission electron microscopy (tem) images revealed that the cell wall and membrane of bacteria lost their integrity and the intracellular contents leaked out after they were treated by go. therefore, go nanosheets would be an effective antibacterial material against dental pathogens and the potential applications in dental care and therapy are promising.

TI  == anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB  == background: anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. highlight: studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed  microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter (wolinella) rectus and other campylobacter species, and tannerella (bacteroides) forsythia. anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with  gingivitis, and added selenomonas noxia and filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. porphyromonas gingivalis and t. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. the dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. the major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species. anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. the pcr-based cloning approach, however, underestimated actinobacteria compared with culture. only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low ph acid agar. while the major caries-associated species was s. mutans, a new species, scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. higher counts of s. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. conclusion: in periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of pcr with standard primers that underestimate detection of actinobacteria.

TI  == scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB  == individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. therefore, it is surprising so  little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, klebsiella pneumonia, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using  a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and  c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration  equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p.  gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of naf/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. the optimal naf/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using  bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic s. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. in addition, the naf/arginine combination synergistically reduced s. mutans but enriched s. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. more importantly, the optimal combination of naf/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe p. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.

TI  == the oral microbiome and the immunobiology of periodontal disease and caries.
AB  == the composition of the oral microbiome differs from one intraoral site to another, reflecting in part the host response and immune capacity at each site. by focusing on two major oral infections, periodontal disease and caries, new principles of disease emerge. periodontal disease affects the soft tissues and bone that support the teeth. caries is a unique infection of the dental hard tissues. the initiation of both diseases is marked by an increase in the complexity of the microbiome. in periodontitis, pathobionts and keystone pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis appear in greater proportion than in health. as a keystone pathogen, p. gingivalis impairs host immune responses and appears necessary but not sufficient to cause periodontitis. historically, dental caries had been causally linked to streptococcus mutans. contemporary microbiome  studies now indicate that singular pathogens are not obvious in either caries or  periodontitis. both diseases appear to result from a perturbation among relatively minor constituents in local microbial communities resulting in dysbiosis. emergent consortia of the minor members of the respective microbiomes  act synergistically to stress the ability of the host to respond and protect. in  periodontal disease, host protection first occurs at the level of innate gingival epithelial immunity. secretory iga antibody and other salivary antimicrobial systems also act against periodontopathic and cariogenic consortia. when the gingival immune response is impaired, periodontal tissue pathology results when matrix metalloproteinases are released from neutrophils and t cells mediate alveolar bone loss. in caries, several species are acidogenic and aciduric and appear to work synergistically to promote demineralization of the enamel and dentin. whereas technically possible, particularly for caries, vaccines are unlikely to be commercialized in the near future because of the low morbidity of  caries and periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of pineapple extract (bromelain) on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease resulting in the destruction of periodontal tissues. various treatment modalities have been tried in the form  of mechanical therapy and surgical therapy. antimicrobial agents have been used as a monotherapy and as an adjunct with mechanical debridement. various plant extracts have been used as antibacterial agents. pineapple extract (bromelian) is one such agent. hence this study was conducted to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. the aim was to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. materials and methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of bromelain was tested on isolated strains of streptococcus  mutans, enterococcus fecalis aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) using serial dilution broth method. results: s. mutans showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 2 mg/ml as compared to e fecalis (31.25 mg/ml) while pgingivalis showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 4.15 mg/ml as compared to aa (16.6 mg/ml). conclusion: bromelain exerts an antibacterial effect against potent periodontal pathogens; hence, it may be used as an antibacterial agent. however, further trial has to be conducted to validate this result.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lemongrass oil against oral malodour micro-organisms and  the pilot study of safety and efficacy of lemongrass mouthrinse on oral malodour.
AB  == aims: lemongrass oil (lg) has been reported as being effective against bacteria embedded within the biofilm. the aims of this study were to investigate antimicrobial activity against common odourigenic micro-organisms, the safety and efficacy of lg mouthrinse on oral malodour in healthy volunteers. methods and results: antimicrobial activity of lg mouthrinse was examined against common odourigenic micro-organisms using broth microdilution assay and the disc diffusion method. a randomised double-blind clinical study was performed in 20 healthy volunteers. volatile sulphur compounds (vscs) level was measured using a  halimeter on day 0 and day 8 in each volunteer. the results showed that lg mouthrinse was effective against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc43718  and porphyromonas gingivalis w50 but less effective against streptococcus mutans  atcc 25175. in addition, the mouthrinse significantly reduced vscs on day 8. conclusions: lg mouthrinse was able to reduce oral malodour and appeared to be safe. the overall satisfaction of the mouthrinse was acceptable. however, the spiciness and taste of the mouthrinse need to be improved. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that the lg mouthrinse significantly reduced oral malodour. this mouthrinse would be another alternative mouthrinse choice for prevention of malodour, plaque and gingivitis.

TI  == screening and development of dna aptamers specific to several oral pathogens.
AB  == aptamers are composed of single-stranded oilgonucleotides that can selectively bind desired molecules. it has been reported that rna or dna could act as not only a genetic messenger but also a catalyst in metabolic pathways. rna aptamers  (average sizes 40-50 bp) are smaller than antibodies and have strong binding capacities to target molecules, similar to antigen-antibody interactions. once an aptamer was selected, it can be readily produced in large quantities at low cost. the objectives of this study are to screen and develop aptamers specific to oral  pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and streptococcus mutans. the bacterial cell pellet was fixed with formaldehyde as a  target molecule for the screening of aptamers. the selex method was used for the  screening of aptamers and a modified western blot analysis was used to verify their specificities. through selex, 40 kinds of aptamers were selected and the specificity of the aptamers to the bacterial cells was confirmed by modified western blot analysis. through the selex method, 40 aptamers that specifically bind to oral pathogens were screened and isolated. the aptamers showed possibility as effective candidates for the detection agents of oral infections.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of antrodia camphorata extracts against oral bacteria.
AB  == antrodia camphorata (a. camphorata) is a unique, endemic and extremely rare mushroom species native to taiwan, and both crude extracts of and purified chemical compounds from a. camphorata have been reported to have a variety of significant beneficial effects, such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity. however, reports on the effects of a. camphorata against dental pathogens have been limited. oral health is now recognized as important for overall general health, including conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) are the most common bacteria associated  with dental plaque and periodontopathic diseases, respectively. thus, our study examined the ability of five various crude extracts of a. camphorata to inhibit the growth of dental bacteria and anti-adherence in vitro. among the extracts, the ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts exhibited the lowest mics against p. gingivalis and s. mutans (mic = 4 approximately 16 microg/ml). the mic of the aqueous extract was greater than 2048 microg/ml against both p. gingivalis and s. mutans. in vitro adherence of s. mutans was significantly inhibited by the addition of either the ethyl acetate extract or chloroform extract (mic = 16 approximately 24 microg/ml), while the ethanol extract (mic = 32 approximately 64 microg/ml) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity. based on the result of this study, the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of a. camphorata may be good candidates for oral hygiene agents to control dental caries and periodontopathic  conditions.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == synthesis of tio2 nanotubes with zno nanoparticles to achieve antibacterial properties and stem cell compatibility.
AB  == to endow titanium (ti) with antibacterial properties, different concentrations of zinc oxide (zno) nanoparticles were decorated on anodized titanium dioxide (tio2) nanotubes by a simple hydrothermal treatment method. the particle sizes of zno, which were evenly distributed and tightly adherent to the walls of the ti nanotubes, ranged from 20-50 nm. results from this study showed that zn was released from the tio2 nanotubes in a constant, slow, and biologically inspired manner. importantly, the results showed that the zno decorated tio2 nanotubular samples inhibited streptococcus mutants and porphyromonas gingivalis growth compared to control unmodified ti samples. specifically, s. mutants and p. gingivalis growth were both reduced 45-85% on the zno decorated ti samples compared to ti controls after 7 days of culture. when examining the mechanism of  action, it has been further found for the first time that the zno decorated ti samples inhibited the expression of streptococcus mutans bacterial adhesion genes. lastly, the results showed that the same samples which decreased bacterial growth the most (0.015 m precursor zn(no3)2 samples) did not inhibit mesenchymal  stem cell growth compared to ti controls for up to 7 days. in summary, results from this study showed that compared to plain tio2 nanotubes, tio2 decorated with 0.015 m zno provided unprecedented antibacterial properties while maintaining the stem cell proliferation capacity necessary for enhancing the use of ti in numerous medical applications, particularly in dentistry.

TI  == susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans to antibacterial effect from mammea americana.
AB  == the development of periodontal disease and dental caries is influenced by several factors, such as microorganisms of bacterial biofilm or commensal bacteria in the mouth. these microorganisms trigger inflammatory and immune responses in the host. currently, medicinal plants are treatment options for these oral diseases.  mammea americana extracts have reported antimicrobial effects against several microorganisms. nevertheless, this effect is unknown against oral bacteria. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of m. americana extract against porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. for  this, an experimental study was conducted. ethanolic extract was obtained from seeds of m. americana (one oil phase and one ethanolic phase). the strains of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were exposed to this extract to evaluate its antibacterial effect. antibacterial activity was observed with the two phases of m. americana extract on p. gingivalis and s. mutans with lower mics (minimum inhibitory concentration). also, bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity was detected against s. mutans, depending on the concentration of the extract, while on m. americana extract presented only bacteriostatic activity against p. gingivalis. these findings provide important and promising information allowing for further exploration in the future.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine o on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

TI  == [efficacy of taurine haloamines and chlorhexidine against selected oral microbiome species].
AB  == introduction: uncontrolled bacteria of dental plaque generate formation of oral biofilm located on teeth and subgingival surfaces. it may induce local inflammation (gingivitis) with further development of periodontal diseases. a variety of oral bacteria such as streptococcus mutans and porhyromonas gingivalis are involved in pathogenesis of dental carries and periodontitis. very often bacterial infections are associated with candidiasis (candida albicans). chlorhexidine (chx) is the most commonly used antiseptic in dentistry due to its  strong antibacterial activity and capacity to reduce the accumulation of oral biofilms. however, other antiseptics, especially endodontic irrigants, are still  tested to improve their preventive and therapeutic effects in oral cavity infections. in this in vitro study we have compared antimicrobial activity of chx with that of taurine chloramine (tauc1) and taurine bromamine (taubr), natural taurine derivatives with known antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: antimicrobial activity of chx, tauc1 and taubr was tested by incubation  of the compounds with s. mutans, p gingivalis and c. albicans. the agents were incubated in low (105/ml) and high (108/ml) density microbe suspensions, related  to early and late biofilm infections, respectively. in some experiments bacteria  were incubated with a combination of chx + naocl and chx + taubr. mic was determined by the pour-plate method. results: chx showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against all tested pathogens. on the contrary, tauc1 was the weakest antiseptics used without effect on the growth of c. albicans. taubr at non-cytotoxic concentrations inhibited the growth of s. mutans and p gingivalis with slight effect on the low density c. albicans. all tested agents showed weaker antiseptic properties in the presence of serum. moreover, we have shown that interactions between chx and sodium hypochlorite (naoc1), the main endodontic irrigant, but not between chx and taubr,resulted in precipitation. therefore, it may restrict their simultaneous application in root canal treatment. however, in spite of this unwanted reaction, the mixture of chx with naocl kills pathogens more effectively then chx alone. conclusions: the results confirmed chx exceptional potential as primary antiseptic in dentistry, especially in prevention and treatment of dental carries, periodontal diseases and mouth candidiasis. moreover, our study shows that taubr may be used alternatively or in combination with chx in killing of oral pathogens, due to its strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  == aim: the study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. materials and methods: total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. the samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. once dispersed samples were taken and gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. results: the result showed microflora common in all types, gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. in normal children gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. conclusion: by the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and  also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.

TI  == inhibitory effect of dodonaea viscosa var. angustifolia on the virulence properties of the oral pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == aim. this study investigated the effect of dodonaea viscosa var. angustifolia (dva) on the virulence properties of cariogenic streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis implicated in periodontal diseases. methods. s. mutans was cultured in tryptone broth containing a crude leaf extract of dva for 16 hours, and the ph was measured after 10, 12, 14, and 16 h. biofilms of s. mutans  were grown on glass slides for 48 hours and exposed to plant extract for 30 minutes; the adherent cells were reincubated and the ph was measured at various time intervals. minimum bactericidal concentration of the extracts against the four periodontal pathogens was determined. the effect of the subinhibitory concentration of plant extract on the production of proteinases by p. gingivalis  was also evaluated. results. dva had no effect on acid production by s. mutans biofilms; however, it significantly inhibited acid production in planktonic cells. periodontal pathogens were completely eliminated at low concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 0.02 mg/ml of crude plant extracts. at subinhibitory concentrations, dva significantly reduced arg-gingipain (24%) and lys-gingipain (53%) production by p. gingivalis (p </= 0.01). conclusions. these results suggest that dva has the potential to be used to control oral infections including dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. background data: photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy  kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. materials and methods: to address the focused question, "does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" pubmed/medline((r)) and google scholar databases were explored. original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. letters to the editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. results: photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis. photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. conclusions: photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.

TI  == synergistic effect of proanthocyanidin on the bactericidal action of the photolysis of h2o2.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the hydroxyl radical generation system by  the photolysis of h2o2 in combination with proanthocyanidin, which refers to a group of polyphenolic compounds, was examined. bactericidal activity of photo-irradiated h2o2 at 405 nm against streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen of dental caries, was augmented in the presence of proanthocyanidin, whose bactericidal effect by itself was very poor, in a concentration-dependent manner. this combination was also proven effective against porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen of periodontitis. it is speculated that h2o2, generated from photo-irradiated proanthocyanidin around the bacterial cells, is photolyzed to the hydroxyl radical, which would in turn affect the membrane structure and function of the bacterial cells, resulting in augmented sensitivity of bacterial  cells to the disinfection system utilizing the photolysis of h2o2. the present study suggests that the combination of h2o2 and proanthocyanidin works synergistically to kill bacteria when photo-irradiated.

TI  == effects of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and treatment efficacy.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and antimicrobial treatment efficacy. materials and methods: titanium disks with low-roughness pickled surfaces and with moderately rough sandblasted, acid-etched surfaces were used as substrata. streptococcus mutans biofilms (1 and 3 days old) and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms (3 days old) were grown on the two types of substrata and then treated with 0.2% chlorhexidine. biofilm viability was evaluated by a resazurin metabolism assay and by sonication-colony-forming unit counts. results: surface roughness had no influence on the amount of biofilm formation by s mutans or p gingivalis in this in vitro biofilm model. however, it strongly affected the treatment efficacy of chlorhexidine on the biofilms formed by both species. higher roughness resulted in lower efficacy. furthermore, treatment efficacy was  significantly reduced in older biofilms. conclusion: a moderately roughened surface did not enhance biofilm formation but reduced treatment efficacy of the biofilms. this finding indicates that efforts should be directed toward optimizing implant surface properties for effective antimicrobial treatment without compromising osseointegration.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == an in vitro study of alginate oligomer therapies on oral biofilms.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro effect of a novel, oligosaccharide nanomedicine oligog against oral pathogen-related biofilms, both alone and in the presence of the conventional anti-bacterial agent triclosan, was evaluated. methods: the effect of oligog+/-triclosan was assessed against established streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms by bacterial counts and image analysis using live/dead((r)) staining and atomic force microscopy (afm). the effect of triclosan and oligog surface pre-treatments on bacterial attachment to titanium and polymethylmethacrylate was also studied. results: oligog potentiated the antimicrobial effect of triclosan, particularly when used in combination at 0.3%  against s. mutans grown in artificial saliva. oligog was less effective against established p. gingivalis biofilms. however, attachment of p. gingivalis, to titanium in particular, was significantly reduced after surface pre-treatment with oligog and triclosan at 0.01% when compared to controls. light microscopy and afm showed that oligog was biocidal to p. gingivalis, but not s. mutans. conclusions: oligog and triclosan when used in combination produced an enhanced antimicrobial effect against two important oral pathogens and reduced bacterial attachment to dental materials such as titanium, even at reduced triclosan concentrations. whilst the use of triclosan against oral bacteria has been widely documented, its synergistic use with oligog described here, has not previously been reported. the use of lower concentrations of triclosan, if used in combination therapy with oligog, could have environmental benefits. clinical importance: the potentiation of antimicrobial agents by naturally occurring oligomers such as oligog may represent a novel, safe adjunct to conventional oral hygiene and periodontal therapy. the ability of oligog to inhibit the growth and  impair bacterial adherence highlights its potential in the management of peri-implantitis.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == mobile microbiome: oral bacteria in extra-oral infections and inflammation.
AB  == the link between oral infections and adverse systemic conditions has attracted much attention in the research community. several mechanisms have been proposed,  including spread of the oral infection due to transient bacteremia resulting in bacterial colonization in extra-oral sites, systemic injury by free toxins of oral pathogens, and systemic inflammation caused by soluble antigens of oral pathogens. mounting evidence supports a major role of the systemic spread of oral commensals and pathogens to distant body sites causing extra-oral infections and  inflammation. we review here the most recent findings on systemic infections and  inflammation complicated by oral bacteria, including cardiovascular disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and  colorectal cancer, respiratory tract infections, and organ inflammations and abscesses. the recently identified virulence mechanisms of oral species fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and campylobacter rectus are also reviewed. a pattern emerges indicating that only select subtype(s) of a given species, e.g., f. nucleatum subspecies animalis and  polymorphum and s. mutans non-c serotypes, are prone to extra-oral translocation. these findings advocate the importance of identification and quantification of potential pathogens at the subtype levels for accurate prediction of disease potential.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == biological interaction between sasa senanensis rehder leaf extract and toothpaste ingredients.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity of alkaline extract of the leaves of sasa senanensis rehder (se). in order to manufacture an se-containing toothpaste for combating oral diseases, we investigated the possible interaction between the candidate ingredients of toothpaste: se, isopropyl methylphenol (ipmp, antibacterial agent) and charcoal prepared from sasa senanensis rehder. materials and methods: cell viability of mock-infected, hiv-infected and uv-irradiated cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. superoxide radical scavenging activity was determined by electron-spin resonance  spectroscopy. antibacterial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and streptococcus mutans atcc25175 was determined by the turbidity assay. results: exposure to less than 50% se or less than 0.31 mm ipmp for 10 min scarcely damaged human cultured gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. both se and ipmp showed bi-modal action, stimulating the bacterial growth at lower concentrations, but synergistically inhibiting it at higher concentrations. addition of extremely high concentrations of charcoal enhanced both anti-hiv and  anti-uv activity of se. conclusion: practically, addition of charcoal may not be  recommendable, since one or two orders higher concentrations of charcoal as compared with se, are required to achieve the synergistic effect for anti-hiv and anti-uv activity. rather, addition of about one tenth of the amount of ipmp may be recommendable for enhancing the antibacterial activity.

TI  == association between selected oral pathogens and gastric precancerous lesions.
AB  == we examined whether colonization of selected oral pathogens is associated with gastric precancerous lesions in a cross-sectional study. a total of 119 participants were included, of which 37 were cases of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, or dysplasia. an oral examination was performed to measure periodontal indices. plaque and saliva samples were tested with real-time quantitative pcr for dna levels of pathogens related to periodontal disease (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and dental caries (streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus). there were no consistent associations between dna levels of selected bacterial species and gastric precancerous lesions, although an elevated but non-significant odds ratio (or) for gastric precancerous lesions was observed in relation to increasing colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans (or = 1.36 for one standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval = 0.87-2.12), p. gingivalis (or = 1.12, 0.67-1.88) and t. denticola (or = 1.34, 0.83-2.12) measured in plaque. to assess the influence of specific long-term infection, stratified analyses by levels of periodontal indices were conducted. a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with gastric precancerous lesions (or = 2.51, 1.13-5.56) among those with >/= median of percent tooth sites with pd >/= 3 mm, compared with no association among those below the median (or = 0.86, 0.43-1.72). a significantly stronger relationship was observed between the  cumulative bacterial burden score of periodontal disease-related pathogens and gastric precancerous lesions among those with higher versus lower levels of periodontal disease indices (p-values for interactions: 0.03-0.06). among individuals with periodontal disease, high levels of colonization of periodontal  pathogens are associated with an increased risk of gastric precancerous lesions.

TI  == putative down-stream signaling molecule of gtpase in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a strict anaerobic bacterium mainly responsible for periodontal disease in oral cavity. putative gtpase gene (pgp) of this bacterium  was cloned and its recombinant protein (rpgp) was produced in escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of sgp that is a gtp-binding protein of streptococcus mutans, putative gtpase amino acid sequence was deduced in the data base of genome sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis. a 900-bp pcr fragment was amplified with p. gingivalis genomic dna as a template and cloned into e. coli jm 109. then pgp was transferred into pqe-30 expression vector to make pqe-pgp for production of rpgr. this protein was produced and purified by ni-nta affinity column chromatography. anti-pgp antibody was also produced in sprague dawley rats. using westernblot analysis with this antibody, it was confirmed that the rpgp produced in e. coli was identical to that of donor strain. furthermore, by southernblot analysis it was revealed that the pgp was originated from p. gingivalis. by immunoprecipitation with anti-pgp antibody and n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis it was found that pgp was able to bind to acetate kinase,  which was reported to be a secondary signaling-molecule in anaerobic microorganisms. therefore, these results imply that p. gingivalis produces putative gtpase and this protein might play a potential role in signaling pathway in oral biofilm formation.

AB  == salivary cortisol is commonly used as a clinical biomarker of endocrine status and also as a marker of psychosocial stress. annexin-a1 (anxa1) is an anti-inflammatory protein whose expression is modulated by glucocorticoids. our principal objectives were to (i) detect the presence of and (ii) measure anxa1 protein in whole human saliva and to (iii) investigate whether salivary cortisol  and anxa1 are correlated in healthy humans. a total of 37 healthy participants (male and female) were used in the study. saliva was collected using salivette tubes. salivary cortisol and anxa1 protein were sampled at between 3 and 6 time points over 24h and measured for cortisol and anxa1 protein using specific elisa's. the presence of salivary anxa1 protein was confirmed by western blotting. anxa1 protein is detectable in whole human saliva, as detected by western blot analysis and elisa. a diurnal rhythm was evident in both salivary cortisol (p<0.01) and anxa1 (p<0.01) and was defined as a significant difference  in time 0 (waking) samples compared to 'bed' (2300 h) samples. anxa1 protein did  not exhibit an awakening response (p>0.05), whereas salivary cortisol was significantly elevated between time 0 and 30 min post waking (p<0.001). anxa1 protein correlates positively with salivary cortisol, indicating that cortisol is most likely a regulator of anxa1 in human saliva.

TI  == a molecular survey of s. mutans and p. gingivalis oral microbial burden in human  saliva using relative endpoint polymerase chain reaction (re-pcr) within the population of a nevada dental school revealed disparities among minorities.
AB  == background: the university of nevada, las vegas school of dental medicine recently opened an orthodontic treatment clinic to address the needs of the racially and ethnically diverse population of southern nevada, primarily focusing on the treatment and care of low-income and minority patients. although orthodontic treatment and therapy has been shown to induce changes in the oral cavity, much of this evidence was collected from traditional white, teenage orthodontic clinic populations. the primary goal of this study was to describe the microbial burden of the cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis within the unlv-sdm patient population. methods: representative saliva samples were collected from healthy adult patients for dna isolation. relative endpoint polymerase chain reaction (re-pcr) was performed to ascertain the presence and relative microbial burden of these oral pathogens. results: nearly one quarter (13/56) or 23.3% of these patients had elevated levels of s. mutans, while (10/56) and 17.8% of these samples were found to have elevated levels of p. gingivalis, - with (90%) of p. gingivalis-positive  samples from minority patients (x2=17.921, d.f. = 1; p<0.0001). conclusions: these findings of elevated p. gingivalis levels, primarily among minority patients, may suggest underlying oral health practices contributing to adverse oral health conditions within this population. oral health knowledge and practices among minority patients may be strongly influenced by other factors, including education and socioeconomic status, suggesting additional research may  be needed to accurately determine the most appropriate standards for care and oral health education within this patient population.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of geranyloxy- and farnesyloxy-acetophenone  derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the compounds 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-geranyloxyacetophenone (1) and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-farnesyloxy-acetophenone (2) are oxyprenylated secondary metabolites extracted from plants belonging to the rutaceae family. in this study, 1 and 2 were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity toward major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by selective prenylation of 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone at the 4' position with geranyl and farnesyl bromide, respectively. compound 1 showed stronger antimicrobial activity than 2 against major oral pathogens, including gram positive bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus), gram negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis) and candida albicans. evidences were obtained that the mode of action of 1 and 2 may be related to their iron-chelating property. this study suggests that 1 and 2 may represent potential natural molecules for the prevention/treatment of common oral infections, including dental caries, periodontal disease, and candidiasis.

TI  == effect of s-prg eluate on biofilm formation and enzyme activity of oral bacteria.
AB  == recently, the antibacterial activity of a composite resin containing prereacted glass ionomer (s-prg) filler was revealed. we examined the effect of an s-prg eluate on various biologic activities of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. adherence ability of s. mutans was evaluated by microtiter plate assay; protease and gelatinase activities of p. gingivalis were examined by synthetic substrate hydrolysis and gelatin film spot assay, respectively. coaggregation of p. gingivalis with fusobacterium nucleatum was also examined. s-prg eluate was found to suppress streptococcal adherence. s-prg eluate inhibited the protease and gelatinase activities of p. gingivalis and the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results indicate that s-prg eluate suppresses streptococcal adherence and inhibits the protease and coaggregation activities of p. gingivalis. these findings may prompt research into novel strategies for preventing caries and periodontitis.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == antimicrobial peptide control of pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity: a  review of the literature.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides, molecules produced in many different organisms, have high biocidal activity against several microorganisms. however, several questions about these molecules remain unclear. therefore, this report details a systematic survey of the literature on the use of antimicrobial peptides against oral pathogens and indicates which peptides and microorganisms are most extensively studied. articles were located using the pubmed and science direct databases with the following inclusion criteria: publication date between 2002 and 2011; keywords "biofilm or biological film or biological layer or bacterial growth" and "peptide" and "oral cavity or mouth or buccal mucosa or oral mucosa or mouth mucosa"; and abstract in english. a total of 73 articles were selected after refinement of the data. an increase in publications focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides against oral microorganisms was observed. in addition, the peptides produced by cells of the oral mucosa (defensins, ll-37 and histatins) as well as streptococcus mutans (among cariogenic bacteria) and porphyromonas gingivalis (among periodontal bacteria) were the most studied subjects. it was concluded that the use of antimicrobial peptides as a tool for microbial control  is of increasing importance, likely due to its widespread use, mechanism of action, and low rates of bacterial resistance.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (emwi) on oral bacterial pathogens. methods and results: a gram-negative (porphyromonas gingivalis) or gram-positive (streptococcus mutans,  s. intermedius, enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by emw apparatus (500-1000 khz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). quantification of survival bacteria by cfu counting revealed that emwi exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 khz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. after emwi at 500 khz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of s. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (s.  mutans and p. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. emwi inhibited the inductive effect of s. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, emwi partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from p. gingivalis. conclusions: these findings demonstrated that emwi has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. significance and impact of the study: electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == inhibitory activity of aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. in the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. s. mutans was the species most sensitive to aloe vera gel with a mic of 12.5 microg/ml, while a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. fragilis were less sensitive, with a mic of 25-50 microg/ml (p < 0.01). based on our present findings it is concluded that aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial and osteogenic effect of ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface.
AB  == ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface was prepared by hydrothermal  treatment with h(2)o(2) followed by ag plasma immersion ion implantation. streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis and candida albicans were chosen for antimicrobial tests. genes related to microbial structure or adhesion, namely glucan-binding proteins b (gbpb), fimbria protein a (fima), and agglutinin-like sequence4 (als4), were examined. the osteoblast's attachment, viability, and quantitative analysis of osteogenic gene expression (alp, ocn, runx2) on titanium surfaces were evaluated. scanning electron microscopy (sem) revealed that ag nanoparticles of approximately 10 nm were incorporated on the nanostructured surface of titanium after ag plasma immersion ion implantation. trials showed that 93.99% of s. mutans, 93.57% of p. g, and 89.78% of c. albicans were killed on the ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface. gene expressions from the three microorganisms confirmed the antimicrobial activities of the ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface. furthermore, the adhesive images and viability assays indicated that the ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface did not impair osteoblasts. the expressions of osteoblast  phenotype genes in cells grown on the ag-implanted titanium surface were significantly increased. the results of this study suggest that the ag-implanted  titanium with a nanostructured surface displays good antimicrobial properties, reducing gene expressions of microorganisms, and excellent cell adhesion and osteogenic effects.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == in situ gastrointestinal protection against anthrax edema toxin by single-chain antibody fragment producing lactobacilli.
AB  == background: anthrax is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis and is regarded as one of the most prominent bioterrorism threats. anthrax toxicity is induced by the tripartite toxin complex, composed of the receptor-binding anthrax protective antigen and the two enzymatic subunits, lethal factor and edema factor. recombinant lactobacilli have previously been used to deliver antibody fragments  directed against surface epitopes of a variety of pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and rotavirus. here, we addressed whether or not anthrax toxins could be targeted and neutralised in the gastrointestinal tract by lactobacilli producing recombinant antibody fragments as a model system for toxin neutralisation in the gastrointestinal lumen. results: the neutralising anti-pa scfv, 1h, was expressed in l. paracasei as a secreted protein, a cell wall-anchored protein or both secreted and wall-anchored protein. cell wall display on lactobacilli and pa binding of the anchored constructs was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. binding of secreted or attached scfv produced by lactobacilli to pa were verified by elisa. both construct were able to protect macrophages in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. finally, lactobacilli producing the cell wall attached scfv were able to neutralise the activity of anthrax edema toxin in the gi tract of mice, in vivo.  conclusion: we have developed lactobacilli expressing a neutralising scfv fragment against the pa antigen of the anthrax toxin, which can provide protection against anthrax toxins both in vitro and in vivo. utilising engineered lactobacilli therapeutically for neutralising toxins in the gastrointestinal tract can potential be expanded to provide protection against a range of additional gastrointestinal pathogens. the ability of lactobacilli to colonise the gastrointestinal tract may allow the system to be used both prophylactically  and therapeutically.

AB  == objectives: modifications of titanium (ti) implant surfaces have a significant effect on early biofilm formation and the outcome of implant procedures. the aim  of this study was to examine the role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces in the adhesion mechanism of oral bacteria to modified ti surfaces. materials and methods: ti discs with three different types of surface modifications, machined,  acid-etched, and acid-etched and blasted, were examined for adhesion of oral bacteria: streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. following pretreatment of the ti with ion rich solutions or coating by human serum albumin or fibronectin, bacterial adhesion was examined by scanning electron microscopy and assessed quantitatively by dna analysis. ti coating by proteins as well as bacterial adhesion and their interrelationships were further  investigated through confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: acid-etched and blasted ti surfaces exhibited significantly higher amounts of bacteria adhesion than the other two surfaces. calcium was found to serve as a bridging agent in the adhesion process of s. mutans and f. nucleatum to ti surfaces. although albumin coating of the ti reduced the adhesion of s. mutans to all surfaces, it had no influence on the adhesion of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. coating the ti with fibronectin enhanced p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adhesion. conclusions: bacterial adhesion to ti surfaces is roughness-dependent, and the adhesion mechanism is influenced by ions and proteins of the initial coating derived from  the blood.

TI  == the short-term effects of various oral care methods in dependent elderly: comparison between toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine.
AB  == objectives: to explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. background: numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. however, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various  oral care methods for five consecutive days. materials and methods: the subjects  consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. after the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) tooth brushing 2) tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. results: consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an  improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and  oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). conclusions: it was suggested that the use of not  only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.

TI  == isoflavonoids and coumarins from glycyrrhiza uralensis: antibacterial activity against oral pathogens and conversion of isoflavans into isoflavan-quinones during purification.
AB  == phytochemical investigation of a supercritical fluid extract of glycyrrhiza uralensis has led to the isolation of 20 known isoflavonoids and coumarins, and glycycarpan (7), a new pterocarpan. the presence of two isoflavan-quinones, licoriquinone a (8) and licoriquinone b (9), in a fraction subjected to gel filtration on sephadex lh-20 is due to suspected metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of licoricidin (1) and licorisoflavan a (2). the major compounds in the extract, as well as 8, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of several major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 showed the most potent antibacterial activities, causing a marked growth inhibition of the cariogenic species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus at 10 mug/ml and the periodontopathogenic species porphyromonas gingivalis (at 5 mug/ml) and prevotella intermedia (at 5 mug/ml for 1 and 2.5 mug/ml for 2). only 1 moderately inhibited growth of fusobacterium nucleatum at the highest concentration tested (10 mug/ml).

TI  == oral biofilm analysis of palatal expanders by fluorescence in-situ hybridization  and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
AB  == confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) of natural heterogeneous biofilm is today facilitated by a comprehensive range of staining techniques, one of them being fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). we performed a pilot study in which oral biofilm samples collected from fixed orthodontic appliances (palatal expanders) were stained by fish, the objective being to assess the three-dimensional organization of natural biofilm and plaque accumulation. fish creates an opportunity to stain cells in their native biofilm environment by the  use of fluorescently labeled 16s rrna-targeting probes. compared to alternative techniques like immunofluorescent labeling, this is an inexpensive, precise and straightforward labeling technique to investigate different bacterial groups in mixed biofilm consortia. general probes were used that bind to eubacteria (eub338 + eub338ii + eub338iii; hereafter eubmix), firmicutes (lgc354 a-c; hereafter lgcmix), and bacteroidetes (bac303). in addition, specific probes binding to streptococcus mutans (mut590) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pogi) were used. the  extreme hardness of the surface materials involved (stainless steel and acrylic resin) compelled us to find new ways of preparing the biofilm. as these surface materials could not be readily cut with a cryotome, various sampling methods were explored to obtain intact oral biofilm. the most workable of these approaches is  presented in this communication. small flakes of the biofilm-carrying acrylic resin were scraped off with a sterile scalpel, taking care not to damage the biofilm structure. forceps were used to collect biofilm from the steel surfaces.  once collected, the samples were fixed and placed directly on polysine coated glass slides. fish was performed directly on these slides with the probes mentioned above. various fish protocols were combined and modified to create a new protocol that was easy to handle. subsequently the samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. well-known configurations could be visualized, including mushroom-style formations and clusters of coccoid bacteria  pervaded by channels. in addition, the bacterial composition of these typical biofilm structures were analyzed and 2d and 3d images created.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of o-cymen-5-ol and zinc, alone & in combination in simple  solutions and toothpaste formulations.
AB  == objectives: this study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o-cymen-5-ol/zinc system. methods: o-cymen-5-ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and candida albicans. synergy was investigated by checkerboard mic/mbc; inhibition of p. gingivalis protease activity and s. mutans glycolysis were investigated. slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against s. mutans and e.  coli. results: o-cymen-5-ol mic was between 1.7 mm to 3.4 mm; mbc was 3.4 mm to 6.7 mm. zinc gluconate mic was 2.8 mm to 11 mm; mbc was between 11 mm and >44 mm. the two agents in solution showed synergy (fici</=0.50) against p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, with mic of 0.42 mm/0.69 mm for o-cymen-5-ol/zinc gluconate, respectively. zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o-cymen-5-ol; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive. o-cymen-5-ol/zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo (120s log10 kill=7.35+/-0.40 and 4.02+/-0.40, respectively). conclusions: the zinc/o-cymen-5-ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease-related processes. synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes. a system combining o-cymen-5-ol and zinc shows properties desirable for incorporation in toothpastes.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == chlorhexidine varnishes effectively inhibit porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans - an in vivo study.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine varnish (cervitec- ivoclar vivadent- liechtenstein) is  a sustained-release delivery system that can provide protection against white spots and gingivitis, which are common iatrogenic side effects of orthodontic treatment. chlorhexidine in varnish form does not depend on patient compliance, does not stain teeth or alter taste sensation like the mouth rinse. materials and methods: a split-mouth technique was followed in the treatment of 30 patients selected by stringent selection criteria, evaluating a single application of the  test varnish on two randomly allotted quadrants along with a placebo on the other two quadrants. streptococcus mutans counts responsible for white spots and p. gingivalis count [using pcr test] responsible for gingivitis were done at the start of the study, and then 1 and 3 months later. results: the chlorhexidine varnish reduced the streptococci mutans count at the end of 1 month, and this reduction was statistically significant. at the end of 3 months, there was no difference in the s. mutans counts between the two groups. there was a statistically significant reduction in the p. gingivalis count at the end of both 1 and 3 months in comparison to the placebo group. conclusion: chlorhexidine varnishes are capable of reducing s. mutans and p. gingivalis and gingivitis, thus improving the overall oral health of the patient. the side effects of chlorhexidine mouth rinses are not seen with this varnish. an application schedule of at least once a month is recommended as the effectiveness is reduced  comparatively at the end of 3 months.

AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial communities in endotracheal tube biofilms.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most prevalent acquired infection of patients on intensive care units and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. evidence suggests that an improved understanding of the  composition of the biofilm communities that form on endotracheal tubes may result in the development of improved preventative strategies for ventilator-associated  pneumonia. methodology/principal findings: the aim of this study was to characterise microbial biofilms on the inner luminal surface of extubated endotracheal tubes from icu patients using pcr and molecular profiling. twenty-four endotracheal tubes were obtained from twenty mechanically ventilated  patients. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiling of 16s rrna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population, together with species specific pcr of key marker oral microorganisms and a quantitative assessment of culturable aerobic bacteria. analysis of culturable aerobic bacteria revealed a range of colonisation from no growth to 2.1x10(8) colony forming units (cfu)/cm(2) of endotracheal tube (mean 1.4x10(7) cfu/cm(2)). pcr targeting of specific bacterial species detected the oral bacteria streptococcus mutans (n = 5) and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 5). dgge profiling of the endotracheal biofilms revealed complex banding patterns containing between 3 and 22 (mean 6) bands per tube, thus demonstrating the marked complexity of the constituent biofilms. significant inter-patient diversity was evident. the number of dgge bands detected was not related to total viable microbial counts or the duration of intubation. conclusions/significance: molecular profiling using dgge  demonstrated considerable biofilm compositional complexity and inter-patient diversity and provides a rapid method for the further study of biofilm composition in longitudinal and interventional studies. the presence of oral microorganisms in endotracheal tube biofilms suggests that these may be important in biofilm development and may provide a therapeutic target for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == periodontal pathogens interfere with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence properties in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background and objective: the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens dominate at disease sites is not yet understood. one possibility is that these late colonizers antagonize the quorum-sensing systems of early colonizers and render those early colonizers less resistant to environmental factors. in this study, we utilized streptococcus mutans, a well-documented oral streptococcus with many quorum-sensing-dependent properties, as an example of an earlier colonizer antagonized by periodontal pathogens. material and methods: in this study, s. mutans ng8 and s. mutans lt11 were used in experiments assessing transformation,  and s. mutans bm71 was used in experiments investigating bacteriocin production.  the effects of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on these competence-stimulating peptide-dependent properties were evaluated in mixed-broth assays. results: both p. gingivalis (either live bacteria or membrane vesicles) and t. denticola antagonized transformation in s.  mutans ng8 and lt11. the production of bacteriocin by s. mutans bm71 was also inhibited by p. gingivalis and t. denticola. boiling of these late colonizers before addition to the broth cultures abolished their ability to inhibit s. mutans transformation and bacteriocin production. p. gingivalis and t. denticola  inactivated s. mutans exogenous competence-stimulating peptide, whereas the boiled bacteria did not. conclusions: this study demonstrated that periodontal pathogens antagonize s. mutans quorum-sensing properties. this may render s. mutans less virulent and less resistant to environmental antibacterial factors.

AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide ksl on the growth of oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such  as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. as one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (amps), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of ksl (kkvvfkvkfk-nh(2)), a novel amp, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as candida albicans in vitro. streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of s. mutans to ksl. the effect of ksl on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. for biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. the results showed that ksl had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to ksl peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.0625 mg/ml] compared with other species tested (mics of 0.125-1mg/ml). ksl also inhibited s.  mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/ml, and reduced 1-day-old developed s. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. clsm images showed that ksl significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. this study suggests that ksl may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == mechanistic studies of agmatine deiminase from multiple bacterial species.
AB  == one subfamily of guanidino group-modifying enzymes (gmes) consists of the agmatine deiminases (agds). these enzymes catalyze the conversion of agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) to n-carbamoyl putrescine and ammonia. in plants, viruses, and bacteria, these enzymes are thought to be involved in energy production, biosynthesis of polyamines, and biofilm formation. in particular, we  are interested in the role that this enzyme plays in pathogenic bacteria. previously, we reported the initial kinetic characterization of the agmatine deiminase from helicobacter pylori and described the synthesis and characterization the two most potent agd inactivators. herein, we have expanded our initial efforts to characterize the catalytic mechanisms of agd from h. pylori as well as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. through the  use of ph rate profiles, pk(a) measurements of the active site cysteine, solvent  isotope effects, and solvent viscosity effects, we have determined that the agds, like pads 1 and 4, utilize a reverse protonation mechanism.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

AB  == objective: this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of omega-6, -7, -9  (n-6, n-7, n-9) fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids, such as gamma-linoleic acid (gla), linoleic acid (la), arachidonic acid (ara), palmitoleic acid (pa), and oleic acid (oa), their fatty acid ethyl esters, gla-ee, la-ee, ara-ee, pa-ee, oa-ee, and their fatty acid methyl esters, gla-me, la-me, ara-me, pa-me, oa-me, were investigated for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. various concentrations of the fatty acids, their methyl and ethyl esters were tested against various oral pathogens in 96-well plates and blood-agar plate. the plates were incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 degrees c for 48h, and the colony forming units (cfu) were determined. results: the data demonstrated that select n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and their esters exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against these oral microorganisms, demonstrating some specificity for individual microbial species. conclusion: the  potential use or the combinations of the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and/or their esters, provided in a local delivery vehicle to infected sites in the oral cavity, could be considered as an additional therapeutic approach to improving oral health.

TI  == effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == we report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (h(2)s >1.5 or ch(3)sh >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice  at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. mouth air was monitored for vsc levels  at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. at 10 min,  the level of ch(3)sh was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; p = 0.011). the median concentration of ch(3)sh in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2  h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. no difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative pcr, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number  at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; p = 0.033). these results indicate a suppressive effect of the  test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

TI  == roles of oral bacteria in cardiovascular diseases--from molecular mechanisms to clinical cases: porphyromonas gingivalis is the important role of intimal hyperplasia in the aorta.
AB  == it has been reported that dna of oral bacterial species, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans, was detected frequently in specimens of arteriosclerotic vessels. however, the source of dna, whether from live intact bacteria or a part of the bacteria, has not been identified yet. moreover, there  was no precise evidence concerning involvement of oral bacteria in the progression of arteriosclerosis. we tried to clarify the involvement of p. gingivalis on the mechanisms of development of aortic intimal hyperplasia. intravenous administration of p. gingivalis dramatically induced intimal hyperplasia in the mouse model with photochemical impairment of the femoral artery. however there were no changes identified in the mice without aortic impairment, even with the p. gingivalis infection. concomitantly, s100 calcium-binding protein a9 (s100a9) and the embryonic isoform of myosin heavy chain (smemb), a proliferative phenotypic marker of smooth muscle cells, were significantly overexpressed on the surfaces of smooth muscle cells present in the injured blood vessels. similarly, increased expressions of s100a9 and smemb proteins were observed in aneurismal specimens obtained from p. gingivalis-infected patients. we found that bacteremia induced by p. gingivalis leads to intimal hyperplasia associated with overexpressions of s100a9 and smemb. our results strongly suggest that oral-hematogenous spreading of p. gingivalis is a causative event in the development of aortic hyperplasia in periodontitis patients.

TI  == identification of immunological parameters associated with the alveolar bone level in periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the present study was performed to clarify the relationship between periodontal disease severity and selected immunological parameters consisting of  serum igg titer against periodontopathogenic bacteria, the expression of the helper t-cell cytokine by gingival mononuclear cells, and patients' immunoreactivity to cross-reactive heat shock protein (hsp) epitope peptide from  p. gingivalis hsp60. methods: twenty-five patients with moderate periodontitis had their gingival connective tissue harvested of gingival mononuclear cells during an open flap debridement procedure and peripheral blood was drawn by venipuncture to collect serum. the mean level of interproximal alveolar bone was  calculated to be used as an index for periodontal disease severity for a given patient. each of selected immunologic parameters was subject to statistical management to seek their correlations with the severity of periodontal disease. results: a significant correlation could not be identified between serum igg titers against specific bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus mutans) and the severity of periodontal disease. expression of interleukin (il)-10 by gingival mononuclear cells was statistically significant in the group of patients who had higher levels of alveolar bone height. however,  a similar correlation could not be demonstrated in cases for il-4 or interferon-gamma. patients' serum reactivity to cross-reactive epitope peptide showed a significant correlation with the amount of alveolar bone. conclusions: it was concluded that expression of il-10 by gingival mononuclear cells and patients' sero-reactivity to the cross-reactive hsp peptide of p. gingivalis hsp60 were significantly correlated with alveolar bone height.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == periodontitis, periodontopathic bacteria and lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is a component of saliva and is suspected to be a defense factor against oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. periodontitis is a very common oral disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria.  antimicrobial activities and other biological effects of lf against representative periodontopathic bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, have been widely studied. association of polymorphisms in lf with incidence of aggressive periodontitis and the role of lf in the gingival crevicular fluid as a marker of periodontitis severity have also been reported. periodontopathic bacteria reside as a biofilm in supragingival and subgingival plaque. our recent study indicated that lf exhibits antibacterial activity against planktonic forms of p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia at higher concentrations, and furthermore, lf effectively inhibits biofilm formation and reduces the established biofilm of these bacteria at physiological concentrations. a small-scale clinical study indicated that oral administration of bovine lf reduces p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients. lf seems to be a biofilm inhibitor of periodontopathic bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == oral bacterial extracts facilitate early osteogenic/dentinogenic differentiation  in human dental pulp-derived cells.
AB  == objectives: bacterial metabolites demineralize dental hard tissues, and soluble factors lead to tertiary dentinogenesis in the area of the dentin-pulp complex. however, it is unclear whether the oral bacteria are directly involved in the differentiation of dental pulp cells. in this study, we evaluated the effect of oral bacterial extracts on cellular differentiation in human dental pulp-derived  cells (hdpc). study design: the hdpc were obtained from third molar teeth, and the cells were subcultured. the sonicated extracts were obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis (gram-negative) and streptococcus mutans (gram-positive). the effect of bacterial extracts on cellular growth and differentiation in hdpc were tested. results: alkaline phosphatase activity and bone sialoprotein (bsp) gene expression were increased in hdpc exposed to low concentrations of both sonicated extracts, whereas the activity was decreased upon exposure to high concentrations of sonicated extracts from p. gingivalis. conclusion: this is the first evidence that oral bacteria have a positive effect  on cellular differentiation in hpdc.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == polymorphism of salivary histatin gene and periodontal disease in the japanese population.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a widespread and major dental disease. recent studies have analyzed a possible relationship between polymorphism of several genes and periodontitis. histatins are salivary polypeptides with fungicidal activities against candida albicans and yeast and bactericidal activities against porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. histatins are part of the innate defense of the oral cavity. we examined the frequency of the polymorphism  codon 23 of the histatin 3 gene (his2 allele) in relation to periodontitis in the japanese population. the subjects were 143 japanese individuals, of which 63 were healthy control subjects and 80 were periodontal patients. we isolated genomic dna from lingual mucosal cells and tested them for single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp). the incidence of polymorphism was analyzed statistically by fisher's  exact test. the results indicated that the gene polymorphism at codon 23 of the histatin 3 gene was not associated with periodontitis in the japanese population  (p = 0.166). rather, if at all, it appeared to be associated with resistance to periodontitis.

AB  == introduction: lactoferrin (lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. we hypothesized that lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. the objective was to investigate the effect of lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. methods: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3 ml/min) with and without lf (100 microg/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3 h, 37 degrees c). attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) with lf-coated (20-100 microg/ml) and uncoated glass slides. the effects of beta-lactoglobulin, 2,2'-dipyridyl (25-100 microg/ml), an  iron chelator, and fecl3 on attachment were also examined. results: lf inhibited  the initial attachment of s. gordonii (50.3%, p < 0.05) but not that of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. however, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing s. gordonii (i.e. s. gordonii/f. nucleatum or s. gordonii/p. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, p < 0.05) in the presence of lf. beta-lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of s. gordonii. in the presence of 100 microm 2,2'-dipyridyl, attachment of s. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. no reduction in attachment was noted in s. gordonii pretreated with lf (100 microg/ml) and fecl3 (20-200 microm). conclusion: lf suppresses initial attachment of s. gordonii and s. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. this may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == new methods for selective isolation of bacterial dna from human clinical specimens.
AB  == separation of bacterial dna from human dna in clinical samples may have an important impact on downstream applications, involving microbial diagnostic systems. we evaluated two commercially available reagents (molysis), molzym gmbh  & co. kg, bremen and pureprove, sirs-lab gmbh, jena, both germany) for their potential to isolate and purify bacterial dna from human dna. we chose oral samples, which usually contain very high amounts of both human and bacterial cells. three different dna preparations each were made from eight caries and eight periodontal specimens using the two reagents above and a conventional dna extraction strategy as reference. based on target-specific real-time-quantitative pcr assays we compared the reduction of human dna versus loss of bacterial dna. human dna was monitored by targeting the beta-2-microglobulin gene, while bacteria were monitored by targeting 16s rdna (total bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis) or the glycosyltransferase gene (streptococcus mutans). we found that in most cases at least 90% of human dna could successfully be removed, with complete removal in eight of 16 cases using molysis, and two (of 16) cases using  pureprove. conversely, detection of bacterial dna was possible in all cases with  a recovery rate generally ranging from 35% to 50%. in conclusion, both strategies have the potential to reduce background interference from the host dna which may  be of remarkable value for nucleic-acid based microbial diagnostic systems.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == ceragenin csa-13 exhibits antimicrobial activity against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: ceragenin csa-13 is a bile-acid-based mimic of endogenous antimicrobial peptides and shares a mechanism of action with many of these antimicrobial agents. because csa-13 is not peptide based, it is not a substrate  for the proteases that are found in the oral cavity, which are capable of degrading antimicrobial peptides. furthermore, the simplicity of the ceragenins makes them easier to prepare and purify than antimicrobial peptides. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial activities of csa-13 against oral pathogens  and found that this compound was bactericidal against all of the strains tested.  methods: the strains used were isolates of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using agar dilution methods. in susceptibility testing, viable counts were determined after  incubation with csa-13. results: csa-13 was potent against all 23 strains tested  with mics of 1-8 microg/ml for s. mutans and 1-16 microg/ml for 24 strains of the genus porphyromonas. the mic(50) was 2 and the mic(90) was 8 mug/ml for s. mutans. mic ranges for protease-positive p. gingivalis and p. cangingivalis were  2-16 microg/ml, and 1-2 microg/ml for protease-negative p. circumdentaria. csa-13 interacted with lipopolysaccharide-sensitized erythrocytes at a concentration of  5.0-20.0 microg/ml. conclusion: csa-13 displays broad-spectrum activity against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria. csa-13 was effective against protease-positive porphyromonas. it was shown to bind to erythrocytes coated with lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid from diverse bacterial strains. these results suggest that csa-13 may be useful for the prevention and treatment of oral microbial diseases.

TI  == bacterial profiles of oral streptococcal and periodontal bacterial species in saliva specimens from japanese subjects.
AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, gamma interferon, and a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix form a synergistic trio that induces c-jun n-terminal kinase 1-mediated nitric oxide generation and cell death.
AB  == during infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. fibronectin fragments  are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. the mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. one likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. the aim of  this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (afn) exerts  its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. our data demonstrate that afn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (pdl) cells. these effects and  apoptosis were inhibited by inos suppression and enhanced by inos overexpression. nitric oxide and inos induction were paralleled by increased c-jun n-terminal kinase 1 (jnk-1) phosphorylation. jnk-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and inos, whereas inhibiting jnk-1 by small interfering rna or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. priming pdl cells with porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (lps), or gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. escherichia coli and streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to  a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via jnk-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. lps and ifn-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect  on host cells.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.

TI  == novel anti-microbial therapies for dental plaque-related diseases.
AB  == control of dental plaque-related diseases has traditionally relied on non-specific removal of plaque by mechanical means. as our knowledge of oral disease mechanisms increases, future treatment is likely to be more targeted, for example at small groups of organisms, single species or at key virulence factors  they produce. the aim of this review is to consider the current status as regards novel treatment approaches. maintenance of oral hygiene often includes use of chemical agents; however, increasing problems of resistance to synthetic antimicrobials have encouraged the search for alternative natural products. plants are the source of more than 25% of prescription and over-the-counter preparations, and the potential of natural agents for oral prophylaxis will therefore be considered. targeted approaches may be directed at the black-pigmented anaerobes associated with periodontitis. such pigments provide an opportunity for targeted phototherapy with high-intensity monochromatic light. studies to date have demonstrated selective killing of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in biofilms. functional inhibition approaches, including the use of protease inhibitors, are also being explored to control periodontitis. replacement therapy by which a resident pathogen is replaced with  a non-pathogenic bacteriocin-producing variant is currently under development with respect to streptococcus mutans and dental caries.

AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == potential oral health benefits of cranberry.
AB  == in the past decade, cranberry extracts have been attracting ever-growing attention by dental researchers. the potential benefits of cranberry components in reducing oral diseases, including dental caries and periodontitis, are discussed in this review. a non-dialysable cranberry fraction enriched in high molecular weight polyphenols has very promising properties with respect to cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria, as well as to the host inflammatory response and enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. cranberry components  are potential anti-caries agents since they inhibit acid production, attachment,  and biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans. glucan-binding proteins, extracellular enzymes, carbohydrate production, and bacterial hydrophobicity, are all affected by cranberry components. regarding periodontal diseases, the same cranberry fraction inhibits host inflammatory responses, production, and activity of enzymes that cause the destruction of the extracellular matrix, biofilm formation, and adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis, and proteolytic activities  and coaggregation of periodontopathogens. the above-listed effects suggest that cranberry components, especially those with high molecular weight, could serve as bioactive molecules for the prevention and/or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == oral malodor reduction by a palatal mucoadhesive tablet containing herbal formulation.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to test the effect of a palatal mucoadhesive tablet containing an herbal formulation on oral malodor production and volatile sulfide compound (vsc) levels, and to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. methods: a total of 56 healthy young volunteers participated in experiments 1 and 2. the palatal adhesive tablets were prepared with different active ingredients (herbal formulation, zinc and chlorhexidine), or without an active ingredient as control (placebo). measurement included odor judge scores (two judges) and vsc readings by a sulfide monitor (halimeter). in experiment 3,  the antimicrobial activity of the herbal formulation ingredients (i.e. sage, echinacea, lavender and mastic gum) were tested against three oral pathogens (streptoccocus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis and candida albicans) by the agar diffusion test. results: application of the palatal adhesive tablets containing herbal formulation resulted in a significant reduction in both oral malodor scores (p<0.001) and vsc levels (p=0.013). herbal formulation showed higher significance in vsc reduction (p=0.001), as compared to zinc and chlorhexidine (p=0.024 and 0.032, respectively). sage, lavender and mastic gum showed antimicrobial activity against all three oral pathogens. conclusions: results of  the present study suggest that the palatal adhesive tablets containing herbal formulation may serve as an effective means of treatment for patients complaining of oral malodor.

TI  == analysis of the activity to induce toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-mediated stimulation of supragingival plaque.
AB  == background: the deleterious effects of the accumulation of supragingival plaque are well known, but the role of the proinflammatory property of supragingival plaque in periodontal diseases has not been completely elucidated. the aim of this study was to determine the relevance of toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque to periodontal parameters. methods: we isolated 144 supragingival plaque samples and analyzed tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity using genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary reporter cells that express a reporter molecule upon activation of nuclear factor-kappa b through tlr2 or tlr4. the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans cells in each plaque sample were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation, but not tlr2-mediated stimulation, was positively associated with the plaque score and bleeding on probing score of the  teeth from which the plaque samples were taken. the activity to induce tlr2-mediated stimulation, but not tlr4-mediated stimulation, was negatively associated with probing depth and clinical attachment level. the ratio of tlr4-/tlr2-mediated stimulation was positively associated with all of those parameters. the number of p. gingivalis cells in each plaque sample was associated with the plaque score and clinical attachment level, but no strong association was observed between the ratio of examined bacteria in each plaque sample and the activity to induce tlr2- or tlr4-mediated stimulation, except for  a weak correlation between the ratio of a. actinomycetemcomitans cells and the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation. conclusion: the tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque is associated with clinical parameters for gingivitis and periodontitis.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == in vitro antioxidant potential of medicinal plant extracts and their activities against oral bacteria based on brazilian folk medicine.
AB  == background and objectives: this study aims to determine antibacterial activities  of cocos nucifera (husk fiber), ziziphus joazeiro (inner bark), caesalpinia pyramidalis (leaves), aqueous extracts and aristolochia cymbifera (rhizomes) alcoholic extract against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei. the antioxidant activity and acute toxicity of these extracts were also evaluated. material and methods: the plant extracts antibacterial activity was evaluated in  vitro and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth  micro-dilution assay. the bacterial killing kinetic was also evaluated for all extracts. in addition, the antibacterial effect of the extracts was tested in vitro on artificial oral biofilms. the acute toxicity of each extract was determined in according to lorke [lorke d. a new approach to practical acute toxicity testing. arch toxicol 1983;54:275-87] and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by dpph photometric assay [mensor ll, menezes fs, leitao gg, reis as, santos tc, coube cs, et al. screening of brazilian plants extract for antioxidant activity by the use of dpph free radical method. phytother res 2001;15:127-30]. results: mic and the bactericidal concentrations were identical, for each evaluated extract. however, microbes of artificial biofilms were less sensitive to the extracts than the planktonic strains. a. cymbifera extract induced the highest bactericidal effect against all tested bacteria, followed by c. nucifera, z. joazeiro and c. pyramidalis extracts, respectively. all extracts showed good antioxidant potential, being c. nucifera and c. pyramidalis aqueous extracts the  most active ones. conclusion: in conclusion, all oral bacteria tested (planktonic or in artificial biofilms) were more susceptible to, and rapidly killed in presence of a. cymbifera, c. pyramidalis and c. nucifera than z. joazeiro extracts, respectively. thus, these extracts may be of great interest for future  studies about treatment of oral diseases, considering their potent antioxidant activity and low toxicity.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == effects of 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid and its ester derivatives on biofilm formation by two oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid, active principle isolated from acronychia baueri schott, and its ester derivatives on biofilm formation by two important oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. the parent acid and conjugates with vanillic acid, 2-hydroxynaphthoquinone and guaiacol caused a significant and reproducible inhibition of p. gingivalis biofilm formation. this effect could be related to the ability of the compounds to inhibit bacterial growth. these compounds also efficiently caused a reduction of biofilm formation by s. mutans, a phenomenon not related to growth inhibition. these data suggest that 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid and some of its ester derivatives may have a therapeutic/preventive potential for oral infections.

TI  == effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  == this in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and  mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than e. faecalis. the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. it was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the findings from  this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == compressed mints and chewing gum containing magnolia bark extract are effective against bacteria responsible for oral malodor.
AB  == flavors and natural botanic extracts are often used in chewing gum and compressed mints for breath freshening and relief of oral malodor. the oral malodor is a result of bacterial putrification of proteinaceous materials from food or saliva. in this study, magnolia bark extract (mbe) and its two main components, magnolol  and honokiol, were evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) test.  the inhibitory effect of mbe mint was further evaluated by a kill-time assay study. in addition, an in vivo study was performed on nine healthy volunteers postlunch. saliva samples were taken before and after subjects consumed mints and gum, with and without mbe. listerine mouthwash was included as a positive control. the testing results indicated that mbe and its two main constituents demonstrated a strong germ-kill effect against bacteria responsible for halitosis and also streptococcus mutans, bacteria involved in dental caries formation. the  mic of magnolol, honokiol, and mbe on porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and s. mutans ranged from 8 to 31 microg/ml. kill-time assay results indicated that mints containing 0.2% mbe reduced more than 99.9% of three oral bacteria within 5 min of treatment. the in vivo study demonstrated that mbe containing mints reduced total salivary bacteria by 61.6% at 30 min and 33.8% at  60 min postconsumption. in comparison, the flavorless mint reduced total salivary bacteria by 3.6% at 30 min and increased total bacteria by 47.9% at 60 min. the mbe containing chewing gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 43.0% at 40 min, while placebo gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 18.0%. in conclusion, mbe demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against organisms responsible for oral malodor and can be incorporated in compressed mints and chewing gum for  improved breath-freshening benefits.

AB  == objective: down's syndrome (ds) individuals suffer from an increased susceptibility to infections. here, we assessed age-related changes in the salivary-specific humoral immunity of ds subjects. design: parotid and whole saliva were collected from a young group of ds (yds, n=30, 23.3+/-4 years), an older group of ds individuals (ods, n=10, 51.9+/-8 years) and compared to two age-matched groups of healthy volunteers--a young group (yc, n=29, 22.8+/-5 years) and an older group (oc, n=10, 48.4+/-9 years). the levels of total iga, and specific antibodies to three common oral pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans)  were analysed. results: the limited increases in iga concentrations could not compensate the dramatic reduction in the salivary flow rate observed in ds individuals. therefore, the median secretion rates of the specific antibodies in  whole and parotid saliva were 70-77% and 34-60% (respectively) lower in yds individuals as compared to yc and farther 77-100% and 75-88% (respectively) lower in ods compared to yds. in contrast, the antibody secretion rates were similar for parotid saliva, or even increased for whole saliva of oc, compared with yc. consequently, a dramatic cumulative extreme reduction (>92%) in the bacterial specific salivary antibodies differentiated the adult ds individuals from to their age-matched controls. conclusions: our results indicate a severe immunodeficiency in the secretion rate of the specific salivary iga response of in ds individuals which intensifies with age.

TI  == targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species  in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in  saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

AB  == objective: to test the antiadherent and antibacterial properties of surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic titanium oxide (tio(2)). materials and methods: tio(2) was coated on the surface of the orthodontic wires  by a sol-gel thin film dip-coating method. bacterial adhesion to the wires was evaluated by the weight change of the wires. the antibacterial activity of the surface-modified orthodontic wires was demonstrated by the dilution agar plate method for streptococcus mutans and spectrophotometry for porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the orthodontic wires coated with the photocatalytic tio(2)  showed an antiadherent effect against s. mutans compared with the uncoated wires. the bacterial mass that bound to the tio(2)-coated orthodontic wires remained unchanged, whereas that of the uncoated wires increased by 4.97%. furthermore, the tio(2)-coated orthodontic wires had a bactericidal effect on s. mutans and p. gingivalis, which cause dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. the antiadherent and antibacterial mechanisms of tio(2) to break down the cell wall of those bacteria were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. conclusion: the  surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic tio(2) can be used  to prevent the development of dental plaque during orthodontic treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in community development with streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the causative agents of adult periodontitis, develops biofilm microcolonies on substrata of streptococcus gordonii but not on  streptococcus mutans. p. gingivalis genome microarrays were used to identify genes differentially regulated during accretion of p. gingivalis in heterotypic biofilms with s. gordonii. thirty-three genes showed up- or downregulation by array analysis, and differential expression was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr. the functions of the regulated genes were predominantly related to metabolism and energy production. in addition, many of the genes have  no current known function. the roles of two upregulated genes, ftsh (pg0047) encoding an atp-dependent zinc metallopeptidase and ptpa (pg1641) encoding a putative tyrosine phosphatase, were investigated further by mutational analysis.  strains with mutations in these genes developed more abundant biofilms with s. gordonii than the parental strain developed. ftsh and ptpa may thus participate in a regulatory network that constrains p. gingivalis accumulation in heterotypic biofilms. this study provided a global analysis of p. gingivalis transcriptional  responses in an oral microbial community and also provided insight into the regulation of heterotypic biofilm development.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == in vitro assessment of antimicrobial peptides as potential agents against several oral bacteria.
AB  == background: antimicrobial peptides are components of the innate immunity that play an important role in systemic and oral health. objectives: the antibacterial activity of the amphibian-derived k4 -s4(1-15)a antimicrobial peptide was tested  against oral pathogens associated with caries and periodontitis and compared with the activities of the human-derived antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and dhvar4a. methods: growth inhibition of planktonic bacteria was tested using standard microdilution assays. live/dead staining followed by confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to determine the bactericidal effect of k4 -s4(1-15)a  on streptococcus mutans attached to a glass surface or grown as biofilm. results: the cariogenic species s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus paracasei and actinomyces viscosus were resistant to ll-37 found in the oral cavity. porphyromonas gingivalis was the species most resistant to the three tested peptides. k4 -s4(1-15)a demonstrated the highest activity against the tested planktonic bacteria. in addition, k4 -s4(1-15)a was bactericidal to surface-attached s. mutans as well as to s. mutans biofilms grown in vitro. however, surface attachment increased s. mutans resistance to the antimicrobial peptide. conclusions: our results support growing evidence suggesting the use of  antimicrobial peptides for prevention and treatment of oral disease.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of  teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of  85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue  care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == interactions of oral pathogens with toll-like receptors: possible role in atherosclerosis.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlr) function as important signal transducers that mediate innate immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens through pattern recognition of virulence molecules. although tlrs mediate protection against infection, it is also likely that they may have a pathophysiologic role in certain inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. in atherosclerotic lesions, endothelial cells  and macrophages have been shown to upregulate tlr expression and may respond to tlr agonists of microbial origin, resulting in detrimental inflammatory reactions. some of these potential tlr-activating virulence factors may be of oral origin. the detection in atherosclerotic plaques of dna specific for porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens suggests that these pathogens disseminate into the systemic circulation and localize in atheromas. the potential of periodontal and some other oral pathogens to activate tlrs in vivo is suggested by findings from cell culture experiments on interactions of selected virulence protein adhesins with tlrs and their coreceptors. specifically, we have shown that proinflammatory cytokine induction by p. gingivalis fimbriae was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to tlr2, tlr4, cd14, and beta2 integrins, but not by immunoglobulin isotype controls. cytokine induction by bacteroides forsythus protein a depended heavily on cd14 and tlr2. we also found that the ability of streptococcus mutans protein agi/ii to stimulate cytokine release was partially dependent on cd14 and tlr4. moreover, p. gingivalis fimbriae induced tlr-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappab and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in monocytic cells. these proinflammatory activities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and similar inflammatory mechanisms could potentially operate in atherosclerosis. studies by  other groups have shown that p. gingivalis is capable of stimulating low-density  lipoprotein oxidation, foam cell formation, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque through induction of matrix metalloproteinases. interestingly, at least some of these activities can be induced by tlr agonists (lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock protein-60) from chlamydia pneumoniae, a major risk factor in atherosclerosis. future research in animal models and in vitro cellular systems with defined mutations in tlrs may implicate tlr participation in oral pathogen-mediated atherosclerotic processes, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the epidemiological findings linking oral pathogens to atherosclerotic  disease.

TI  == inhibitory effect of garlic extract on oral bacteria.
AB  == garlic (allium sativum) has long been known to have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties but there are few data on its effects against oral bacterial species particularly putative periodontal pathogens or their enzymes. filter sterilised, aqueous extract of garlic was tested for ability to inhibit the growth of a range of oral species and to inhibit the trypsin-like and total protease activity porphyromonas gingivalis. the garlic extract (57.1% (w/v), containing 220 microg/ml allicin) inhibited the growth and killed most of the organisms tested. in general, the minimal inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the gram-negative strains (garlic mic range 35.7-1.1 mg/ml; allicin mean mic 4.1 microg/ml; mean mbc 7.9 microg/ml) were lower than those for the gram-positive strains tested (garlic mic range 142.7-35.7 mg/ml; allicin mean mic 27.5 microg/ml; mean mbc 91.9 microg/ml). also, of the organisms tested, the  putative periodontal pathogens had among the lowest mics (17.8-1.1 mg/ml garlic)  and mbcs (35.7-1.1 mg/ml garlic). time-kill curves for streptococcus mutans and p. ginigvalis, showed that killing of the latter started almost immediately, whereas there was a delay before s. mutans was killed. the garlic extract also inhibited the trypsin-like and total protease activity of p. gingivalis by 92.7%  and 94.88%, respectively. these data indicate that garlic extract inhibits the growth of oral pathogens and certain proteases and so may have therapeutic value, particularly for periodontitis.

AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == phototoxic effect of visible light on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum: an in vitro study.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of visible light irradiation combined with photosensitizers has been reported. the objective of this was to test the effect  of visible light irradiation without photosensitizers on the viability of oral microorganisms. strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus faecalis in suspension or grown on agar were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400-500 nm. these wavelengths are used to photopolymerize composite resins widely used for dental restoration. three photocuring light sources, quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp, light-emitting diode and plasma-arc, at power densities between 260 and 1300 mw/cm2 were used for up to 3 min. bacterial samples were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. the results show that blue light sources exert a phototoxic effect on p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the minimal inhibitory dose for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was 16-62 j/cm2, a value significantly lower than that for s. mutans and s. faecalis (159-212 j/cm2). near-infrared diode laser irradiation did not affect any of the bacteria tested. our results suggest that visible light sources without exogenous photosensitizers have a phototoxic effect mainly on gram-negative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == increase in cariogenic bacteria after initial periodontal therapy.
AB  == this study examined the hypothesis of an intra-oral shift, during initial periodontal therapy, from a periopathogenic to a cariogenic flora. seventy-one patients with periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment strategies: (1) scaling and root planing, quadrant by quadrant, at two-week intervals (nc); (2) full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hrs (frp); or (3) full-mouth disinfection within 24 hrs, including antiseptics [chlorhexidine (chx) or amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (f) for 2 mos, or chx for 2 mos followed by f for 6 mos (chx+f)]. at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 mos, bacterial samples were taken from supra- and subgingival plaque, saliva, and tongue. the detection frequencies and relative proportions of streptococcus mutans increased in the nc and frp groups, but decreased in the f group. in the chx group, these species disappeared temporarily, but they disappeared for the entire 8 mos in the chx+f group. these observations were similar for all sample locations. the periopathogens decreased in all groups. this finding confirms the  abovementioned hypothesis and indicates a need for caries prophylactic regimens.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of endodontic files after cleaning and steam sterilization procedures.
AB  == background: infection control procedures are essential for modern dental practice and they are continually evolving to meet the dental profession's high standards. the present study evaluated the efficacy of two cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers on endodontic files, and evaluated the effect of biological debris on the subsequent sterilization of files. methods: stainless steel and nickel-titanium (niti) files were examined upon removal from the manufacturer's packaging, after instrumentation in root canals of human teeth inoculated with a  broth containing two anaerobic species and one facultative anaerobic species of bacteria, and after instrumentation and cleaning with either an ultrasonic bath or a thermal disinfector. for each file, the bacterial numbers were quantified using routine microbiological techniques in an anaerobic chamber. results: no bacteria were detected from files direct from their packets. the size, taper and  type of file did not affect the ability of either of the cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers. however, an absence of bacteria was more likely when files were cleaned in the thermal disinfector. no bacteria were detected from files that were-subjected to steam sterilization irrespective of the type of prior cleaning procedure. conclusions: steam sterilization eliminated all bacteria from the endodontic files irrespective of the presence of biological debris. the majority of bacteria were eliminated from endodontic files after either ultrasonic cleaning or using a thermal disinfector.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a  second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.

TI  == [dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == antibacterial activity of synthetic human b defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. human b defensin-2 (hbd-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or  stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. this peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. therefore, it is thought that hbd-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. however, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 was tested against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and escherichia coli. antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were  performed in vitro. the antibacterial activity of hbd-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. furthermore, the activity of  hbd-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. our results suggest the possibility that synthetic  hbd-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.

AB  == periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases, in these days, and the  passive immunization is one of the most effective approaches for prevention. for  this purpose, we have constructed mouse and human monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the porphyromonas gingivalis-associated hemagglutination and coaggregation. in addition, an artificial antibody, single-chain variable fraction, or scfv, which also inhibited the hemagglutination, was constructed. specifically for dental caries, mouse and human monoclonal antibodies that inhibited the glucosyltransferase (gtf) activity, responsible for biofilm formation, were also constructed. the advantage of scfv over the native antibody  is that the former molecule does not induce possible side-effects due to fc, such as autoimmune disease, because it consists only of variable regions originating from both heavy and light chains. to increase the abilities of the antibody preparations, we attempted to construct an additional scfv using bacillus brevis, a secretion-proficient gram-positive bacterium, as a host cell. an scfv protein possessing the same biological activity as that of the parental antibody was successfully secreted from a b. brevis transformant following the construction of a chimeric shuttle plasmid, which was accomplished by employing a new heterodimer system.

AB  == aims: to determine the expediency of a microtitre assay system for establishing,  quantifying and antimicrobial testing of two representative oral pathogens. methods and results: streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used. morphological characteristics of the attached population were evaluated. biofilm  growth was evaluated spectrophotometrically (undisturbed and 1 n naoh dissipated  biofilm). the minimum concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate that inhibited biofilm growth was determined. growth of the biofilms was successfully monitored  by direct optical density measurements or those re-suspended in 1 n naoh. the latter was necessary when glucans were present in strep. mutans biofilms. the minimum concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate that inhibited biofilm growth was 1.25 microg ml(-1) for both species. the attached bacteria exhibited common biofilm characteristics. significance and impact of the study: the assay system developed was especially useful for monitoring the growth of adherent strep. mutans in the presence of glucans, which is particularly significant for the study of anti-plaque chemicals.

TI  == microbial/host interactions: mechanisms involved in host responses to microbial antigens.
AB  == the indigenous oral microflora and the host are normally in a state of equilibrium; however, the introduction of a pathogen can result in innate and adaptive immune responses that either contribute to the development of the disease or lead to host immunity. the interactions between the microorganisms and the host are very dynamic, thus allowing the complex interplay between host molecules and bacterial antigens. in this article, we focus on the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of and host responses to two oral pathogens: the gram-negative bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease, and the gram-positive streptococcus mutans, a primary agent  involved in dental caries formation. furthermore, we address mechanisms involved  in the ability of select adjuvants and delivery systems to potentiate mucosal and systemic immune responses to microbial vaccine antigens.

TI  == [an in vitro study of the action of kola nitida on bacterial strains implicated in dental caries and periodontal diseases].
AB  == the nitida kola is a substance extracted from the kolanut. in west africa its use by chewing is widespread among the manding people. it's said to have tonic, stimulant and aphrodisiac characteristics and even recent studies have shown that it has antibacterial characteristics. the aim of this study is to make an estimation of the nitida kola's effects on different bacterial species involved in the two main oral and dental pathologies (teeth decays and periodontal illnesses). the obtained results indicate that the kola extract is not effectual  against the tried-out bacteria at regular dose used by chewing.

TI  == 3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  == the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.

TI  == role of the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein in the development of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. p. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the p. gingivalis major fimbrial fima protein and the  species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial mfa1 protein with the streptococcal sspb protein. this study examined the contribution of the mfa1-sspb interaction to p. gingivalis biofilm formation. p. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of s. gordonii dl1 but not on streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of sspb. an insertional inactivation  of the mfa1 gene in p. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in s. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that p. gingivalis biofilms formed on enterococcus faecalis strains expressing sspb or translational fusions  of sspb with spap (the non-adherent sspb homologue in s. mutans) containing the p. gingivalis adherence domain (sspb adherence region, bar) of sspb. in contrast, an isogenic ssp null mutant of s. gordonii dl1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to p. gingivalis fima at levels similar to  wild-type s. gordonii dl1. finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in bar resulted in sspb polypeptides that did not promote the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. these results suggest that the induction of p. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional sspb-minor fimbriae interactions.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == passive immunization against dental caries and periodontal disease: development of recombinant and human monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == indigenous micro-organisms in the oral cavity can cause two major diseases, dental caries and periodontal diseases. there is neither agreement nor consensus  as to the actual mechanisms of pathogenesis of the specific virulence factors of  these micro-organisms. the complexity of the bacterial community in dental plaque has made it difficult for the single bacterial agent of dental caries to be determined. however, there is considerable evidence that streptococcus mutans is  implicated as the primary causative organism of dental caries, and the cell-surface protein antigen (sa i/ii) as well as glucosyltransferases (gtfs) produced by s. mutans appear to be major colonization factors. various forms of periodontal diseases are closely associated with specific subgingival bacteria. porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as an important etiological agent of adult periodontitis. adherence of bacteria to host tissues is a prerequisite for  colonization and one of the important steps in the disease process. bacterial coaggregation factors and hemagglutinins likely play major roles in colonization  in the subgingival area. emerging evidence suggests that inhibition of these virulence factors may protect the host against caries and periodontal disease. active and passive immunization approaches have been developed for immunotherapy  of these diseases. recent advances in mucosal immunology and the introduction of  novel strategies for inducing mucosal immune responses now raise the possibility  that effective and safe vaccines can be constructed. in this regard, some successful results have been reported in animal experimental models. nevertheless, since the public at large might be skeptical about the seriousness  of oral diseases, immunotherapy must be carried out with absolute safety. for this goal to be achieved, the development of safe antibodies for passive immunization is significant and important. in this review, salient advances in passive immunization against caries and periodontal diseases are summarized, and  the biotechnological approaches for developing recombinant and human-type antibodies are introduced. furthermore, our own attempts to construct single-chain variable fragments (scfv) and human-type antibodies capable of neutralizing virulence factors are discussed.

TI  == the microbiota of young children from tooth and tongue samples.
AB  == this study determined the frequency with which 38 microbial species were detected in 171 randomly selected children from 6 to 36 months of age. children were sampled and dental caries measured. oral samples were assayed by means of a checkerboard dna probe assay. the detection frequencies from tongue samples in children under 18 mos were: s. mutans 70%, s. sobrinus 72%, p. gingivalis 23%, b. forsythus 11%, and a. actinomycetemcomitans 30%, with similar detection frequencies in children over 18 mos. thus, s. mutans and the periodontal pathogens, p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, were detected even in the youngest subjects. species associated with caries included s. mutans (children ages 18-36  mos) and a. israelii (children ages < 18 mos), the latter species possibly reflecting increased plaque in children with caries. species detection from tooth and tongue samples was highly associated, with most species detected more frequently from tongue than from tooth samples in children under 18 mos, suggesting that the tongue was a potential microbial reservoir.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == adrenomedullin expression in pathogen-challenged oral epithelial cells.
AB  == adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide, is expressed by many surface epithelial cells and, previously, we have demonstrated that adrenomedullin has antimicrobial activity. the oral cavity contains an epithelium that is permanently colonized by microflora, yet infections in a host are rare. we exposed oral keratinocytes to whole, live cells from four microorganisms commonly isolated from the oral cavity, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and eikenella corrodens. there was upregulation of protein and gene expression in these cells in response to bacterial suspensions, but not with the yeast, candida albicans. we propose there is a potential role for microbial products in enhancing mucosal defense mechanisms and that adrenomedullin participates in the prevention of local infection, thus contributing to host defense mechanisms.

TI  == discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == for pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide, designated bar. however, it does not adhere to streptococcus mutans, which expresses spap, a highly conserved homolog of sspb. comparison of the predicted secondary structure of bar with the corresponding region of spap suggested that the substitution of asn for gly1182 and val for pro1185 in sspb may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in spap. a synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of sspb promoted avid adherence of p. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to bar in spap was inactive. substitution of gly1182 and pro1185 for asn1182 and val1185 in sspb by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an spap-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote p. gingivalis adherence. furthermore, enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of p. gingivalis cells. in contrast, p. gingivalis adhered efficiently to e. faecalis strains expressing intact sspb or sspb-spap chimeric proteins containing bar. these results suggest that a region of sspb consisting of 26 amino acids is  sufficient to mediate the adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii and that the  species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of sspb that is not conserved in spap.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == the sensitivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum to different (pseudo)halide-peroxidase combinations compared with mutans streptococci.
AB  == previous studies have shown that the peroxidase system with iodide is particularly effective against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in the present study, the effects of iodide, chloride and thiocyanate in combinations with lactoperoxidase (lp) and myeloperoxidase (mp) on the viability of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and s. rattus were analysed. bacteria were incubated in buffer solution containing peroxidase, substrate(s) and h2o2 (all in oral physiological concentrations), and plated after 0, 0.5 and 1 h. the oxidation product of iodide was the most bactericidal against all the bacteria tested. the effect was significantly weaker on mutans streptococci. physiological concentrations of thiocyanate abolished the effects of lp-h2o2-iodide and mp-h2o2-iodide/chloride combinations. thiocyanate-peroxidase systems have already been used in oral hygiene products. the incorporation of iodide into these products could make them much more potent  against periodontal pathogens, and also help to prevent transmission of these pathogens from person to person via saliva.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the retention of three species of pathogenic microorganisms by three different types of toothbrush.
AB  == the retention and survival of microorganisms on toothbrushes pose a threat of recontamination for certain patients at risk. in order to measure the influence of brush design and optimize the choice of toothbrush model for complementary studies, the in vitro retention of three microbial species (porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and candida albicans atcc  26555) was evaluated for three types of toothbrush. two series of standardized experiments were carried out for each brush and microorganism. the first series tested the retention of the microorganisms on the head portion of the brush, while the second measured retention on the head of the brush and the part of the  handle inserted in the mouth during brushing. for each series, the microorganisms were counted at t0 and t24 (after storage of the brushes at room temperature for  24 h). depending on the microorganism studied, from 0.2% to 2% of the initial inoculum was retained on the brush. the number detected increased with the size of the exposed area. after 24 h, p. gingivalis and s. mutans were found on only one type of brush. c. albicans survived on all three. these results confirm that  microorganisms can quickly colonize toothbrushes.

TI  == red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == large-scale synthesis and functional elements for the antimicrobial activity of defensins.
AB  == human neutrophil defensins, and their analogues incorporating anionic, hydrophobic or cationic residues at the n- and c-termini, were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. the synthetic defensins were examined for their microbicidal activity against candida albicans, two gram-negative bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) and two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans). the human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp1) and hnp2 were found to be potent candidacidal agents. hnp3, which differs by one amino acid at the n-terminus of its sequence,  was totally inactive. the gram-negative bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p.  gingivalis and the gram-positive bacteria s. gordonii and s. mutans were insensitive to human defensins. however, the insertion of two basic residues, such as arginine, at both the n-terminus and the c-terminus of hnp2 significantly enhanced antifungal and antibacterial activity. the addition of anionic residues, such as aspartic acid, at the n- and c-termini rendered the molecule totally inactive. the presence of two hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, at the n-terminus of hnp2 and of two basic arginine residues at its c-terminus resulted  in molecules that were optimally active against these oral pathogens. the results suggest that the n- and c-terminal residues in defensin peptides are the crucial  functional elements that determine their microbicidal potency. the three-dimensional structure of all defensins constitutes the same amphiphilic beta-sheet structure, with the polar face formed by the n- and c-terminal residues playing an important role in defining microbicidal potency and the antimicrobial spectrum. the enhanced microbicidal activity observed for defensin  peptides with two basic residues at both the n- and c-termini could be due to optimization of the amphiphilicity of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial membranes.

TI  == namibian chewing stick, diospyros lycioides, contains antibacterial compounds against oral pathogens.
AB  == the twigs of diospyros lycioides, a plant commonly known as "muthala", are frequently used as chewing sticks for the cleaning of teeth by rural and urban people in namibia. preliminary studies showed that a methanol extract of d. lycioides inhibited growth of selected oral pathogens. subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of four novel bioactive naphthalene glycosides, diospyrosides a, b, c, and d (1-4), and two known bioactive naphthoquinones, juglone (5) and 7-methyljuglone (6). the structures of the new compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques including 1d and 2d nmr. these compounds inhibited the growth of oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis) and periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 1.25 mg/ml. juglone exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity among these compounds.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  == accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. in subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria increases. as the gingival junctional epithelium (je) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of ltas (from streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis) and lpss (from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (hacat and erm) and  a culture model for human je. the cells were exposed to the ltas or lpss (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. none of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the je cultures. however, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in  all cultures treated with ltas. in contrast, lpss showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. this suggests that lpss, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. however, the ltas appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal je and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == coinvasion of dentinal tubules by porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii depends upon binding specificity of streptococcal antigen i/ii adhesin.
AB  == cell wall-anchored polypeptides of the antigen i/ii family are produced by many species of oral streptococci. these proteins mediate adhesion of streptococci to  salivary glycoproteins and to other oral microorganisms and promote binding of cells to collagen type i and invasion of dentinal tubules. since infections of the root canal system have a mixed anaerobic bacterial etiology, we investigated  the hypothesis that coadhesion of anaerobic bacteria with streptococci may facilitate invasive endodontic disease. porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 cells were able to invade dentinal tubules when cocultured with streptococcus gordonii  dl1 (challis) but not when cocultured with streptococcus mutans ng8. an isogenic  noninvasive mutant of s. gordonii, with production of sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides abrogated, was deficient in binding to collagen and had a 40% reduced ability to support adhesion of p. gingivalis. heterologous expression of the s. mutans spap (antigen i/ii) protein in this mutant restored collagen binding and tubule invasion but not adhesion to p. gingivalis or the ability to promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. an isogenic afimbrial mutant of p. gingivalis had 50% reduced binding to s. gordonii cells but was unaffected in the ability to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii wild-type cells. expression of the s. gordonii sspa or sspb polypeptide on the surface of lactococcus lactis  cells endowed these bacteria with the abilities to bind p. gingivalis, penetrate  dentinal tubules, and promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. the results demonstrate that collagen-binding and p. gingivalis-binding properties of antigen i/ii polypeptides are discrete functions. specificity of antigen i/ii polypeptide recognition accounts for the ability of p. gingivalis to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii but not with s. mutans. this provides evidence that the  specificity of interbacterial coadhesion may influence directly the etiology of pulpal and periapical diseases.

TI  == synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == effects of mutans streptococci, actinomyces species and porphyromonas gingivalis  on collagen degradation.
AB  == background: while streptococcus mutans and actinomyces spp are considered to be major pathogenic microorganisms of root caries, their roles in the degradation of organic matrix components of human root dentin need clarification. methods: ten laboratory strains and 11 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and actinomyces species, and positive bacterial or purified enzyme controls (porphyromonas gingivalis whole cell lysates, trypsin or clostridial collagenase) were used to establish the degradation of azocollagen (ac), insoluble type i collagen (ic) or human dentin collagen (dc) from dentin powder in two types of experiments investigating collagenolytic activity either during or after bacterial growth. ultraviolet-irradiated dentin powder and gamma-irradiated ic were used to assess the collagenolytic activity of test strains during bacterial  growth. ac, ic and acid-treated dentin powder were used to determine the collagenolytic activity of sonicated bacterial whole cells and cell-free culture  supernatants recovered from test strains after growth. hydroxyproline or spectrophotometric assays were used to analyze the level of degraded collagen. results: data from this study showed that in contrast to the positive controls, none of the laboratory strains or clinical isolates elicited significant degradation of ac, ic or dc. conclusions: results indicated that mutans streptococci and actinomyces species had no significant collagenolytic activity,  but may be involved in the root caries process through other mechanisms. in addition, proteolytic enzymes from other oral bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis or from host cells such as neutrophils may also participate in the pathogenesis of root caries.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

AB  == the tandem repeat 23-residue sequence [trs23 (145-167): t-t-a-a-p-p-t-p-s-a-t-t-p-a-p-p-s-s-s-a-p-p-e] of human salivary mucin glycoprotein mg2 was examined for its in vitro bactericidal activity against four oral microorganisms, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus mutans. the conformational  features of the proline-rich peptide were determined by circular dichroism (cd) and 600 mhz two-dimensional (2d) nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) in aqueous solution. the strains of p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are highly sensitive to this  peptide at 1.5-3.0 microm concentrations, suggesting that the proline-rich repeat sequence is a potent bactericidal agent for oral pathogens. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances was accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated spectroscopy and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and the 1h-2h exchange effect on amide nh resonances suggest the absence of intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded nh groups. the coupling constant (jnh-calphah) values, conformational restriction offered by the proline residues (phi = -60 degrees +/- 15 degrees), the set of medium- and short-range nuclear overhauser effects observed for this sequence, and the results of restrained structure calculation using diana, the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications, provide evidence for the existence of a significant population of poly-l-proline  ii-type helices in aqueous solution. the cd spectra of the peptide in phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) and in methanol are reminiscent of the cd spectrum of the poly-l-proline ii helical conformation and are consistent with the nmr data. the  bactericidal activity of the proline-rich repeat sequence suggests that bacterial colonization, facilitated by the adsorbed salivary mucins on tooth surface, could be partly controlled and cleared by proteolytically degraded proline-rich peptides of mg2 in saliva before the colonized organisms turn into pathogens. it  appears that the poly-l-proline ii helix is the biologically active backbone conformation for bactericidal activity of the tandem repeat sequences of salivary mg2.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == binaphthalenone glycosides from african chewing sticks, diospyros lycioides.
AB  == our laboratory has engaged in the exploration of active antimicrobial principles  present in chewing sticks commonly used by the african and middle eastern countries as a mechanical oral hygiene aid in place of tooth brushing. during this investigation, a methanol extract from the twigs of diospyros lycioides, a namibia tooth cleaning stick, demonstrated antimicrobial activity against common  oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis (mics  2.5 and 0.156 mg/ml). subsequent fractionation and purification of this extract led to the identification of two novel binaphathalenone glycosides: 1', 2-binaphthalen-4-one-2',3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8, 8'-hexahydroxy-8-o-beta-glucopyranosyl-5'-o-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-- >6) -beta-glucopyranoside (1) and 1',2-binaphthalen-4-one-2', 3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8,8'-hexahydroxy-5', 8-di-o-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside (2). their structures were  established using spectroscopic techniques. examination of the antimicrobial activity of these two compounds revealed positive but only marginal growth inhibition against the test cariogenic pathogens, s. sanguis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == anti-bacterial action of onion (allium cepa l.) extracts against oral pathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the focus was on the antibacterial activity of onions. this study  researched the activities of onion extracts on streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, the main causal bacteria for dental caries, and porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, considered to be the main causal bacteria of adult periodontitis. the results showed that the onion extracts possess an effect on all test bacterial strains (s.mutans jc-2, s. sobrinus omz176, p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. intermedia atcc 25611), and the  effects were bactericidal against cultured and resting bacterial cells. the activity of the onion extracts was stable even after 48 hours in the culture medium. this result suggests that no decomposition or volatility of onion extracts occurred in the culture medium. the antibacterial activity of onion extracts was not markedly influenced by cysteine (10 mm) treatment. however, activity significantly decreased with alkali treatment. grated onion left to stand at 37 degrees c for 48 hours did not show antibacterial activity. also, activity of steam treated (100 degrees c, 10 min.) onion was not observed. using  avicel plate by thin layer chromatography with the solvent of n-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:3:1), the main component of the substance (the substance which develops color with ninhydrin) was observed at an rf value of about 0.9.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus gordonii sspb domain that mediates adhesion to  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary pathogen in adult periodontitis, may establish itself in the oral cavity by adhering to early plaque bacteria such as  streptococcus gordonii. our previous studies (r. j. lamont et al., microbiology 140:867-872, 1994) suggested that this interaction is mediated by the sspb polypeptide, a member of the antigen i/ii family of streptococcal surface proteins. s. gordonii was recently shown to express a second ssp polypeptide (sspa) that resembles sspb and the structurally homologous antigen i/ii polypeptide (pac) of streptococcus mutans. to determine if all of these related antigen i/ii proteins interacted with p. gingivalis, sspa, sspb, and pac were tested for adhesion to p. gingivalis cells. both of the s. gordonii ssp proteins  bound labeled target cells, whereas the s. mutans pac polypeptide did not, suggesting that antigen i/ii-mediated binding of p. gingivalis by streptococci may be species specific. to investigate the molecular basis for this functional difference, the p. gingivalis binding domain of sspb was mapped. the binding properties of a family of truncated sspb polypeptides lacking c-terminal sequences were determined. in addition, the lack of binding activity exhibited by the pac protein was exploited to construct and analyze chimeric sspb-pac polypeptides. both approaches revealed that the region defined by residues 1167 to 1250 of sspb was essential for p. gingivalis binding. this region of sspa and  sspb is entirely conserved, consistent with the binding properties determined for these proteins. however, the corresponding region of pac differs in both the primary sequence and predicted secondary structure, suggesting that the overall structure of this domain may define its functional activity.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-8 production in mononuclear cells stimulated by oral microorganisms.
AB  == chemokines are a family of low-molecular-weight proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. chemokine expression contributes to the presence of different leukocyte populations observed in normal and pathologic states. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were stimulated by microbes (candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) selected based upon their importance as oral pathogens. il-8 and mcp-1 gene expression and protein release were determined by northern blot (rna blot) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. c. albicans, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans induced high levels of production of both mcp-1 and il-8. s. mutans was a strong inducer of mcp-1, but it did not stimulate significant production of il-8. c. albicans, s. mutans, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 500 to 5,000 times more potent than p. gingivalis in terms of mcp-1 production. in general, the microbe-to-pbmc ratios required for maximum gene expression of mcp-1 were lower than those for il-8. however, for actual protein release of mcp-1 versus il-8, differences in the effects of various microbe concentrations were observed only for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results demonstrate that different oral pathogens induce specific dose-dependent patterns of chemokine gene expression and release. such patterns may help explain the immunopathology of oral infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles promote bacterial resistance to  chlorhexidine.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been frequently associated with some types of periodontal diseases and possesses various mechanisms favoring the pathogenic process. it has been recently observed that vesicles elaborated by p. gingivalis  are able to protect bacteria from the bactericidal activity of human serum. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the ability of vesicles from p.  gingivalis in protecting oral bacteria against chlorhexidine. data indicate that  vesicles released by p. gingivalis may bind chlorhexidine, thus allowing protection for itself and for other oral bacterial species. it has also been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides are the major component involved in the binding of chlorhexidine by vesicles. the mechanism of resistance reported in this study indicates that bacterial interactions in the oral cavity may influence the sensitivity of microbes.

AB  == the overall objective with the present investigations was to study the influence  of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) on periodontal conditions and to identify factors that may be predictors for severe periodontal disease in individuals with iddm. periodontal conditions were studied in two cross-sectional studies of adult, insulin-dependent diabetics and age-and sex-matched controls. in one study 72 diabetics with short-(sd) and 82 with long-duration (ld) diabetes and 77 controls participated. in the other study 83 ld diabetics and 99 controls  took part. the portion of individuals exhibiting severe periodontal disease was larger in the diabetic group than in the control group. advanced periodontal disease appeared in earlier ages (40-49 years) in the ld diabetics compared to the sd diabetics and controls. in fact, the 40-49-year-old ld diabetics had alveolar bone loss equal to the older controls (60-69 years). ld diabetics exhibited more severe periodontitis than sd diabetics. some salivary factors were studied in 72 sd and 82 ld diabetics and 77 controls. ld and sd diabetics had a lower stimulated salivary secretion rate and an increased glucose content compared to the controls. the reduction in flow rate, however, was moderate, and  all mean values were within the normal limits. the moderately increased glucose content did not result in higher mean numbers of candida albicans, lactobacilli,  and mutans streptococci. the subgingival bacterial species currently considered to be associated with periodontitis were studied in 30 ld diabetics and 34 controls. all these bacterial species were recovered in diabetics as well as controls. more ld diabetics than controls harboured porphyromonas gingivalis. in  the control group the periopathogens were recovered more often in deep periodontal pockets. in the ld group, however, these bacterial species were recovered as often in shallow as in deep periodontal pockets. the medical status  of 39 matched pairs of ld diabetics was analysed. one in each pair had severe periodontal disease while the other had no/minor symptoms of periodontal disease. biochemical analyses and clinical variables routinely used in monitoring diabetics failed to discriminate between diabetics with severe and minor periodontal disease. diabetics with severe periodontal disease, however, showed a higher prevalence of renal disease and cardiovascular complications such as stroke, transient ischemic attacks, angina, myocardial infarct, heart failure, and claudicatio intermittens than diabetics with only minor periodontal disease.  this indicates that closer cooperation between the diabetologist and the dentist  is necessary in monitoring the diabetic patient.

TI  == an investigation of diterpenes from the leaves of rabdosia trichocarpa and their  antibacterial activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the ethanolic extract of rabdosia trichocarpa leaves showed antibacterial activity against cariogenic mutans streptococci and periodontopathic porphyromonas gingivalis. chromatographic separation and purification of the extract afforded ten diterpenes, including one novel ent-kauren type compound named trichoranin. some of these compounds possess potent antibacterial activity  against these oral micro-organisms, indicating that these diterpenes may be useful natural substances for the maintenance of oral health.

TI  == molecules of streptococcus gordonii that bind to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as streptococcus gordonii. in this study, the molecules of s. gordonii g9b that mediate binding to p. gingivalis were investigated. biotinylated surface molecules of s. gordonii were extracted and mixed with p. gingivalis cells. interactive streptococcal components were identified by sds-page of the p. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. s. gordonii molecules of 45 kda and a doublet of 62/60 kda were observed to bind to p. gingivalis. polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kda proteins inhibited the  binding interaction. these antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kda molecules and the 45 kda protein. both molecules were also  antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of  170 kda which is antigenically related to the p1 antigen of s. mutans. cloning and expression in enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the p1-like molecule from s. gordonii m5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kda and 45 kda antigens and was capable of binding to p. gingivalis. these results suggest that  a p1-like molecule in s. gordonii is involved in adherence to p. gingivalis. processing of the p1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kda and 45 kda may be required for binding activity.

TI  == adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci.
AB  == coaggregation occurred between porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci.  the coaggregation was completely inhibited by l-arginine, n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), and a trypsin inhibitor, and weakly inhibited by l-lysine, n-ethylmaleimide, lysozyme, and human whole saliva. the results of heat and proteinase k treatment suggested that a heat-labile proteinaceous substance of p. gingivalis and a heat-stable substance of mutans streptococci may play a role in the coaggregation. mutans streptococci also aggregated in the presence of the heat-labile factor in the supernatant of p. gingivalis. the aggregation was also inhibited by l-arginine, tlck, and a trypsin inhibitor.

TI  == a comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

TI  == transmission of oral bacterial species between spouses.
AB  == the transmission of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci was studied between 4 married couples who suffered from advanced periodontitis. of the 20 couples investigated, the 4 in which both spouses harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were chosen for the transmission study. three of these couples also harbored mutans streptococci. a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (8-24 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (5-23 per subject) were serotyped by immunodiffusion technique. for ribotyping, chromosomal dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (4-5 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (4-11 per subject) was digested with restriction endonucleases clai or bgli and hindiii or smai, respectively. p. gingivalis isolates (2-15 per subject) were ribotyped by using clai, bgli and smai. the blotted restriction fragments were hybridized to the plasmid pkk3535, which contains the rrna operon of the e. coli chromosome. the spouses in 2 couples shared the same sero- and ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans. p. gingivalis ribotypes were identical in 2  couples. the result suggests transmission of oral bacteria between spouses.

TI  == bacteriology of dental infections.
AB  == the most common dental diseases, periodontal disease and dental caries, are chronic infections caused by bacteria of normal oral flora. when these bacteria increase in number and irritation exceeds the host defence threshold, disease arises. the human oral flora comprises more than 300 different bacteria. during the last decade approximately 10 species, mainly gram-negative anaerobes, have been noted as putative pathogens in periodontal disease. the gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic mutans streptococci are aetiologically the most important bacteria in dental caries. data have rapidly increased on the association of these bacteria with certain periodontal diseases or caries, on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and transmission among family members. chronic dental infections have been the focus of renewed interest because of recent advances in oral microbiology as well as in medicine. we now know that in addition to oral streptococci, recently classified, fastidious periodontal anaerobes can be detected from various extra-oral infections. oral bacteria may spread into the blood stream through ulcerated epithelium in diseased periodontal pockets and cause transient bacteraemias, which are regarded as increased risk, especially for immunocompromised patients or persons with endoprotheses. in these patients,  routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental care procedures. also the new association between dental infections and myocardial/cerebral infarction have offered new challenges for cooperation between dental and medical researchers.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == levels of salivary iga antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.

TI  == agglutination of streptococcus mutans serotype c cells but inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis autoaggregation by human lactoferrin.
AB  == the ability of various forms of human lactoferrin (lf) to agglutinate oral streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. rattus, strep. sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells was studied spectrophotometrically. fe3+ saturated lf was unable to agglutinate these bacteria, whereas iron-free lf (apo lf) effectively agglutinated strep. mutans cells but not the other bacteria. the efficiency and rate of agglutination of strep. mutans were somewhat lower with apo lf than with human whole saliva. however, secretory iga, phosphate and whole saliva almost totally abolished the apo lf-mediated agglutination of strep. mutans, suggesting binding to the same target sites on bacterial cell surfaces, or to each other. the presence of exogenous iron (fe2+, fe3+), lactoperoxidase or serum albumin did not affect the  agglutination by apo lf. low ca2+ (50-100 microns) slightly enhanced the agglutination by apo lf but higher concentrations (0.5-1.0 mm) totally blocked the apo lf-mediated agglutination of strep. mutans. both saliva and apo lf significantly delayed the rapid autoaggregation of p. gingivalis cells. aggregation of p. gingivalis is considered a potential virulence factor and a protective mechanism against the host's cellular defences in the gingival crevice. these findings show a novel, strain-specific antibacterial mechanism for lf against strep. mutans and p. gingivalis and adds a new compound to the group of agglutinating proteins in human saliva.

TI  == an analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == the distribution and interrelationship of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and bana scores among older adults.
AB  == in a random sample of subgingival dental plaque samples from 375 blacks and 300 whites aged 65 and older, immunofluorescence assays for 3 target pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, and bana enzyme analysis were carried out. blacks had significantly greater proportions of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in their subgingival plaque and had significantly higher bana scores. these assay results  were investigated for concordance with each other and with 2 cariogenic salivary  bacteria, streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli. in general for both races, the periodontal pathogens were more likely to occur in combination with each other than with either s. mutans or lactobacilli. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were  more frequently associated with each other than with a. actinomycetemcomitans. there was a significant negative concordance between bana and a. actinomycetemcomitans in whites and a significant positive concordance between bana and p. intermedia in blacks.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
AB  == western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used,  but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.

TI  == [ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
AB  == this study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. bacterial strains used in this study, were fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mutans omz 176. the bacterial  cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-k1, l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (n2: 80%, co2:  10%, h2: 10%). the effect of environmental eh and ph on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and eh and ph tolerance tests were also undertaken. the environmental ph decreased from ph 7.0 to ph 4.9 accompanied with the growth of s. mutans omz 176 and s. sanguis atcc 10557 in both single and mixed culture. the environmental eh increased from -308 mv to -180 mv accompanied with the growth of s. sanguis atcc 10557. the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with eh and ph. especially, the growth of p. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below ph 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 was strongly inhibited at eh -100 mv in an eh tolerance test. the oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of s. sanguis atcc 10557. therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by s. sanguis atcc 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. these results suggest that the high eh and the low ph generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.

TI  == effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius.
AB  == the effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius was investigated. b. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a ph as low as 5.0. these bacteria grew almost as well as streptococcus mutans at ph 5.0 and  better than actinomyces viscosus at ph 5.5 and 5.0. some b. intermedius strains raised the culture ph when grown at a low ph without glucose. in contrast, p. gingivalis strains grew only at ph 6.5 to 7.0. the p. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the b. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. b. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at ph 7.0, and high activity over a wide ph range. in contrast, the optimum ph of proteolytic activity in p. gingivalis was ph 7.5 to 8.0. the p. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of b. intermedius to low ph. the capacity of b. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low ph might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. these differences between b. intermedius and p. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how b. intermedius might positively influence the growth of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
