TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-s), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 bacteroides fragilis, 42 b. thetaiotaomicron, 10 b. vulgatus, 7 b. ovatus, 6 b. uniformis, 6 b. distasonis, 7 bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 bacteroides oralis group, 21 clostridium difficile, 7 c. perfringens, 3 c. sporogenes, 3 clostridium spp., 33 propionibacterium acnes, 14 peptococcaceae) were studied by  means of agar dilution tests. the mic90 of b. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. the respective mic90's of b. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. strains of the other bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than b. thetaiotaomicron.  against clostridium difficile flomoxef (mic90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. most of the clostridium strains other  than c. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (mic90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
