TI  == susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  == in this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin,  which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. most of the bacteria tested  (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, pasteurella multocida and bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin mic(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. solely proteus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher mic(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. only six (3.4%) of 177 s. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 e. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin mics of >/= 2 mug/ml. analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in gyra that resulted in amino acid exchanges s83l+d87n or s83l+d87y and single or double mutations in parc that resulted in amino acid exchanges s80i or s80i+e84g  in all 12 e. coli isolates. the six s. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino  acid exchanges s84l or e88k in gyra and s80i in grla. comparative analysis of the mics of pradofloxacin and the mics determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens s. pseudintermedius, e. coli and p. multocida. this comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin mics were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.
