update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the united states: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) 2005 to 2007.
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (ttest) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. objective: the aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the united states in 2005, 2006, and 2007. methods: isolates were collected from 172 centers across the united states.in vitro activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines and clsi or us food and drug administration interpretive criteria. results: overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. for the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. one exception was acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for esbl-pproducing escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/l against non-esbl-producing k pneumoniae, k oxytoca, e coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and a baumannii. against methicillin susceptible and -resistant s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline mic(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/l. conclusions: this report of 3 years of data from the test study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for a baumannii. tigecycline continued to have good activity against enterobacteriaceae, a baumannii, s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and s agalactiae.
[post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
