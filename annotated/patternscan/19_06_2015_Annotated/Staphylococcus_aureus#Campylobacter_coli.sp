TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == application of bacteriophages in post-harvest control of human pathogenic and food spoiling bacteria.
AB  == bacteriophages have attracted great attention for application in food biopreservation. lytic bacteriophages specific for human pathogenic bacteria can  be isolated from natural sources such as animal feces or industrial wastes where  the target bacteria inhabit. lytic bacteriophages have been tested in different food systems for inactivation of main food-borne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica, shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni and cronobacter sakazkii, and also  for control of spoilage bacteria. application of lytic bacteriophages could selectively control host populations of concern without interfering with the remaining food microbiota. bacteriophages could also be applied for inactivation  of bacteria attached to food contact surfaces or grown as biofilms. bacteriophages may receive a generally recognized as safe status based on their lack of toxicity and other detrimental effects to human health. phage preparations specific for l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7 and s. enterica serotypes have been commercialized and approved for application in foods or as part of surface decontamination protocols. phage endolysins have a broader host specificity compared to lytic bacteriophages. cloned endolysins could be used as  natural preservatives, singly or in combination with other antimicrobials such as bacteriocins.

TI  == acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. twenty-seven cattle with  hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. in 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. the most frequent species occurring  in the liver were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was candida  spp., followed by streptococcus spp., mannheimia haemolytica, corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and s. aureus. the concentration of serum interleukin (il-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than  that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (p0.05). the highest concentrations of il-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + trichostrongylus sp. (p< 0.001). consequently, saa showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. it was noticed that il-6, like saa, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. therefore il-6 and saa appear to be major markers in the detection of  infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.

TI  == the livestock reservoir for antimicrobial resistance: a personal view on changing patterns of risks, effects of interventions and the way forward.
AB  == the purpose of this review was to provide an updated overview on the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock, the associated problems for humans and current knowledge on the effects of reducing resistance in the livestock reservoir on both human health and animal production. there is still limiting data on both use of antimicrobial agents, occurrence and spread of resistance as well as impact on human health. however, in recent years, emerging issues related to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and horizontally transferred genes indicates that the livestock reservoir has a more significant impact on human health than was estimated 10 years ago, where the focus was mainly on resistance in campylobacter and salmonella. studies have indicated that there might only be a marginal if any benefit from the regular use of antibiotics and have shown that it is possible to substantially reduce the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock production without compromising animal welfare or health or production. in some cases, this should be done in combination with other measures such as biosecurity and use of vaccines. to enable better studies on both the global burden and the effect of interventions, there is a need for global harmonized integrated and continuous surveillance of antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance, preferably associated with data on production and animal diseases to determine the positive  and negative impact of reducing antimicrobial use in livestock.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == increased efficiency of campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb by  structure-guided engineering.
AB  == conjugate vaccines belong to the most efficient preventive measures against life-threatening bacterial infections. functional expression of n-oligosaccharyltransferase (n-ost) pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enables a simplified production of glycoconjugate vaccines in prokaryotic cells. polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria can be covalently coupled to immunogenic acceptor proteins bearing engineered glycosylation sites. transfer efficiency of pglbcj is low for certain heterologous polysaccharide substrates. in this study, we increased glycosylation rates for salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium lt2 o antigen (which lacks n-acetyl sugars) and staphylococcus aureus cp5 polysaccharides by structure-guided engineering of pglb. a three-dimensional  homology model of membrane-associated pglbcj, docked to the natural c. jejuni n-glycan attached to the acceptor peptide, was used to identify potential sugar-interacting residues as targets for mutagenesis. saturation mutagenesis of  an active site residue yielded the enhancing mutation n311v, which facilitated fivefold to 11-fold increased in vivo glycosylation rates as determined by glycoprotein-specific elisa. further rounds of in vitro evolution led to a triple mutant s80r-q287p-n311v enabling a yield improvement of s. enterica lt2 glycoconjugates by a factor of 16. our results demonstrate that bacterial n-ost can be tailored to specific polysaccharide substrates by structure-guided protein engineering.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of weakly acidified chlorous acid water.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of weakly acidified chlorous acid water (wacaw) against staphylococcus aureus, non-pathogenic escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec o157:h7), candida albicans, and spore-forming bacillus and paenibacillus species was evaluated in vitro. the antiviral activity was also examined using feline calicivirus (fcv). diluted wacaw (>100 ppm) effectively reduced the number of non-spore-forming bacteria (>4 log10 cfu reductions) within 5 min. treatment with this sanitizer at 400 ppm for 30 min achieved>5 log10 cfu reductions in spore-forming bacillus and paenibacillus species while an equivalent concentration of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) resulted in only a 0.98 and 2.72 log10 cfu reduction, respectively. the effect of this sanitizer against  fcv was equivalent to that of naclo. immersion in wacaw (400 ppm) achieved >4 and 2.26 log10 cfu reductions in campylobacter jejuni and ehec, respectively, on artificially contaminated broiler carcass pieces. finally, theantimicrobial activity of this sanitizer was shown to be maintained for at least 28 d when in contact with nonwoven fabric (100% cotton). this study showed that ph control of  chlorous acid is expected to modify its antimicrobial activity and stability. wacaw is expected to have applications in various settings such as the food processing and healthcare industries.

TI  == concentration- and roughness-dependent antibacterial and antifungal activities of cuo thin films and their cu ion cytotoxicity and elution behavior.
AB  == in this study, we aimed to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties,  cytotoxicity, and elution behavior of copper oxide (cuo) thin films with varying  concentrations and roughness values. cuo films greater than 0.2 mol % showed 99.9 % antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, and penicillium funiculosum. cu ions were found to be noncytotoxic in new zealand white rabbits. the concentration of cu ions from cuo  thin films eluted in drinking water in 24 h at 100 degrees c was 0.014 mug l(-1), which was below the standard acceptable level of 0.02 mug l(-1). the transmittance of cuo thin film-coated glass was similar to that of parent glass.  the antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, elution behavior, and transmittance of  cuo deposited on glass suggest that these films could be useful in household devices and display devices.

TI  == phenolic acids profile, antioxidant and antibacterial activity of chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle (asteraceae).
AB  == chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle ethanolic extracts were chemically analysed with respect to phenolics. twelve phenolic acids were separated and identified by hplc-dad and the presence of rosmarinic acid was additionally confirmed by lc-ms. five methods were applied for the evaluation of extracts' antioxidant properties (frap, dpph, abts, chelating activity, briggs-rauscher reaction), while the antibacterial activity was tested against some of the major  food-borne pathogens (campylobacter coli, escherichia coli, salmonella infantis,  bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus). immortelle extract was the richest in phenolics with a dominant flavonoid fraction, while the other two extracts contained higher amount of non-flavonoids. the phenolic acid profile also varied; high concentration of rosmarinic acid was found in chamomile and common yarrow, while caffeic acid was dominant in immortelle. the best antioxidant properties were obtained for chamomile extract, while good antimicrobial activity, especially against gram-positive bacterial species, was detected for immortelle. the obtained results could be used as a tool for chemotaxonomic classification of the investigated plants or for their potential application as natural antioxidants/antimicrobials.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == muddying the waters: a new area of concern for drinking water contamination in cameroon.
AB  == in urban maroua, cameroon, improved drinking water sources are available to a large majority of the population, yet this water is frequently distributed through informal distribution systems and stored in home containers (canaries), leaving it vulnerable to contamination. we assessed where contamination occurs within the distribution system, determined potential sources of environmental contamination, and investigated potential pathogens. gastrointestinal health status (785 individuals) was collected via health surveys. drinking water samples were collected from drinking water sources and canaries. escherichia coli and total coliform levels were evaluated and molecular detection was performed to measure human-associated faecal marker, hf183; tetracycline-resistance gene, tetq; campylobacter spp.; and staphylococcus aureus. statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between microbial contamination and gastrointestinal illness. canari samples had higher levels of contamination than  source samples. hf183 and tetq were detected in home and source samples. an inverse relationship was found between tetq and e. coli. presence of tetq with lower e. coli levels increased the odds of reported diarrhoeal illness than e. coli levels alone. further work is warranted to better assess the relationship between antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and other pathogens in micro-ecosystems  within canaries and this relationship's impact on drinking water quality.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == hijacking bacterial glycosylation for the production of glycoconjugates, from vaccines to humanised glycoproteins.
AB  == objectives: glycosylation or the modification of a cellular component with a carbohydrate moiety has been demonstrated in all three domains of life as a basic post-translational process important in a range of biological processes. this review will focus on the latest studies attempting to exploit bacterial n-linked  protein glycosylation for glycobiotechnological applications including glycoconjugate vaccine and humanised glycoprotein production. the challenges that remain for these approaches to reach full biotechnological maturity will be discussed. key findings: oligosaccharyltransferase-dependent n-linked glycosylation can be exploited to make glycoconjugate vaccines against bacterial  pathogens. few technical limitations remain, but it is likely that the technologies developed will soon be considered a cost-effective and flexible alternative to current chemical-based methods of vaccine production. some highlights from current glycoconjugate vaccines developed using this in-vivo production system include a vaccine against shigella dysenteriae o1 that has passed phase 1 clinical trials, a vaccine against the tier 1 pathogen francisella tularensis that has shown efficacy in mice and a vaccine against staphylococcus aureus serotypes 5 and 8. generation of humanised glycoproteins within bacteria was considered impossible due to the distinct nature of glycan modification in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. we describe the method used to overcome this conundrum to allow engineering of a eukaryotic pentasaccharide core sugar modification within escherichia coli. this core was assembled by combining the function of the initiating transferase weca, several alg genes from saccharomyces cerevisiae and the oligosaccharyltransferase function of the campylobacter jejuni pglb. further exploitation of a cytoplasmic n-linked glycosylation system found in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae where the central enzyme is known as n-linking glycosyltransferase has overcome some of the limitations demonstrated by the oligosaccharyltransferase-dependent system. summary: characterisation of the first bacterial n-linked glycosylation system in the human enteropathogen campylobacter jejuni has led to substantial biotechnological applications. alternative methods for glycoconjugate vaccine production have been developed using this n-linked system. vaccines against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms have been developed, and efficacy testing has thus far demonstrated that the vaccines are safe and that robust immune responses are being detected. these are likely to complement and reduce the cost of current technologies thus opening new avenues for glycoconjugate vaccines. these new markets could potentially include glycoconjugate vaccines tailored specifically for animal vaccination, which has until today thought to be non-viable due to the cost of current in-vitro chemical conjugation methods. utilisation of n-linked glycosylation to generate humanised glycoproteins is also close to becoming reality. this 'bottom up' assembly mechanism removes the heterogeneity seen in current humanised products. the majority of developments reported in this review  exploit a single n-linked glycosylation system from campylobacter jejuni; however, alternative n-linked glycosylation systems have been discovered which should help to overcome current technical limitations and perhaps more systems remain to be discovered. the likelihood is that further glycosylation systems exist and are waiting to be exploited.

TI  == impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. this can compromise  treatment of human infections. in the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in escherichia coli and salmonella. while these are still important the focus has shifted to esbl producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. in addition livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  suddenly emerged in 2007. we also need to consider multi-resistant strains of streptococcus suis. environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == development of 23 individual taqman(r) real-time pcr assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.

AB  == the hydro distillation method was used in this study to get essential oils (eos)  from cumin (cuminum cyminum l.), clove (eugenia caryohyllata) and elecampane (inula helenium l.) and the co-hydro distillation method (addition of fatty acid  ethyl esters as extraction cosolvents) to get functional extracts (efs). the mic  (minimum inhibitory concentration) and the mbc (minimum bactericidal concentration) were determined on five pathogenic strains (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus and toxoplasma gondi). the results showed that essential oils of cumin and clove and  their functional extracts are effective on concentrations from 500 mg/l to 750 mg/l. the essential oils with functional extracts were used on meat samples at three different concentrations: 750, 1,500 and 2,250 mul. the cumin essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log ufc/g with the application of 750 mul, the clove essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log ufc/g with the application of 2,250 mul and the cumin and clove functional extracts got a reduction of 3.6 log  ufc/g. by chromatography, eugenol was identified in the clove oil, cuminaldehyde  in the cumin oil and the isoalactolactones and alactolactones in the elecampane oil as main compounds on the chemical composition of the essential oils and functional extracts obtained.

TI  == decay of genetic markers for fecal bacterial indicators and pathogens in sand from lake superior.
AB  == beach sands impact water quality and pathogen loads, however, the comparative decay of the fecal indicator bacteria (fib) enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli, and pathogens in freshwater sand have not been examined. in this study, freshwater sand microcosms were inoculated with sewage and pure cultures of bacterial pathogens to compare relative decay rates. the abundance of culturable  enterococcus spp. and e. coli, genetic markers for enterococcus spp. (entero1), total bacteroides (allbac), and human-specific bacteroides (hf183), and genetic markers for the pathogens campylobacter jejuni, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, and shigella flexneri were monitored over the course of two weeks using conventional culture methods and quantitative pcr (qpcr). the effect of moisture on the persistence of culturable fib and all genetic markers was also determined. in addition, propidium monoazide (pma) treatment was used to examine  differences in the persistence of total genetic markers and those from live cells. decay rates were statistically compared using tukey's test. moisture had a significant (p </= 0.05) effect on the decay rates of culturable indicator bacteria, total allbac markers, and genetic markers for fib, salmonella, and mrsa from live cells. at 14% sand moisture, the decay rate of total markers was slower than that of live cells for all qpcr assays, but at 28% moisture, there was no difference in the decay rates of total and live markers for any assay. allbac and mrsa markers increased in sand at 28% moisture, probably indicating cellular growth. overall, culturable fib and hf183 had decay rates that were most comparable to the bacterial pathogen markers examined in this study, whereas entero1 and allbac rarely exhibited decay rates similar to the bacterial pathogens in this study. the choice of fib for assessment of fecal contamination  in freshwater sand should take into account the pathogen of concern and sand moisture conditions.

AB  == medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. bacterial pathogens (salmonella, escherichia coli, campylobacter, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. these new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified,  and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.

TI  == prevention of staphylococcus aureus infections by glycoprotein vaccines synthesized in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of superficial and invasive  human disease that is often refractory to antimicrobial therapy. vaccines have the potential to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic impact associated  with staphylococcal infections. however, single-component vaccines targeting s. aureus have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials. methods: a novel glycoengineering technology for creation of a multicomponent staphylococcal vaccine is described. genes encoding s. aureus capsular polysaccharide (cp) biosynthesis, pglb (a campylobacter oligosaccharyl transferase), and a protein carrier (detoxified pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein a or s. aureus alpha toxin  [hla]) were coexpressed in escherichia coli. recombinant proteins n-glycosylated  with s. aureus serotype 5 or 8 cps were purified from e. coli. results: rabbits and mice immunized with the glycoprotein vaccines produced antibodies that were active in vitro in functional assays. active and passive immunization strategies  targeting the cps protected mice against bacteremia, and vaccines targeting hla protected against lethal pneumonia. the cp-hla bioconjugate vaccine protected against both bacteremia and lethal pneumonia, providing broad-spectrum efficacy against staphylococcal invasive disease. conclusions: glycoengineering technology, whereby polysaccharide and protein antigens are enzymatically linked  in a simple e. coli production system, has broad applicability for use in vaccine development against encapsulated microbial pathogens.

TI  == geographic setting influences great lakes beach microbiological water quality.
AB  == understanding of factors that influence escherichia coli (ec) and enterococci (ent) concentrations, pathogen occurrence, and microbial sources at great lakes beaches comes largely from individual beach studies. using 12 representative beaches, we tested enrichment cultures from 273 beach water and 22 tributary samples for ec, ent, and genes indicating the bacterial pathogens shiga-toxin producing e. coli (stec), shigella spp. , salmonella spp , campylobacter jejuni/coli , and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , and 108-145 samples for bacteroides human, ruminant, and gull source-marker genes. ec/ent temporal patterns, general bacteroides concentration, and pathogen types and occurrence were regionally consistent (up to 40 km), but beach catchment variables (drains/creeks, impervious surface, urban land cover) influenced exceedances of ec/ent standards and detections of salmonella and stec. pathogen detections were more numerous when the ec/ent beach action value (but not when the geometric mean and statistical threshold value) was exceeded. ec, ent, and pathogens were not necessarily influenced by the same variables. multiple bacteroides sources, varying by date, occurred at every beach. study of multiple  beaches in different geographic settings provided new insights on the contrasting influences of regional and local variables, and a broader-scale perspective, on significance of ec/ent exceedances, bacterial sources, and pathogen occurrence.

TI  == isolation and characterization of antimicrobial constituents of searsia chirindensis l. (anacardiaceae) leaf extracts.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: searsia chirindensis is used in south african traditional medicine for management of bacterial infections such as diarrhoea. aim of the study was to examine the phytochemical composition from the leaves of  searsia chirindensis that is responsible for the ethnomedicinal use of this plant. materials and methods: the crude extract (80% methanol) was extracted sequentially with dichloromethane (dcm), ethyl acetate (etoac) and n-butanol. the extracts and isolated compounds were tested for their antibacterial activity against gram-negative (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) bacterial strains using the microdilution method. bioguided fractionation of etoac fraction afforded five phenolic compounds. structural elucidation was carried out using nmr (1d and 2d)  spectroscopic analyses. results: of the three fractions obtained from the crude extract, etoac was the most active and its fractionation afforded methyl gallate  (1), and four flavonol glycosides: myricetin-3-o-arabinopyranoside (2), myricetrin-3-o-rhamnoside (3), kaempferol-3-o-rhamnoside (4) and quercetin-3-o-arabinofuranoside (5). these compounds are reported from searsia chirindensis for the first time. all the compounds showed good antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains tested. their minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 30 to 250 microg/ml. conclusions: antibacterial activity demonstrated by the extracts and isolated compounds provides credence to the ethnomedicinal use of searsia chirindensis against diarrhoea.

TI  == [infectious etiology of acute idiopathic intussusception in children].
AB  == the intussusception (iia) is an invagination of the immediate part of the intestine. she is responsible for a syndrome with an occlusive venous compression and swelling that can rapidly progress to intestinal necrosis. most cases occur in children aged 6 to 18 months and occur more frequently in boys than girls. there are two types of iia: the iia idiopathic representing 90-95% of invaginations of the child and the iia secondary to local injury of the gastrointestinal tract or occurring in a particular context whose frequency are between 5 and 10%. the pathogenesis of the iia remains uncertain, but the infectious origin is criminalized in most idiopathic invaginations. this component is dominated by viral agents including adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus and epstein-barrvirus. bacterial agents are rather found and include yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157, h7, salmonella and campylobacter. in a small proportion parasitic agents may be reported in the iia, the most frequently found are entamoeba histolytica, trichuris trichuira, ascaris lumbricoides, ankylostoma and giardia.

TI  == dynamics of the cag-type iv secretion system of helicobacter pylori as studied by bacterial co-infections.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-negative bacteria possess type iv secretion systems (t4ss) to inject effector proteins directly into host cells to modulate cellular processes to their benefit. the human bacterial pathogen helicobacter pylori, a major aetiological agent in the development of chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer  and gastric carcinoma, harbours the cag-t4ss to inject the cytotoxin associated antigen (caga) into gastric epithelial cells. this results in deregulation of major signalling cascades, actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements and eventually gastric cancer. we show here that a pre-infection with live h. pylori has a dose-dependent negative effect on the caga translocation efficiency of a later infecting strain. this effect of the 'first' strain was independent of any of its t4ss, the vacuolating cytotoxin (vaca) or flagella. other bacterial pathogens, e.g. pathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, or commensal bacteria, such as lactobacilli, were unable to interfere with h. pylori's caga translocation capacity in the same way. this interference was independent of the beta1 integrin receptor availability for h. pylori, but certain h. pylori outer membrane proteins, such as hopi, hopq or alpab, were essential for the effect. we suggest that the specific interference mechanism induced by h. pylori represents a cellular response to restrict and control caga  translocation into a host cell to control the cellular damage.

TI  == pathogenic microbiological baseline survey of pork carcasses in taiwan.
AB  == from 2004 to 2010, pork carcass swabs from state-inspected slaughter plants in taiwan were intermittently analyzed to determine the prevalence of selected pathogenic microorganisms associated with foodborne illness. the prevalences of staphylococcus aureus each year from 2006 to 2010 were 6.6, 10.8, 5.1, 6.4, and 7.4%, respectively, while those of listeria monocytogenes were 1.2% in 2004, 1.3% in 2005, and 3.5% in 2008. the prevalences of clostridium perfringens were 0.9% in 2004, 3.2% in 2005, and 1.1% in 2008. campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli had a higher recovery rate than the other surveyed microorganisms, with prevalences during 2004, 2005, and 2008 of 21.1, 13.7, and 8.1%, respectively. salmonella strains were analyzed each year, and their prevalences ranged between  3.0 and 6.9%. derby, typhimurium, anatum, choleraesuis, and agona were the five serovars most frequently identified among the salmonella isolates. escherichia coli o157:h7 was not detected in 2004, 2005, or 2010. routine baseline surveying  of pork carcasses to determine the prevalence of selected pathogens of concern for food safety can provide valuable information regarding the effectiveness of the slaughtering procedures or the need for interventions.

TI  == dietary fatty acids and immune response to food-borne bacterial infections.
AB  == functional innate and acquired immune responses are required to protect the host  from pathogenic bacterial infections. modulation of host immune functions may have beneficial or deleterious effects on disease outcome. different types of dietary fatty acids have been shown to have variable effects on bacterial clearance and disease outcome through suppression or activation of immune responses. therefore, we have chosen to review research across experimental models and food sources on the effects of commonly consumed fatty acids on the most common food-borne pathogens, including salmonella sp., campylobacter sp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, shigella sp., listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. altogether, the compilation of literature suggests that no single fatty acid is an answer for protection from all food-borne pathogens, and  further research is necessary to determine the best approach to improve disease outcomes.

TI  == outbreaks associated to large open air festivals, including music festivals, 1980 to 2012.
AB  == in the minds of many, large scale open air festivals have become associated with  spring and summer, attracting many people, and in the case of music festivals, thousands of music fans. these festivals share the usual health risks associated  with large mass gatherings, including transmission of communicable diseases and risk of outbreaks. large scale open air festivals have however specific characteristics, including outdoor settings, on-site housing and food supply and  the generally young age of the participants. outbreaks at large scale open air festivals have been caused by cryptosporium parvum, campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, hepatitis a virus, influenza virus, measles virus, mumps virus and norovirus. faecal-oral and respiratory transmissions of pathogens result from non-compliance with hygiene rules, inadequate sanitation and insufficient vaccination coverage.  sexual transmission of infectious diseases may also occur and is likely to be underestimated and underreported. enhanced surveillance during and after festivals is essential. preventive measures such as immunisations of participants and advice on-site and via social networks should be considered to reduce outbreaks at these large scale open air festivals.

AB  == to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of campylobacter, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in food-producing animals and  retail raw meats in japan, raw meat samples as well as food-producing animal feces, cutaneous swabs, and nasal swabs collected from 2004 to 2006 were analyzed. isolation rates of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, salmonella, and s. aureus were 34.6% (363 of 1,050), 2.7% (28 of 1,050), and 32.8% (238 of 725), respectively. mrsa was isolated from 3% (9 of 300) of meat samples. no vre were isolated in this study. antibiotic resistance in c. coli was higher than that in c. jejuni. three c. jejuni isolates from a patient with diarrhea in a hospital of shizuoka prefecture and two chicken samples that exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin had identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, suggesting that ciprofloxacin-resistant c. jejuni could have been distributed in meat. s. aureus isolates showed the highest level of resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline. resistance to tetracycline in s. aureus isolates from beef was lower than that seen in isolates from chicken and pork (p < 0.01). this study revealed that the prevalence of mrsa and vre were low in food-producing animals and retail domestic meats in japan, although campylobacter isolates resistant to fluoroquinolone and erythromycin were detected. the occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens should be monitored continuously to improve the management of the risks associated with antimicrobial drug resistance transferred from food-producing animals to humans.

TI  == structural insights from random mutagenesis of campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb.
AB  == background: protein glycosylation is of fundamental importance in many biological systems. the discovery of n-glycosylation in bacteria and the functional expression of the n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enabled the production of engineered glycoproteins and the study of the underlying molecular mechanisms. a particularly promising application for  protein glycosylation in recombinant bacteria is the production of potent conjugate vaccines where polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria are covalently bound to immunogenic carrier proteins. results: in this study capsular polysaccharides of the clinically relevant pathogen staphylococcus aureus serotype 5 (cp5) were expressed in escherichia coli and linked in vivo to a detoxified version of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin (epa). we investigated which amino acids of the periplasmic domain of pglb are crucial for the glycosylation reaction using a newly established 96-well screening system enabling the relative quantification of glycoproteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. a random mutant library was generated by error-prone pcr and screened for inactivating amino acid substitutions. in addition to 15 inactive variants with amino acid changes within the previously known, strictly conserved  wwdyg motif of n-oligosaccharyltransferases, 8 inactivating mutations mapped to a flexible loop in close vicinity of the amide nitrogen atom of the acceptor asparagine as revealed in the crystal structure of the homologous enzyme c. lari  pglb. the importance of the conserved loop residue h479 for glycosylation was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis, while a change to alanine of the adjacent, non-conserved l480 had no effect. in addition, we investigated functional requirements in the so-called miv motif of bacterial n-oligosaccharyltransferases. amino acid residues i571 and v575, which had been postulated to interact with the acceptor peptide, were subjected to cassette saturation mutagenesis. with the exception of i571c only hydrophobic residues were found in active variants. variant i571v performed equally well as the wild type, cysteine at the same position reduced glycoprotein yield slightly, while a  change to phenylalanine reduced activity by a factor of three. conclusions: this  study provides novel structure-function relationships for the periplasmic domain  of the campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb and describes procedures for generating and screening oligosaccharyltransferase mutant libraries in an engineered e. coli system.

AB  == the results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of the non-spore-forming pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli (total count and o157:h7), listeria, campylobacter and salmonella, in new zealand's raw milk supply. samples of raw milk were collected monthly within five major dairying regions over one year. each month, samples from five randomly selected farm vats in each region were collected for analysis (297 samples in total). methods based on plate count  techniques were used to enumerate s. aureus and e. coli. enrichment methods in combination with a modified most probable number detection method were used to monitor samples for the presence of e. coli o157:h7, listeria, campylobacter and  salmonella. salmonella was not detected in this study, and campylobacter was isolated once (0.34%). e. coli was present at <100 cfu/ml in 99% of samples and exceeded 10(3)cfu/ml in 0.7% of samples. e. coli o157:h7 was not detected whereas non-pathogenic e. coli o157 strains (i.e. lacking genes for stx1, stx2, eae and hly a) were detected in 1% of samples. s. aureus was not detected (<1 cfu/ml) in  21% of samples; levels were >1 but <100 cfu/ml in 60% of samples and on one occasion (0.34%) s. aureus exceeded 10(4)cfu/ml. l. monocytogenes was isolated from 0.68% of samples and l. innocua was present in 4% of samples. the results demonstrate that raw milk sampled from farm vats in new zealand, as in other countries, inevitably contains recognised pathogens and, hence, control by pasteurisation or an equivalent treatment of raw milk remains paramount. even so, the prevalence of most of these pathogens was lower than those reported in many of the studies performed in other countries.

AB  == this report documents the presence of fecal indicators and bacterial pathogens in sand at 53 california marine beaches using both culture-dependent and -independent (pcr and quantitative pcr [qpcr]) methods. fecal indicator bacteria  were widespread in california beach sand, with escherichia coli and enterococci detected at 68% and 94% of the beaches surveyed, respectively. somatic coliphages and a bacteroidales human-specific fecal marker were detected at 43% and 13% of the beaches, respectively. dry sand samples from almost 30% of the beaches contained at least one of the following pathogens: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), which were detected at 15%, 13%, 14%, and 3% of tested beaches, respectively. fecal indicators and pathogens were poorly correlated to one another and to land cover. sands were dry at the time of collection, and those with relatively high moisture tended to have higher concentrations or a more frequent occurrence of both indicators and pathogens. using culture-dependent assays, fecal indicators decayed faster than pathogens in microcosm experiments using unaltered beach sand seeded with sewage and assessed by culture-dependent assays. the following order of persistence was observed (listed from most to least persistent): campylobacter > salmonella > somatic coliphages > enterococci  > e. coli > f(+) phages. in contrast, pathogens decayed faster than fecal indicators in culture-independent assays: enterococci > bacteroidales human-specific marker > salmonella > campylobacter. microcosm experiments demonstrated that both indicators and pathogens were mobilized by wetting with seawater. decay rates measured by qpcr were lower than those measured with culture-dependent methods. enterococcal persistence and possible growth were observed for wetted microcosms relative to unwetted controls.

AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == microbial challenges of poultry meat production.
AB  == food safety and shelf-life are both important microbial concerns in relation to broiler meat production. focus is mainly placed on the absence or control of potentially pathogenic microbes such as salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. but, from the commercial point of view, other spoilage bacteria also play a role  as potential threats. regarding food safety, the primary target should be the production of pathogen-free live animals, thus allowing slaughter plants to keep  the processing line free of those microorganisms. consumers believe that quality  of foods from organic production is superior to foods from conventional production. the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the bacterial quality of chicken meat from organic and conventional production on the basis of traditional meat quality criteria. fresh free grazing broiler carcasses  were purchased directly from rural households (n = 80) and fresh retail chicken parts from conventional broiler carcasses from the local supermarkets in the region of epirus (poultry producers association. arta) (n = 200). the samples were microbiologically tested for the presence of bacteria such as: salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., and c. perfringens. total count of aerobic  mesophilic bacteria was also determined. bacteriological tests were performed by  means of standard methods of isolation and identification of individual species of bacteria according to iso requirements. api-tests (biomerieux) and vitek 2 identification system (biomerieux) were used for biochemical determination. high  levels of microbial contamination and occurrence of pathogenic bacteria at then fresh free grazing broiler carcasses reflect the poor hygienic quality of the slaughter conditions in the rural households.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in hawaiian coastal streams--associations with fecal indicators, land cover, and water quality.
AB  == this work aimed to understand the distribution of five bacterial pathogens in o'ahu coastal streams and relate their presence to microbial indicator concentrations, land cover of the surrounding watersheds, and physical-chemical measures of stream water quality. twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in  december and march, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. salmonella, campylobacter, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio vulnificus, and v. parahaemolyticus were widespread -12 of 22 o'ahu streams had all five pathogens. all stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four  fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean +/- standard deviation densities  of 2.2 +/- 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 +/- 0.7 escherichia coli, 1.1 +/- 0.7 clostridium perfringens, 1.2 +/- 0.8 f(+) coliphages, and 3.6 +/- 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive  to sunlight. multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical-chemical water quality showed positive associations between salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between s. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical-chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterborne illness related to o'ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of major foodborne pathogens from major meat products.
AB  == the bacterial contamination of raw and processed meat products with resistant pathogens was studied. the raw samples included sheep (40), goat (40), pork (120), beef (80), and chicken (19) meat, and the processed samples included turkey filets (33), salami (8), readymade mincemeat (16), stuffing (22), and roast-beef (50). the samples were collected from retail shops in northwestern greece over a period of 3 years. the isolated pathogens were evaluated for susceptibilities to 19 antimicrobial agents used in humans. out of 428 samples, 157 strains of escherichia coli, 25 of yersinia enterocolitica, 57 of staphylococcus aureus, 57 of enterococcus spp., 4 of salmonella spp., and 3 of campylobacter jejuni were isolated. among the isolates 14.6% of the e. coli, 10.5% of s. aureus, 4% of y. enterocolitica, 25% of salmonella spp., and 42.1% of enterococcus spp. were susceptible to antibiotics. e. coli from chicken exhibited high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (62.5%) followed by lamb/goat (10.9%),  pork (15.7%), and beef (27.9%) meat. resistance to nitrofurantoin dominated in the lamb/goat isolates (60%). resistance to tetracycline predominated in pork (68.2%) and chicken (62.5%), and resistance to aminoglycosides dominated in lamb/goat meat isolates. s. aureus resistance to clindamycin predominated in lamb/goat isolates (50%), whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin predominated in the pork strains, but no resistance to methicillin was observed. of the enterococci isolates 21.1% were resistant to vancomycin. high resistance to ampicillin (96%)  was observed in y. enterocolitica and all of the c. jejuni isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefuroxime. these results indicate that meat can be a source of resistant bacteria, which could potentially be spread to  the community through the food chain.

TI  == [viable non-culturable bacteria].
AB  == viable but non-culturable cells (vbnc) are defined as live bacteria, but which do not either grow or divide. such bacteria cannot be cultivated on conventional media (they do not form colonies on solid media, they do not change broth appearance), but their existence can be proved using other methods. the switch to the vbnc stage has been described and documented for several bacterial species: vibrio spp. (cholerae, vulnificus and other species), escherichia coli (including ehec), campylobacter jejuni, helicobacter pylori, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolytica, shigella spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., cronobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, providencia spp., morganella spp., pseudomonas spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, enterococcus spp.  the capacity of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to enter the vbnc stage started to concern microbiologists in the field of food industry (food and  water safety) and pharmaceutical industry. many studies have shown that processes meant to achieve bactericidal effects can favour bacterial switch to vbnc. viable but non-culturable stage is reversible. concerns are due to the capacity of vbnc, especially of potentially pathogen cells, to switch to the infectious stage once  in the host organism.

TI  == performance of food safety management systems in poultry meat preparation processing plants in relation to campylobacter spp. contamination.
AB  == a diagnostic instrument comprising a combined assessment of core control and assurance activities and a microbial assessment instrument were used to measure the performance of current food safety management systems (fsmss) of two poultry  meat preparation companies. the high risk status of the company's contextual factors, i.e., starting from raw materials (poultry carcasses) with possible high numbers and prevalence of pathogens such as campylobacter spp., requires advanced core control and assurance activities in the fsms to guarantee food safety. the level of the core fsms activities differed between the companies, and this difference was reflected in overall microbial quality (mesophilic aerobic count), presence of hygiene indicators (enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli), and contamination with pathogens such as salmonella, listeria  monocytogenes, and campylobacter spp. the food safety output expressed as a microbial safety profile was related to the variability in the prevalence and contamination levels of campylobacter spp. in poultry meat preparations found in  a belgian nationwide study. although a poultry meat processing company could have an advanced fsms in place and a good microbial profile (i.e., lower prevalence of pathogens, lower microbial numbers, and less variability in microbial contamination), these positive factors might not guarantee pathogen-free products. contamination could be attributed to the inability to apply effective interventions to reduce or eliminate pathogens in the production chain of (raw) poultry meat preparations.

TI  == a qualitative risk assessment approach for swiss dairy products: opportunities and limitations.
AB  == switzerland implemented a risk-based monitoring of swiss dairy products in 2002 based on a risk assessment (ra) that considered the probability of exceeding a microbiological limit value set by law. a new ra was launched in 2007 to review and further develop the previous assessment, and to make recommendations for future risk-based monitoring according to current risks. the resulting qualitative ra was designed to ascertain the risk to human health from the consumption of swiss dairy products. the products and microbial hazards to be considered in the ra were determined based on a risk profile. the hazards included campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin. the release assessment considered the prevalence of the hazards in bulk milk samples, the influence of the process parameters on the microorganisms, and the influence of the type of dairy. the exposure assessment was linked to the production volume. an overall probability was estimated combining the probabilities of release and exposure for each combination of hazard, dairy product and type of dairy. this overall probability  represents the likelihood of a product from a certain type of dairy exceeding the microbiological limit value and being passed on to the consumer. the consequences could not be fully assessed due to lack of detailed information on the number of  disease cases caused by the consumption of dairy products. the results were expressed as a ranking of overall probabilities. finally, recommendations for the design of the risk-based monitoring programme and for filling the identified data gaps were given. the aims of this work were (i) to present the qualitative ra approach for swiss dairy products, which could be adapted to other settings and (ii) to discuss the opportunities and limitations of the qualitative method.

TI  == evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of  a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. we tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella infantis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. the disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative mic determination with dilution methods. a comparison of the results for mic obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. the microdilution method with ttc (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or int (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only atp determination was appropriate for microaerophilic campylobacter spp. using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the mic values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. we suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for mic determination and the macrodilution method at selected mic values to confirm bacterial inactivation. campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but s. infantis and e. coli o157:h7 were more resistant.

TI  == development of a dna microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the national center for biotechnology information database.
AB  == to understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (ar), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. to achieve this, ar genes in the national center for biotechnology information genbank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. a dna microarray was constructed of 70mer  oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. the microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of salmonella enterica: typhimurium lt2 (sensitive) and typhi ct18 (multidrug resistance [mdr]). all resistance genes encoded on the mdr  plasmid, phcm1, harbored by ct18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in lt2. the microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including mdr salmonella enterica serovars, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and clostridium difficile. the results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all ar genes found in the national center for biotechnology information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  == multiplexed bead-based mesofluidic system for detection of food-borne pathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == in the present study, a simple and rapid multiplexed bead-based mesofluidic system (bms) was developed for simultaneous detection of food-borne pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, vibrio parahaemolyticus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacter sakazakii, shigella, escherichia coli o157:h7, and campylobacter jejuni. this system is based on utilization of isothiocyanate-modified microbeads that are 250 mum in diameter, which were immobilized with specific amino-modified oligonucleotide probes and placed in polydimethylsiloxane microchannels. pcr products from the pathogens studied were  pumped into microchannels to hybridize with the oligonucleotide-modified beads, and hybridization signals were detected using a conventional microarray scanner.  the short sequences of nucleic acids (21 bases) and pcr products characteristic of bacterial pathogens could be detected at concentrations of 1 pm and 10 nm, respectively. the detection procedure could be performed in less than 30 min with high sensitivity and specificity. the assay was simple and fast, and the limits of quantification were in the range from 500 to 6,000 cfu/ml for the bacterial species studied. the feasibility of identification of food-borne bacteria was investigated with samples contaminated with bacteria, including milk, egg, and meat samples. the results demonstrated that the bms method can be used for effective detection of multiple pathogens in different foodstuffs.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == divercin v41 from gene characterization to food applications: 1998-2008, a decade of solved and unsolved questions.
AB  == the emergence of an increasing number of antibiotic resistant human clinical bacteria has been a great cause of concern for the last decades. as an example, staphylococcus aureus isolates in the hospital environment are becoming more and  more resistant to antibiotics including vancomycin which is considered as a last  line of defence in treatment of staphylococcus aureus-resistant methicillin. on the other hand, food safety is threatened by development of pathogenic bacteria including listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus. the use of antimicrobial peptides such as glycopeptides, semi-synthetic peptides, bacteriocins including lantibiotics offers a hope to face these clinical and food microbiology concerns. clinical approval of new chemotherapeutic agents requires a long period of time.  research on bacteriocins has demonstrated potential use to fight against undesired foodborne pathogens but the use industrial use of bacteriocins is limited. to date only lantibiotic nisin and in class iia bacteriocin pediocin pa-1 are legally used as food preservative in many countries. the present minireview is focused on divercin v41 (dvnv41), a class iia bacteriocin naturally produced by carnobacterium divergens v41. the last decade has been the witness of intensive investigations carried out on this cationic peptide tempting to answer  multiple questions covering basic and applied aspects. dvnv41 has shown a wide spectrum of activity either alone or in combination with nisin and/or polymixins  (synergistic effect). this outcome indicates that cb. divergens v41 could potentially be used for safe and efficient prevention of l. monocytogenes growth  in cold smoked salmon.

TI  == effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  == pathogenic microorganisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. these bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. pulsed electric field (pef) is  a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food.  the pef treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as listeria innocua, e.  coli, salmonella typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli 8739 at pasteurization  levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. however, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by pef processing is very limited. therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.

AB  == in an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the republic  of korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic escherichia coli, especially, eaec was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by staphylococcus aureus, salmonella species, bacillus cereus, vibrio parahaemolyticus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, and shigella species. distinct seasonality was found in v. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed  no age-specific patterns. however, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic e. coli, s. aureus, salmonella spp., and b. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the  year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic e. coli, salmonella spp., and s. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. however, both pathogenic e.  coli and salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. moreover, s. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. in  conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.

TI  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an excel-based software program, risk ranger. it is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. risk scores provided by the tool were  characterized as low, medium and high. also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. low risk scores were obtained for salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) for low risk population. high risk scores were obtained for hepatitis e virus (hev) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). moderate risk scores for salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). scores for staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for s. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. high risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes (high risk population), ehec (high risk population) or s. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and hev (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. only salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes and e. coli ehec gave moderate risk ratings in  case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. these results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a  food safety management system.

TI  == microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of food prepared and served in rural households of lungwena, malawi.
AB  == the presence of food-borne pathogens, escherichia coli 0157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella species, campylobacter jejuni and non-pathogenic e. coli, in 132 home cooked food samples consisting of maize flour porridge (mfp), (n=41), fish (n=37), vegetables (n=28), beans (n=13) and "others" (n=13), collected from  6 villages in lungwena, malawi was investigated. it was found that 35% of the food samples were contaminated with one or more pathogens; with 48%, 8%, 61% and  23% of the food samples being found to harbour e. coli, pathogenic e. coli 0157:  h7, s aureus and salmonella species, respectively. c. jejuni was not detected in  any food sample. using a 95% level of significance, pathogen concentration among  food categories demonstrated a statistical difference (p=0.001). distribution of  pathogens among villages was also found to be significant (p=0.03). mfp was the most contaminated food. practices that promote the spread of the pathogens in the rural household kitchens were investigated. food was thought to be contaminated as a result of poor food handling, preparation and storage practices.

TI  == shedding of food-borne pathogens and microbiological carcass contamination in rabbits at slaughter.
AB  == to obtain microbiological data from rabbits at slaughter, 500 fecal samples and 500 carcasses samples were examined. all samples tested negative for listeria and salmonella. campylobacter were detected in two fecal samples. of the 500 fecal samples, 45.8% tested positive for eae (intimin), 1.2% for stx (shiga toxin), and 1.8% for both eae and stx. by colony hybridization, 56 eae positive escherichia coli strains were isolated. among them, 27 strains (48.2%) were of the serotypes  o178:h7 and o153:h7, whereas 15 strains (26.8%) belonged to a serogroup that has  not yet been described (o(cb10681):h7). all strains possessed intimin beta1 and the translocated intimin receptor (tir) capable of being tyrosine phosphorylated. none of the strains harbored the genes for shiga toxins, east1 (asta), bundlin (bfpa), or the eaf plasmid. slaughter rabbits therefore constitute a reservoir for certain atypical enteropathogenic escherichia coli. on rabbit carcasses, average total bacterial counts accounted for 3.3 log cfu cm(-2). enterobacteriaceae and coagulase positive staphylococci (cps) were detected on 118 (23.6%) and 153 (30.6%) carcasses, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and cps counts of positive samples were mainly <1.5 log cfu cm(-2). among 153 selected cps isolates, 98.7% were identified as staphylococcus aureus. none of the 151 isolated strains harbored the gene for methicillin resistance (meca). genes for staphylococcal enterotoxins (se) were detected in 102 strains. the combinations of seg and sei (53 strains) and sed, seg, sei, and sej (27 strains) dominated.

TI  == comparison of agar dilution and e-test for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of campylobacter coil isolates recovered from 80 ontario swine farms.
AB  == the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the level of agreement of the e-test for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing of campylobacter coli using the agar dilution technique, which is the approved method. a convenience sample of 80 ontario swine farms was chosen for this study; each farm was visited from january to june 2004. a total of 233 isolates of c. coli were tested for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials by agar dilution and the e-test. performance  of the tests was evaluated using 7 quality control strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, campylobacter jejuni atcc 33560, and campylobacter coli atcc 33559 for the e-test and e. coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, and c. jejuni atcc 33560 for the agar dilution test. weighted cohen's kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (pabak) tests  were used for statistical analysis. the e-test and agar dilution test results had a strong agreement when resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline were evaluated (weighted kappa: 0.68 and 0.66, respectively). however, marked disagreement was detected when testing susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ampicillin (0.15 and 0.22, respectively). almost perfect agreement was detected by pabak when testing susceptibility to gentamicin (0.99). agreement was found to be moderate for ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. although the level of agreement between the e-test and agar dilution depended on the antimicrobial being tested, the e-test always detected a lower proportion of resistant isolates compared to agar dilution.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == evidence of lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacterial pathogens exposed to high-intensity pulsed-plasma gas discharges.
AB  == aims: to apply scanning electron microscopy, image analysis and a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacteria exposed to pulsed-plasma gas discharges (ppgd). methods and results: the fluorescent redox probe 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) was used for enumerating actively respiring cells of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium that were suspended in sterile water at 4 degrees c and exposed to separate ppgd and heat treatments. while there was good agreement between use of respiratory staining (rs) and direct-selective agar plate counting (pc) for enumerating untreated bacteria, there were c. 1 and 3 log-unit differences in surviving cell numbers per millilitre for test organisms subjected to ppgd and heat treatments respectively, when enumerated by these different viability indicators. ppgd-treated bacteria were markedly altered at the cellular level when examined by scanning electron microscopy. conclusions: use of this rs  method revealed that substantial subpopulations of test bacteria rendered incapable of forming colonies by separate ppgd and heat treatments may remain metabolically active. significance and impact of the study: use of this rs method offers interesting perspectives on assessing established and novel microbial inactivation methods, and may also provide a better understanding of mechanisms involved in microbial inactivation induced by high-intensity ppgd treatments.

TI  == a systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  == objectives: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. data sources: studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians  involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the  conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. review methods: a systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid  diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. specific organisms under review were salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus. data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. a decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical uk population. finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of gps, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid  tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. results: good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays. the estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. the significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. conclusions: despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that pcr  for campylobacter, salmonella and e. coli o157 is potentially very successful in  identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. less is known about the benefits of testing for b. cereus, c. perfringens and s. aureus. further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.

TI  == microbiological safety of retail vacuum-packed and modified-atmosphere-packed cooked meats at end of shelf life.
AB  == a study of retail modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed cooked ready-to-eat meats was undertaken from september through mid-november 2003 to determine the microbiological quality at the end of shelf life and to establish any risk factors in the production, storage, and display of this product. examination of 2,981 samples using microbiological guidelines criteria revealed that 66% were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33% were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high aerobic colony counts and enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1% were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of listeria monocytogenes at 100 cfu/g or higher (27 samples; range of 10(2) to 106 cfu/g) and campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. all samples at the end of the shelf life had satisfactory (<20 cfu/g) and/or acceptable (<102 cfu/g) levels of staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens, four samples (<1%) had unsatisfactory levels of escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 cfu/g) and 5.5% of the samples contained l. monocytogenes at <20 cfu/g (4.8%) or between 20 and 100 cfu/g (0.7%). more samples of chicken (45%; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43%; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41%; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham  (23%; 317 of 1,351 samples) or pork (32%; 67 of 206 samples). twelve different l. monocytogenes typing characters (serotype-amplified fragment length polymorphism  type-phage type) were evaluated for isolates recovered from samples of unacceptable quality, and the 1/2-ix-nt type was recovered from almost half (48%) of these samples. salmonella was not detected in any samples examined. risk factors identified for cooked meats that were microbiologically contaminated more frequently included vacuum packaging, packaging on retail premises, slicing, temperature not monitored in display units, and no hazard analysis system in place. results from this study also suggest that the shelf life assigned to some  modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed meats may not be appropriate.

TI  == microbiological characterization of imported and domestic boneless beef trim used for ground beef.
AB  == the united states imports lean boneless beef trim from australia (aus), new zealand (nzl), and uruguay (ury) to meet demand for ground beef production. the reported incidence of and etiological agents responsible for foodborne diseases differ between these countries and the united states. our objective was to determine whether current u.s. microbiological profiling adequately addresses the potential differences between foreign and domestic beef trim. we compared the hygienic status of imported and domestic (usa) beef trim by enumeration of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. we also compared the prevalence of pathogens between imported and domestic samples by screening for the presence of salmonella, campylobacter spp., listeria spp., and non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec). a total of 1,186 samples (487 usa, 220 aus, 223 nzl, and 256 ury) of boneless beef trim were analyzed. results of enumeration revealed significant differences between samples from all countries, with the lowest pathogen numbers  in samples from aus and the highest in samples from ury. six salmonella isolates  (1 nzl, 1 ury, and 4 usa), 79 l. monocytogenes isolates (4 aus, 5 nzl, 53 ury, and 17 usa), and 7 campylobacter isolates (1 nzl, 1 ury, 5 usa) were found among  the trim samples tested. non-o157 stec prevalence was 10% in nzl samples and about 30% in all of the other samples; 99 stec strains were isolated. serotyping  of these isolates revealed that serotypes associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome were not different in prevalence between imported and domestic beef trim. although it may be tempting to do so, these data cannot be used to compare  the microbiological quality of beef trim between the countries examined. however, these results indicate that the current pathogen monitoring procedures in the united states are adequate for evaluation of imported beef trim.

TI  == electrochemical detection of harmful algae and other microbial contaminants in coastal waters using hand-held biosensors.
AB  == standard methods to identify microbial contaminants in the environment are slow,  laborious, and can require specialized expertise. this study investigated electrochemical detection of microbial contaminants using commercially available, hand-held instruments. electrochemical assays were developed for a red tide dinoflagellate (karenia brevis), fecal-indicating bacteria (enterococcus spp.), markers indicative of human sources of fecal pollution (human cluster bacteroides and the esp gene of enterococcus faecium), bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli  0157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus), and a viral pathogen (adenovirus). for k. brevis, two assay formats (rapid pcr-detect and hybrid pcr-detect) were tested and both provided detection limits of 10 genome equivalents for dna isolated from k. brevis culture and amplified by pcr.  sensitivity with coastal water samples was sufficient to detect k. brevis that was "present" (<or=1000 cells/l) without yielding false positive results and the  electrochemical signal was significantly different than for samples containing cells at "medium" concentrations (100,000 to<10(6)cells/l). detection of k. brevis rna was also shown. multi-target capability was demonstrated with an 8-plex assay for bacterial and viral targets using isolated dna, natural beach water spiked with human feces, and water and sediments collected from new orleans, louisiana following hurricane katrina. furthermore, direct detection of  dinoflagellate and bacterial dna was achieved using lysed cells rather than extracted nucleic acids, allowing streamlining of the process. the methods presented can be used to rapidly (3-5h) screen environmental water samples for the presence of microbial contaminants and have the potential to be integrated into semi-automated detection platforms.

TI  == susceptibility of bacteria isolated from pigs to tiamulin and enrofloxacin metabolites.
AB  == susceptibilities to metabolites of tiamulin (tia) and enrofloxacin (enr) were tested using selected bacteria with previously defined minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic). the tia metabolites tested were: n-deethyl-tiamulin (dtia), 2beta-hydroxy-tiamulin (2beta-htia) and 8alpha-hydroxy-tiamulin (8alpha-htia), and the enr metabolites were: ciprofloxacin (cip) and enrofloxacin n-oxide (enr-n). bacteria, all of porcine origin, were selected as representatives of bacterial infections (staphylococcus hyicus and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae), zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli) and indicator bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococci). furthermore the effects of these compounds were tested on the microbial community of active sludge to test any negative effect on colony forming units (cfu). dtia had a potency of 12.5-50% of the potency of tia. 2beta-htia and 8alpha-htia had potencies less than 1% of the potency of tia. enr-n had a potency of 0.75-1.5% of the potency of enr, while cip and enr had similar potencies. results obtained here indicate that cip and dtia could contribute to the selective pressure for upholding antimicrobial resistant bacteria in animals under enr or tia treatment. the most potent metabolites cip and dtia showed considerable potencies against activated sludge bacteria compared to the parent compounds. ec(50) (microg/ml) for enr, cip, tia and dtia were 0.018 [95% ci: 0.028-0.149], 0.064 [95% ci: 0.007-0.046], 6.0 [95% ci: 3.6-9.8], and 9.7 [95% ci: 5.8-16.3], respectively. this indicates that the compounds can change the bacterial population in the sludge, and hereby alter the properties of the sludge.

TI  == the effect of lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils and their components on the survival of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in food systems.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (citrus limon), sweet orange (citrus sinensis) and bergamot (citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. methods and results: the disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli  o157 and campylobacter jejuni. the survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. the results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil  (eo) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (p > 0.001). citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in l. monocytogenes, staph. aureus and b. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in l. monocytogenes and b. cereus populations, had no effect on staph. aureus. conclusions: bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although camp. jejuni and e. coli o157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. all bacteria tested were less  susceptible in food systems than in vitro. of the gram-positive bacteria tested staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. significance and impact of the study: results suggest the possibility that citrus eos, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily.
AB  == drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.  they can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging  antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. the design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. we describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the 'major facilitator superfamily' (mfs) of transport proteins from helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, brucella melitensis, campylobacter jejuni, neisseria meningitides and streptomyces coelicolor. the h. pylori putative drug resistance protein, hp1092,  and the s. aureus qaca proteins are used as detailed examples. this strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination.

TI  == berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. the most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were helicobacter pylori and bacillus cereus. campylobacter jejuni and candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. however, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined salmonella strains as indicated by 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn) uptake  increase and analysis of liberation of [14c]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested salmonella strains, and significant increase in the npn uptake was recorded. the stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using escherichia coli and nonvirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. the amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.

TI  == [symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in kyushu, japan].
AB  == in this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: norovirus, salmonella, vibrio parahaemolyticus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec), shigella sonnei/flexneri (shigella), staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type bacillus cereus. the symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of kyushu between january 2000 and december 2004 were recorded. the pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was b. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by s. aureus (3.3 h), c. perfringens (10.7 h) and v. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). all the patients infected  with b. cereus and s. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with v. parahaemolyticus and c. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. bloody diarrhea was associated with stec and shigella, but rare with other pathogens. vomiting was associated with almost all cases of s. aureus and b. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the norovirus cases and 56.1% of the v. parahaemolyticus cases. vomiting was less common in the c. perfringens (22.0%) and the etec and stec (both about 5%). bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with stec 0157 infection than with stec non-0157 infection. since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.

TI  == a survey of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary referral hospital in the united arab emirates.
AB  == published data on antimicrobial resistance are lacking for the united arab emirates (uae). knowledge of local patterns of resistance is essential to optimize guidelines for empirical antimicrobial treatment. awareness of susceptibility patterns in other parts of the world may be important for determining empirical antimicrobial therapy for travelers or patients transferred from abroad. antibiograms from unique isolates of common hospital and community bacteria are described in a tertiary referral hospital in the uae, which had no antimicrobial restrictions and limited resources. antimicrobial resistance rates  were unpredictable and were high for gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, shigella sonnei, campylobacter spp, and also streptococcus pneumoniae. in contrast, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) comprised less than  5% of s. aureus isolates and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) were not detected during the surveillance period. our results provide data on antimicrobial resistance for the uae and highlight the need for resources for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  == the coordination of food sampling activities across wales, a part of the united kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. this surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. the food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. for all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for escherichia coli, and 0.5% for listeria spp. overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. no campylobacter-positive samples and  only one salmonella-positive sample were found. the analysis of the results show  that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current united kingdom guidelines. the information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.

TI  == active membrane transport and receptor proteins from bacteria.
AB  == a general strategy for the expression of bacterial membrane transport and receptor genes in escherichia coli is described. expression is amplified so that  the encoded proteins comprise 5-35% of e. coli inner membrane protein. depending  upon their topology, proteins are produced with rgsh6 or a strep tag at the c-terminus. these enable purification in mg quantities for crystallization and nmr studies. examples of one nutrient uptake and one multidrug extrusion protein  from helicobacter pylori are described. this strategy is successful for membrane  proteins from h. pylori, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, microbacterium liquefaciens, brucella abortus, brucella melitensis, campylobacter jejuni, neisseria meningitides, streptomyces coelicolor and rhodobacter sphaeroides.

TI  == microbicidal activity of tripotassium phosphate and fatty acids toward spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.
AB  == the ability of solutions of tripotassium phosphate (tpp) and fatty acids (lauric  and myristic acids) to reduce populations of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms associated with processed poultry was examined. in vitro studies were conducted with cultures of bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) and yeasts (candida ernobii and yarrowia lipolytica). cultures of the bacteria and yeasts were suspended in solutions of tpp or mixtures of tpp with lauric or myristic acid and mixed for 5 min. viable numbers  (log cfu per milliliter) in the suspensions were enumerated on microbiological agar. results indicated that tpp solutions are highly bactericidal toward gram-negative bacteria and that mixtures of tpp and fatty acids are highly microbicidal toward gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts. the microbicidal activity of mixtures of tpp and fatty acids toward the native bacterial flora of skin of processed broiler carcasses was also examined. skin samples were washed in mixtures of tpp and fatty acid, and the populations of total aerobic bacteria, campylobacters, enterococci, e. coli, lactic acid bacteria, pseudomonads, staphylococci, and yeasts in the skin rinsates were enumerated on the appropriate microbiological media. results indicated that washing the skin in mixtures of tpp and fatty acids produced significant reductions in the number of aerobic bacteria, campylobacters, e. coli, pseudomonads, and yeasts recovered from skin rinsates, but there was no significant reduction in the populations of enterococci, lactic acid bacteria, or staphylococci. these findings indicate that mixtures of tpp and fatty acids possess microbicidal activity against several microorganisms associated with processed poultry and that these solutions could be useful as microbicides to reduce the populations of some bacteria and yeasts associated with some poultry processing operations.

TI  == food safety knowledge of consumers and the microbiological and temperature status of their refrigerators.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to examine domestic food safety knowledge levels of consumers, establish the levels and incidence of bacterial contamination and operational temperatures in domestic refrigerators, and identify areas in which consumer food safety education is necessary in ireland. a food safety knowledge questionnaire applied to a representative sample of households (n = 1,020) throughout the island of ireland found the gaps in consumer food safety knowledge. analysis of swab samples (n = 900) recovered from the domestic refrigerators in these households showed average total viable counts of 7.1 log cfu/cm2 and average total coliform counts of 4.0 log cfu/cm2. analysis of swab samples also detected the incidence of staphylococcus aureus (41%), escherichia coli (6%), salmonella enterica (7%), listeria monocytogenes (6%), and yersinia enterocolitica (2%). campylobacter jejuni and e. coli o157:h7 were not detected in domestic refrigerators. the temperature profiles of a subset of the sampled refrigerators (100) were monitored for 72 h, and 59% were found to operate, on average, at temperatures above the recommended 5 degrees c. knowledge and temperature survey results varied considerably, but consumers who scored better in terms of basic food safety knowledge had reduced levels of bacterial contamination in their refrigerators and reported a reduced incidence of food-associated illnesses. this study confirms the effect of basic food hygiene knowledge on hygienic practice and identifies specific areasfor emphasis in the development and delivery of effective food safety risk communication messages to  consumers.

TI  == extracellular secretion of polypeptides using a modified escherichia coli flagellar secretion apparatus.
AB  == we developed a modified flagellar type iii secretion apparatus to secrete heterologous polypeptides into the growth medium of escherichia coli. the secretion was facilitated by fusing the 173-bp untranslated dna fragment upstream of the gene flic (encoding flagellin) as well as a transcriptional terminator from flic, into the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest. the polypeptides secreted into the growth medium at concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg/l were  from campylobacter jejuni (262 residues in length), streptococcus pneumoniae (434 residues), staphylococcus aureus (115 residues), and n-terminal flic hybrid proteins, for example, the eukaryotic green fluorescent protein (238 residues). the expressed proteins represented >50% of total secreted protein. previously reported protein yields from extracellular secretion of foreign proteins in e. coli have been low, approximately 100 microg/l. the strengths of our method are the concentration and purity of the secreted proteins and its versatility with regard to the proteins' length and origin.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == immobilized enzyme-linked dna-hybridization assay with electrochemical detection  for cryptosporidium parvum hsp70 mrna.
AB  == an electrochemical enzyme-linked immobilized dna-hybridization assay for the detection of cryptosporidium parvum in water has been developed. the target molecule was a 121-nucleotide sequence from the c. parvum heat shock protein 70 (hsp70 mrna from u71181 gene). this analyte offers the possibility of distinguishing dead from live oocysts. the assay involves covalent attachment of  a primary dna probe via its 5'-amine-terminus to self-assembled monolayers of mercaptoundecanoic acid to a gold surface. the primary dna probe was used to capture the target (sequence 1039-1082 of u71181 gene for the mrna), by hybridization to a 20-base complementary sequence on the target (at sequence 1063-1082). a secondary dna probe labeled with alkaline phosphatase (ap) was then hybridized to base sequence 1039-1062 on the target. p-aminophenol, which is enzymatically generated by the immobilized ap from p-aminophenyl phosphate (papp), is detected using electrochemistry. the peak current of cyclic voltammograms from a papp solution, in which gold-coated silicon wafer modified with the complete assembly of the assay components was incubated, is linear with  concentration of the target (5-50 microg/ml, where p1 and p2-ap concentrations are 50 microg/ml). a detection limit of 2 microg/ml (or 146 nm) of the dna target was obtained. cross-reactivity tests showed high selectivity for heat-shocked c.  parvum. no signal was obtained for either the synthetic dna for hsp70 of campylobacter lari, escherichia coli, giardia lamblia, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes or for the products of heat-shocked whole organisms of e. coli, g. lamblia, staphylococcus aureus, and cryptosporidium muris.

AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == the emulsiv filter removes microbial contamination from propofol but is not a substitute for aseptic technique.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the ability of the emulsiv filter (ef) to remove extrinsic microbial contaminants from propofol. methods: aliquots of staphylococcus aureus  (s. aureus), candida albicans (c. albicans), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae), moraxella osloensis (m. osloensis), enterobacter agglomerans (e. agglomerans), escherichia coli (e. coli), serratia marcescens (s. marcescens), moraxella catarrhalis (m. catarrhalis), haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) and campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni) were inoculated into vials containing 20 ml  of sterile propofol. the unfiltered inoculated propofol solutions served as controls. ten millilitres and 20 ml samples of the inoculated propofol were filtered through the ef. all solutions were then subplated onto three culture plates using a precision 1 micro l calibrated platinum loop and incubated. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were counted. data were analyzed using a one-sample t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. results: the ef was able to completely remove cfu of s. aureus, c. albicans, k. pneumoniae, m. osloensis, e. agglomerans, e. coli, s. marcescens, and m. catarrhalis (p < 0.05). a small number of h. influenzae cfu were able to evade filtration in both the 10 ml and 20 ml samples. c. jejuni cfu  were able to evade filtration in only the 10 ml sample. conclusions: the ef removes the majority of microbial contaminates from propofol with the exception of h. influenzae and c. jejuni. although the ef is capable of removing most of the microbial contamination produced by h. influenzae and c. jejuni, a few cfu are capable of evading filtration. consequently, even the use of a filter capable of removing microbial contaminants is not a substitute for meticulous aseptic technique and prompt administration when propofol is used.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  == there is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in australian animals. registration of antibiotics for use in animals  is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. in the late 1970s, the  animal health committee coordinated a survey of resistance in salmonella and escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine staphylococcus aureus. some additional information is available from published case reports. in samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the  market, no vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vana enterococci, including e. faecium and e. faecalis, were found in chickens. no vanb enterococci were detected in either species. virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig  and poultry isolates. multiple resistance was common in e. coli and salmonellae isolates. no fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, e. coli or campylobacter. beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. however, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli has been found in dogs.

TI  == rpod promoters in campylobacter jejuni exhibit a strong periodic signal instead of a -35 box.
AB  == we have used a hidden markov model (hmm) to identify the consensus sequence of the rpod promoters in the genome of campylobacter jejuni. the identified promoter consensus sequence is unusual compared to other bacteria, in that the region upstream of the tata-box does not contain a conserved -35 region, but shows a very strong periodic variation in the at-content and semi-conserved t-stretches,  with a period of 10-11 nucleotides. the tata-box is in some, but not all cases, preceded by a tgx, similar to an extended -10 promoter. we predicted a total of 764 presumed rpod promoters in the c.jejuni genome, of which 654 were located upstream of annotated genes. a similar promoter was identified in helicobacter pylori, a close phylogenetic relative of campylobacter, but not in escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, or six other proteobacterial genomes, or in staphylococcus aureus. we used upstream regions of high confidence genes as training data (n=529, for the c.jejuni genome). we found it necessary to limit the training set to genes that are preceded by an intergenic region of >100bp or by a gene oriented in the opposite direction to be able to identify a conserved sequence motif, and ended up with a training set of 175 genes. this leads to the conclusion that the remaining genes (354) are more rarely preceded by a (rpod) promoter, and consequently that operon structure may be more widespread in c.jejuni than has been assumed by others. structural predictions of the regions upstream of the tata-box indicates a region of highly curved dna, and we assume that this facilitates the wrapping of the dna around the rna polymerase holoenzyme, and offsets the absence of a conserved -35 binding motif.

TI  == a study of cross-contamination of food-borne pathogens in the domestic kitchen in the republic of ireland.
AB  == to date, there have been no published information and empirical data available on the role played by the food preparer in the domestic kitchen in the republic of ireland. in this study, we have looked at the incidence of potential food pathogens and their cross-infection in the domestic kitchen during the preparation of a sunday roast chicken lunch. key contact sites in the domestic kitchen were sampled, including the chicken carcass before and after the preparation of a roast chicken meal. twelve contact sites in twenty-five domestic kitchens were analysed and tested for aerobic plate count, salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. our findings identified the ability of food-borne disease microorganisms to become disseminated from infected foods, such as fresh chickens, to hand and food contact surfaces in the domestic kitchen, reiterating the need for consumer awareness and knowledge of effective hygiene procedures in the domestic kitchen.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (zurich, 2000)].
AB  == this paper describes the frequency of susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria against antibacterial agents. data are based on all susceptibility tests performed at the department of medical microbiology of the university of zurich in 2000. the evaluation of the results from 1987 to 2000 shows that susceptibilities against the antimicrobial agents tested have not markedly changed with the following exceptions: 7% of staphylococcus aureus are resistant against methicillin, 8% of pneumococci have a reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 1% is resistant to penicillin, and 10% are resistant to macrolides. 9% of group a streptococci are resistant to macrolides. quinolone resistance is markedly high in the medical practice with 10% of e. coli strains and 32% of campylobacter sp. strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli producing extended spectrum betalactamases are isolated occasionally. of all strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from clinical specimens in 2000, 4% were multi-drug resistant. the tables may be a help for the physician in his decision  for a "calculated chemotherapy" of bacterial infections.

TI  == trichuris suis: detection of antibacterial activity in excretory-secretory products from adults.
AB  == antibacterial activity was detected in excretory-secretory products (esp) of adult trichuris suis cultured in vitro in serum-free media. gram-negative bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and escherichia coli) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) were sensitive to esp. susceptibility was dependent on the concentration of esp but not on the inoculum  size. preliminary assessment of the mode of action suggests a bacteriocidal mechanism. this antibacterial activity was heat stable and resistant to digestion with pronase e and trypsin. based on ultrafiltration experiments, the activity is less than 10,000 mw. this excreted/secreted antibacterial activity from t. suis is likely a component of a humoral defense system for this helminth.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  == broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa). subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations  are required to generate clinically important resistance. in these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, which  is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.

AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and policy in belgium.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in belgium. a few examples to illustrate this problem: s. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of s. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; salmonella and campylobacter are becoming more and more  resistant to the fluoroquinolones. in hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the belgian hospitals. antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. the popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. in this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. we will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens salmonella and campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen e. coli. this resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of  compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. in belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. this information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. a unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. however, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. therefore, a coordination commission for antibiotic policy was installed recently by the ministers of social affairs, public health and agriculture.

TI  == health risks associated with unpasteurized goats' and ewes' milk on retail sale in england and wales. a phls dairy products working group study.
AB  == a pilot study to determine the microbiological quality of unpasteurized milk from goats and ewes sampled from farm shops, health food shops, and other retail premises found that 47%, (47/100) of goats' and 50% (13/26) of ewes' milk samples failed the standards prescribed by the dairy products (hygiene) regulations 1995. in addition, staphylococcus aureus, haemolytic streptococci or enterococci, were  present in excess of 10(2) c.f.u./ml in 9 (7 %) 2 (2 %) and 19 (15%) samples, respectively. salmonella, campylobacter, verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes were not detected in the samples. at the time  of purchase approximately half of the milk samples (58 %) were frozen, the rest were liquid. farm outlets sold predominantly liquid milk, other retail premises sold a frozen product. the microbiological quality of goats' and ewes' milk, whether frozen or liquid, was not significantly different. milk sold from farm shops was of lower quality than that from health food shops and other retail premises. in this pilot study most producers (92 %) supplied, and most retailers  (76 %) sold unpasteurized goats' and ewes' milk that contained unacceptable levels of indicator organisms. the study was carried out during the winter when goats' milk production is reduced. the results indicate the need for a full representative study of unpasteurized goats' and ewes' milk on retail sale throughout the year.

TI  == high-performance liquid chromatography determination of residue levels on chicken carcasses treated with cetylpyridinium chloride.
AB  == cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) has been found to be effective in reducing contamination of chicken carcasses from a variety of microorganisms, including escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni, aeromonas hydrophila, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. a procedure has been developed to determine residue levels on chicken carcasses after cpc treatment. for the analysis, chicken carcasses were extracted with 95% ethanol. the cpc concentration in the extract was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with ultraviolet detection using dodecylpyridinium chloride (dpc) as an internal standard. the method was validated in the concentration range of 3-200 microg/ml cpc in ethanolic extract. this assay is rapid, precise,  and accurate.

TI  == susceptibility in vitro of helicobacter pylori to cetylpyridinium chloride.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) which is used in therapy of oro-pharyngeal infections and for antiseptic treatment of the oral cavity is active against different bacterial species. determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) using the agar dilution technique revealed that the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori in vitro is highly susceptible to cpc as indicated by an mic of 10 microm (3.4 microg ml(-1)) which was significantly lower than the mic of cpc against other bacterial species, which were analyzed in comparison to h. pylori. bacteria of the genus campylobacter, various streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli showed higher mics ranging from 100 microm to 2 mm. in summary, this finding renders cpc-containing  drugs candidates possibly useful for eradication or for the prevention of transmission of the gastric pathogen.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  == the performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. the systems assessed were the microlog system (biolog inc., hayward, calif.), the microbial identification system (mis; midi inc., newark, del.), the vitek system (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.), the microscan walkaway 40 system (dade-microscan international, west sacramento, calif.), and the replianalyzer system (oxoid inc., nepean, ontario, canada). the sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. the sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. the sensitivity of mis for the identification of s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, and c. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. the sensitivity of the microlog system for the identification of e. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the vitek system  for the identification of b. cereus was 42.5%. the specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was mis for the identification of c. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when  it was tested with reference negative isolates including campylobacter coli and other campylobacter species. all systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of salmonella species and listeria species at the genus level. the repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. the choice of automated  microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.

TI  == irradiation as a method for decontaminating food. a review.
AB  == despite substantial efforts in avoidance of contamination, an upward trend in the number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by nonsporeforming pathogenic bacteria are reported in many countries. good hygienic practices can reduce the level of contamination but the most important pathogens cannot presently be eliminated from most farms nor is it possible to eliminate them by primary processing, particularly from those foods which are sold raw. several decontamination methods exist but the most versatile treatment among them is the  processing with ionizing radiation. decontamination of food by ionizing radiation is a safe, efficient, environmentally clean and energy efficient process. irradiation is particularly valuable as an endproduct decontamination procedure.  radiation treatment at doses of 2-7 kgy--depending on condition of irradiation and the food--can effectively eliminate potentially pathogenic nonsporeforming bacteria including both long-time recognized pathogens such as salmonella and staphylococcus aureus as well as emerging or "new" pathogens such as campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes or escherichia coli o157:h7 from suspected  food products without affecting sensory, nutritional and technical qualities. candidates of radiation decontamination are mainly poultry and red meat, egg products, and fishery products. it is a unique feature of radiation decontamination that it can also be performed when the food is in a frozen state. with today's demand for high-quality convenience foods, irradiation in combination with other processes holds a promise for enhancing the safety of many minimally processed foods. radiation decontamination of dry ingredients, herbs and enzyme preparations with doses of 3-10 kgy proved to be a viable alternative  to fumigation with microbicidal gases. radiation treatment at doses of 0.15-0.7 kgy under specific conditions appears to be feasible also for control of many foodborne parasites, thereby making infested foods safe for human consumption. microorganisms surviving low- and medium-dose radiation treatment are more sensitive to environmental stresses or subsequent food processing treatments than the microflora of unirradiated products. radiation treatment is an emerging technology in an increasing number of countries and more-and-more clearances on radiation decontaminated foods are issued or expected to be granted in the near future.

TI  == foodborne illness in the elderly.
AB  == the elderly (> or = 65 years of age) are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from foodborne-induced gastroenteritis than younger individuals. several factors contribute to the increased susceptibility to foodborne infections as well as other infections in elderly populations. these include an age-associated decrease in humoral and cellular immunity, age-related changes in  the gastrointestinal tract (decreased production of gastric acid and decreased intestinal motility), malnutrition, lack of exercise, entry into nursing homes, and excessive use of antibiotics. data from foodborne outbreaks associated with nursing homes indicate that the elderly are more likely to die from foodborne campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus infections than the general population. infections by salmonella species are the most common cause of illness and death in nursing homes with salmonella enteritidis as the major cause of both morbidity and mortality. while it is impossible to turn back the clock, practicing a healthy life-style with regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, receiving regular  health care, paying attention to personal hygiene, and monitoring food preparation and handling should lead to a reduced incidence of foodborne and other infections in the elderly.

TI  == resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in denmark: a baseline study for the danish integrated antimicrobial resistance monitoring programme (danmap).
AB  == this study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in denmark. the three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli/jejuni, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli,  staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). a total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from october 1995 through december 1996 were tested for susceptibility  to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in denmark. bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found.  the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. in general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. the results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in denmark. thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in denmark.
AB  == this study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in denmark. resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator  bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). all antimicrobials used as growth promoters in denmark and some structurally related  therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. a total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during october 1995 to september 1996 were included in the study. acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. a frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin,  olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. the highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. the results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria  from food animals in denmark. they will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == the microbiological examination of butchery products and butchers' premises in the united kingdom.
AB  == in a study of 1400 manufacturing butchers' premises, 2330 raw prepared meats, 2192 cooked meats and 4635 environmental samples were examined. verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7 (o157 vtec) was isolated from five of 1400 (0.4%) premises. three raw meat products contained o157 vtec, and two raw meat preparation areas and two items of equipment used exclusively for cooked meats were contaminated with o157 vtec. salmonella spp. and campylobacter  spp. were detected in 84 of 2330 (4%) and 15 of 2330 (0.6%) raw meat products, respectively. of the cooked meats examined, seven of 2192 (0.3%) samples were of  unacceptable microbiological quality and a further 352 (16%) were of unsatisfactory quality. of the unacceptable samples, two contained salmonella spp. (salm. typhimurium dt193, salm. typhimurium pt104), three contained staphylococcus aureus in excess of 10(4) cfu g-1, and two contained e. coli in excess of 10(4) cfu g-1. neither campylobacter spp. nor o157 vtec were detected in cooked meats. in the majority of premises, raw and unwrapped cooked meat products were physically separated in displays (94%) and refrigerators (81%), and dedicated equipment/utensils (69-89%) were used for raw meat and unwrapped cooked meat products and other ready-to-eat foods. in approximately half (48%), there were separate serving counters and in 13%, separate staff for raw and cooked meats. most managers (75%) had received some food hygiene training. however, in 29% of premises, one or more members of staff handled raw and then cooked or ready-to-eat foods without washing their hands, and in 11%, one or more staff members handled raw and cooked meats directly with bare hands. a documented hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp) system was present in 17% of premises and in a further 31%, an undocumented haccp system was in place. the low incidence of food-borne pathogens in cooked meat products and in the environmental areas examined, together with a high level of physical separation of raw and cooked meats, indicate that most manufacturing butchers' premises have appropriate physical control measures in place. however, haccp and hygienic practice are areas that require improvement to reduce the risk of cross-contamination with food-borne pathogens from raw to cooked meats.

TI  == trisodium phosphate increases sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria to lysozyme and nisin.
AB  == cell suspensions of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, and salmonella enteritidis exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.5  to 5 mm) of trisodium phosphate (tsp) for 10 min showed greatly increased susceptibility to lysozyme (10 micrograms ml-1) and/or nisin (1 microm). under optimal conditions at 37 degrees c, reductions in viable count after 30 min were  up to six log cycles. at 4 degrees c, c. jejuni showed greater resistance than at 37 degrees c, and maximal cell kills (95%) were reduced by more than two log cycles. cells dried on the surface of chicken skin were more resistant than suspended cells to tsp-lysozyme and tsp-nisin treatments; nevertheless, at 37 degrees c, kills varied from approximately 95% for s. enteritidis cells with nisin (30 microm) or lysozyme (100 micrograms ml-1) to > 99.9% for c. jejuni and  e. coli cells with nisin. under the experimental conditions used, nisin also reduced viable counts of skin-attached staphylococcus aureus by > 99.9%. the results suggest that the high tsp concentrations (approximately 10% wt/vol, 0.25  m) needed for successful decontamination of gram-negative bacteria, on the surface of poultry and other foodstuffs, may be substantially reduced by following tsp treatment with exposure to low lysozyme or nisin concentrations.

TI  == economic costs and trade impacts of microbial foodborne illness.
AB  == this article presents the economic costs of foodborne diseases for selected countries, the approaches used to calculate these costs, and a discussion on the  interaction between microbial food safety issues and international trade in food. the human illness costs due to foodborne pathogens are estimated most completely  in the united states of america, where, each year, 7 foodborne pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7. listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and toxoplasma gondii) cause an estimated 3.3-12.3 million cases of foodborne illness and up to 3900 deaths. these 7 pathogens are found in animal products and cost the united states an estimated $6.5-$34.9 billion (1995 us$) annually. the presence of foodborne pathogens in a country's food supply not only affects the health of the local population, but also represents a potential for spread to pathogens to visitors to the country and to consumers in countries which import food products. with more complete data on foodborne illnesses, deaths, costs and international trade  rejections in each country, indicators could be developed by which changes in food safety can be monitored.

TI  == safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  == the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry  to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level.  in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.

TI  == trends in bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in virtually all species of bacteria was recognized soon after the introduction of these compounds for clinical use more than 10 years ago. various resistance mechanisms, often interdependent, may explain different levels of resistance. epidemiological factors, local antibiotic policies, patients' characteristics, origin of the strains, and geographic location are among the factors contributing to highly variable resistance rates. during the last several years, resistance to fluoroquinolones has remained very high among methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and in intensive care unit patients, and it has increased among nosocomial isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. more worrisome are recent reports of an overall increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones among bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections, such as escherichia coli, salmonella species, campylobacter species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  more than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic  rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for c. difficile enterotoxin. however, 27 cefmetazole-induced  diarrheic cases were not associated with c. difficile. other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as campylobacter spp., bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens and clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. however, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. this was ascribed to the overgrowth of clostridium innocuum and clostridium sporogenes. there were no remarkable differences in changes in other  bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.

TI  == differentiation of bacterial 16s rrna genes and intergenic regions and mycobacterium tuberculosis katg genes by structure-specific endonuclease cleavage.
AB  == we describe here a new approach for analyzing nucleic acid sequences using a structure-specific endonuclease, cleavase i. we have applied this technique to the detection and localization of mutations associated with isoniazid resistance  in mycobacterium tuberculosis and for differentiating bacterial genera, species and strains. the technique described here is based on the observation that single strands of dnas can assume defined conformations, which can be detected and cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases such as cleavase i. the patterns of fragments produced are characteristic of the sequences responsible for the structure, so that each dna has its own structural fingerprint. amplicons, containing either a single 5'-fluorescein or 5'-tetramethyl rhodamine label were  generated from a 620-bp segment of the katg gene of isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive m. tuberculosis, the 5' 350 bp of the 16s rrna genes of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella arizonae, shigella sonnei, shigella dysenteriae, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus, hominis, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus aureus and an approximately 550-bp dna segment comprising the intergenic region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella  arizonae, shigella sonnei, and shigella dysenteriae serotypes 1, 2, and 8. changes in the structural fingerprints of dna fragments derived from the katg genes of isoniazid-resistant m. tuberculosis isolates were clearly identified and could be mapped to the site of the actual mutation relative to the labeled end. bland patterns which clearly differentiated bacteria to the level of genus and, in some cases, species were generated from the 16s genes. cleavase i analysis of  the intergenic regions of salmonella and shigella species differentiated genus, species, and serotypes. structural fingerprinting by digestion with cleavase i is a rapid, simple, and sensitive method for analyzing nucleic acid sequences and may find wide utility in microbial analysis.

TI  == hazard identification in swine slaughter with respect to foodborne bacteria.
AB  == swine slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the contamination  of the pork carcass with potentially pathogenic bacteria; however, it does not contain any point where hazards are completely eliminated. data on the prevalence of various pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter coli/jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica) in pigs, their growth and survival characteristics and ability to become established on the slaughter line are presented. the presentation covers the processing steps from lairage to chilling and is based on swine slaughter practices in denmark, norway and sweden. the major contamination points during swine slaughter are pig-related, such as faecal and pharyngeal, and environmental. haccp (hazard analysis critical control point) and gmp (good manufacturing practice) in swine slaughter must be focused on limiting this spread. the pathogenic bacteria show differences in their general mechanism of distribution. the major contamination source of campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and y. enterocolitica is the pig, and the contamination of carcasses with these bacteria may be limited, provided that only strict slaughtering procedures  are used. other organisms such as aeromonas spp., l. moncytogenes/listeria spp. and s. aureus can be endemic in the processing environment. since endemic bacteria can be controlled by proper cleaning and disinfection, these organisms are useful as indicators for the success of gmp rules. the following affiliation  to cps or ccps made for specific steps during slaughter and dressing may serve as a guidance: (i) lairage (cp), (ii) killing (cp), (iii) scalding (cp), (iv) dehairing (cp), (v) singeing/flaming (cp), (vi) polishing (cp), (vii) circumanal  incision and removal of the intestines (ccp), (viii) excision of the tongue, pharynx, and in particular the tonsils (ccp), (ix) splitting (cp), (x) post mortem inspection procedures (ccp) and (xi) deboning of the head (ccp).

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

TI  == efficacy of a lactic acid/sodium benzoate wash solution in reducing bacterial contamination of raw chicken.
AB  == raw chicken wings inoculated with salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, or escherichia coli o157:h7 were washed in  water (control) or a solution of a 0.5% lactic acid/0.05% sodium benzoate (lb) (ph 2.64) for 30 min. viable cells of pathogenic bacteria and naturally occurring psychrotrophic bacteria on wings were enumerated after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days of  storage at 4 degrees c. lower populations of pathogenic and psychrotrophic bacteria were detected on wings immediately after washing with lb compared to populations detected on control wings. lb solution was more effective in killing  salmonella, c. jejuni, and e. coli o157:h7 than l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus.  during refrigerated storage, populations of salmonella, c. jejuni, l. monocytogenes, and e. coli o157:h7 decreased significantly on lb-washed wings, as compared to populations of respective pathogens on control wings. the growth of psychrotrophic bacteria on lb-washed wings was significantly retarded as compared to growth on control wings during refrigerated storage. washing chicken wings with a solution containing 0.5% lactic acid and 0.05% sodium benzoate can greatly reduce the populations of pathogenic and psychotrophic bacteria, thus enhancing safety and extending shelf life.

TI  == expression of adhesion molecules on human granulocytes after stimulation with helicobacter pylori membrane proteins: comparison with membrane proteins from other bacteria.
AB  == type b gastritis in its active form is characterized by a dense infiltration of the lamina propria with granulocytes. since the bacterium helicobacter pylori does not invade the epithelial barrier, a signaling pathway chemoattractive for granulocytes must exist across this mucosal boarder. one possible mechanism tested was whether granulocytes are directly activated by water-soluble membrane  proteins (wsp) from h. pylori. these findings were compared with the effects of wsp from other bacteria (helicobacter felis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus). a unique activation pattern by h. pylori wsp was found. like all other wsp tested, they induced an upregulation of cd11b but had no influence on cd11c and, most strikingly, cd62l expression. in contrast, e. coli wsp, e.g., not only induce a strong cd11b and cd11c expression but also lead to a loss in surface cd62l. the lack of cd62l shedding conserves rolling of granulocytes along the endothelium, creating a favorable precondition for granulocytes to stick more readily to activated endothelium after h. pylori stimulation via cd11b-cd54 receptor-counterreceptor interaction. this may explain why h. pylori infection is a very strong stimulus for granulocyte infiltration. the active fraction for the induction of cd11b on granulocytes is a heat- and protease-sensitive protein with a molecular mass between 30 and 100 kda. one activation step involved may be the binding of wsp to cd15 determinants on granulocytes with subsequent induction of cd11b.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones: state-of-the-art 1992-1994.
AB  == this paper gives an update on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. the laboratory techniques currently used to determine the mechanism(s) of resistance are outlined, including the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis of mutations in gyra. alterations in gyra have continued to be the most  reported cause of resistance, with high level resistance due to 2 or more mutations in this gene. recently, mutations in gyra of mycobacterium tuberculosis and campylobacter jejuni have been described. complementation studies with plasmid encoded cloned gyrb from escherichia coli suggest that high fluoroquinolone resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration = 32 mg/l) in salmonella typhimurium can be due to mutation in both gyra and gyrb. decreased fluoroquinolone accumulation into e. coli has been shown to be due to mutations in a number of genes at different loci. current interest has focused upon the marrab and soxrs loci, with mutations in genes of either loci giving rise to decreased susceptibility to several unrelated drugs, including fluoroquinolones,  tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams, and decreased expression of  ompf. the genetic characterisation of fluoroquinolone efflux from staphylococcus  aureus has shown that efflux occurs in both fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant bacteria. the most likely cause of resistance is overexpression of nora, giving rise to increased efflux. recently, 2 efflux systems in pseudomonas  aeruginosa have been proposed, mexa-mexb-oprk and mexc-mexd-oprm, conferring decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == selection of a gyra mutant of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to fluoroquinolones during treatment with ofloxacin.
AB  == a strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to ofloxacin was selected in a patient with a long history of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis eventually treated by ofloxacin combined with other second-line drugs. a mutation in the gyra gene was hypothesized to be the mechanism of acquired resistance to ofloxacin in this strain. chromosomal dna of strains mtb1, isolated before treatment and susceptible to ofloxacin (mic, 1 microgram/ml), and mtb2, isolated  during treatment and resistant to ofloxacin (mic, 32 micrograms/ml), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using two oligonucleotide primers highly homologous to dna sequences flanking the quinolone resistance-determining  region in gyra of mycobacteria. comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 150-bp fragments obtained by pcr revealed a point mutation in mtb2 leading to the substitution of histidine for aspartic acid at a position corresponding to residues involved in quinolone resistance in escherichia coli (asp87), staphylococcus aureus (glu88), and campylobacter jejuni (asp90).

TI  == effect of ionizing dose rate on the radioresistance of some food pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == food pathogenic bacteria including listeria monocytogenes (1a1 and atcc 19111), staphylococcus aureus (gd13 and atcc 13565), escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 35150), salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio parahaemolyticus, and campylobacter jejuni were exposed to various rates of ionizing radiation (0.78, 2.6, and 22 kgy/h) emitted by three different 60co irradiators. d10 values (d10 is the radiation dose required to eliminate 90% of a bacterial population (one logarithmic cycle reduction)) were calculated for the various strains and growth conditions tested. a covariance analysis of these results revealed that the dose rates studied had no significant influence on the radiosensitivity of these bacteria. at all dose rates, the bacteria were more radiosensitive when irradiated in a saline solution (0.85% nacl) than in a chicken breast meat suspension. the growth phase of the bacterial population had a variable influence on its radioresistance. for l. monocytogenes 1a1, staphylococcus aureus atcc 13565, e. coli o157:h7, y. enterocolitica, and v. parahaemolyticus, radioresistance was not significantly different in the exponential and stationary phases. populations of l. monocytogenes atcc 19111 and staphylococcus aureus gd13 were significantly more resistant in the stationary phase (d10 = 0.23 and 0.12 kgy, respectively) than in the exponential phase (d10 = 0.17 and 0.09 kgy, respectively). among the pathogenic bacteria investigated in this study, the most radioresistant was l. monocytogenes (d10 = 0.16-0.38 kgy, gram-positive bacilli)  and the most radiosensitive was v. parahaemolyticus (d10 = 0.03-0.04 kgy, halophilic gram-negative bacilli).

TI  == mechanisms of quinolone resistance.
AB  == two mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones are known: (i) alteration of the molecular target of quinolone action-dna gyrase, and (ii) reduction of the quinolone accumulation. mutations altering the n-terminus of the gyrase a subunit, especially those around residues ser83 and asp87, significantly reduce the susceptibilities towards all quinolones, while alterations of the gyrase b subunit are rarely found and are of minor importance. reduced drug accumulation is associated with alterations of the outer membrane protein profile in gram-negative bacteria. such mutations include the mara locus in escherichia coli and result in low level resistance towards quinolones and unrelated drugs. increased activity of naturally existing efflux systems, such as the transmembrane protein nora of staphylococci, may also lead to reduced accumulation in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. clinical fluoroquinolone resistance is rarely found in intrinsically highly susceptible organisms such as enterobacteriaceae and involves a combination of at least two mutations. in contrast, species with moderate intrinsic susceptibility such as campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus require only one mutation to become clinically resistant. as a consequence development of resistance during therapy may result from acquisition of already resistant strains in the case of susceptible species, and selection of mutants in the case  of less susceptible species.

TI  == the epidemiology of bacterial resistance to quinolones.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones have been in use for nearly 10 years in the treatment of community- and nosocomially-acquired infections. resistant clones may be selected during therapy and disseminate if favourable epidemiological conditions prevail.  resistance to the fluoroquinolones is still rare in common pathogens with 97 to 100% of strains remaining susceptible. resistance has been reported in methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni/coli, salmonella, shigella and escherichia coli. among nosocomial pathogens, the incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance varies between bacterial species, countries and periods of study, and is dependent on local epidemiological factors and antibiotic policies. the highest incidence of resistance is observed in serratia and acinetobacter spp., and particularly in methicillin-resistant s. aureus. surveillance programmes are needed to follow up trends in resistance to the fluoroquinolones and their possible association with clinical failures.

AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == a comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  == on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-o-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. moraxella catarrhalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and b. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter coli/jejuni and the b. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. there was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. reports of potentiation of the activity  against haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == relationship between the clostridium perfringens catq gene product and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from other bacteria.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the clostridium perfringens chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat)-encoding resistance determinant, catq, was determined. an open reading frame encoding a protein of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight  of 26,014 was identified. although catq was expressed constitutively, sequences similar in structure to those found upstream of inducible cat genes were observed. the catq gene was distinct from the c. perfringens catp determinant. the deduced catq monomer had considerable amino acid sequence conservation compared with catp (53% similarity) and other known cat proteins (39 to 53%). phylogenetic analysis revealed that the catq monomer was as closely related to cat proteins from staphylococcus aureus and campylobacter coli as it was to cat monomers from the clostridia.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas, salmonella, and yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. gram-positive bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to microgard. kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% microgard. optimum activity of microgard was at ph 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria  present as well as the genus tested. blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of microgard against pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == acidity and intestinal bacteria: an in-vitro assessment of the bactericidal activity of hydrochloric acid on intestinal pathogens.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of hydrochloric acid (hcl) on different intestinal bacteria was evaluated at various ph values and time intervals. the effect of hcl was highest at ph 2 and ph 3 on strains of campylobacter jejuni, aeromonas hydrophila, plesiomonas shigelloides, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella spp. and shigella spp., producing complete killing after 60 min incubation. however, at higher ph values (ph 4 and above), these organisms not only survived but they  also showed evidence of rapid multiplication. in contrast, clinical and standard  strains of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all the ph values. highest sensitivity to hcl was observed with strains of shigella spp.  and salmonella spp. it is conceivable that patients with normal gastric acidity should not suffer from gastroenteritis caused by these intestinal pathogens.

TI  == [basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (nflx), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. serum concentrations and urinary excretion of nflx after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. the mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. the mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine  from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. a dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of nflx were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. in 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, escherichia  coli 10 strains, salmonella sp. 5 strains, morganella morganii 1 strain, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of  c. jejuni only decreased. with regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were  observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. no abnormal laboratory test data were observed. from the  above results, nflx was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.

AB  == a total of 152 strains of campylobacter jejuni, c. coli, c. laridis and c. fetus  subsp. fetus were tested for haemolysis on blood agar plates. distinct haemolysis was detected in 92.3% (96/104) of strains of c. jejuni and 21.7% (5/23) of strains of c. coli on sheep blood heart infusion agar after incubation for 4 d microaerobically at 42 degrees c. haemolysis was also detected on horse blood heart infusion agar. haemolysis was not detected at 37 degrees c except with one  of 50 strains of c. jejuni tested at this temperature, which was weakly positive. campylobacter laridis was not haemolytic; c. fetus subsp. fetus, which does not grow at 42 degrees c, showed no haemolysis at 37 degrees c. blood agar (oxoid, ba base no. 2) was not suitable for testing for haemolysis by these organisms. a microaerobic gas mixture containing hydrogen is better than that containing nitrogen because the medium has a brighter colour, making haemolysis easier to detect. there was no synergistic haemolysis with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. the plate haemolysis test as described here may aid differentiation within the thermophilic campylobacters.

TI  == [infectious diarrhea in the adult].
AB  == infectious diarrhoeas are usually divided into two types; toxinogenic and invasive. invasive diarrhoeas are copious and responsible for dehydration which is the principal clinical sign; mucosal lesions and bacteraemia are absent. the most typical of toxinogenic diarrhoeas is cholera, but enterotoxicogenic e. coli  and aeromonas infections have similar clinical features. in invasive diarrhoeas the responsible microorganisms penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine, producing fever and stools that contain blood and mucus. however, some organisms causing invasive diarrhoeas secrete cytotoxins; they include shigella spp., salmonella spp, some strains of e. coli, campylobacter jejuni and yersinia  spp. when diarrhoea occurs in patients under antibiotics pseudomembranous colitis due to the proliferation of clostridium difficile must be suspected; the diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy and confirmed by bacteriology. toxic and infectious diarrhoeas due to food are increasingly frequent; they are usually caused by salmonella spp., but sometimes by clostridium perfringens or staphylococcus aureus. in patients with suspected infectious diarrhoea symptomatic treatment combined or not with intestinal antibacterial agents is immediately initiated in most cases; stool cultures are reserved to severe or protracted diarrhoeas. specimens must be collected under the best conditions and  rapidly sent to the laboratory.

TI  == binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate.
AB  == bismuth subsalicylate (bss) is a compound without significant aqueous solubility  that is widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. bss was able to bind bacteria of diverse species, and these bound bacteria were subsequently killed. a 4-log10 reduction of viable bacteria occurred within 4 h after a 10 mm  aqueous suspension of bss was inoculated with 2 x 10(6) escherichia coli cells per ml. binding and killing were dependent on the levels of inoculated bacteria,  and significant binding but little killing of the exposed bacteria occurred at an inoculum level of 2 x 10(9) e. coli per ml. intracellular atp decreased rapidly after exposure of e. coli to 10 mm bss and, after 30 min, was only 1% of the original level. extracellular atp increased after exposure to bss, but the accumulation of extracellular atp was not sufficient to account for the loss of intracellular atp. the killing of bacteria exposed to bss may have been due to cessation of atp synthesis or a loss of membrane integrity. bactericidal activity of bss was also investigated in a simulated gastric juice at ph 3. killing of e.  coli at this ph was much more rapid than at ph 7 and was apparently due to salicylate released by the conversion of bss to bismuth oxychloride. it is proposed that the binding and killing observed for bss contribute to the efficacy of this compound against gastrointestinal infections such as traveler's diarrhea.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu  per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and  branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd  117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to  date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.

TI  == a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci  were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold  dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin  against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == spectrum and mode of action of azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new 15-membered-ring macrolide with improved potency against gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (cp-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin a; also designated xz-450 [pliva pharmaceuticals, zagreb, yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. it was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against branhamella catarrhalis, campylobacter species, and legionella species. it had activity similar to that of erythromycin against chlamydia spp. azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family enterobacteriaceae; its mic for 90% of strains of escherichia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. it displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates. it had moderate activity against bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. the  mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14c]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of apha-3 genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant apha-3 encoded by transposon tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pjh1 and pip1433 from streptococcus faecalis and campylobacter  coli, respectively. the three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid psh2 from staphylococcus aureus. comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the apha-3 gene in pjh1 and in tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pip1433. in the latter plasmid, apha-3 is transcribed from a promoter, p1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. the rearrangement observed in pjh1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of p1. the promoter thus generated. p1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as p1. however, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical  promoter p1 is significantly less efficient than p1'. from analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in  strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. the transition from pip1433 to pjh1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the apha-3 gene. the deletion event in tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed p1 in  its entirety.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == typing of heat-stable and heat-labile antigens of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli by coagglutination.
AB  == a coagglutination system has been devised for typing heat-stable and heat-labile  antigens of campylobacter jejuni and c. coli. the use of protein a-positive staphylococcus aureus cells carrying campylobacter sp. serotype antibody and the  treatment of campylobacter sp. cells with dnase in the antigen suspension permitted rapid and specific coagglutination of rough (autoagglutinable) as well  as smooth cultures. cells of s. aureus were sensitized with campylobacter sp. serotype antisera. four to five types of sensitized s. aureus cells were pooled.  a strain of campylobacter sp. was first tested with the pools and then typed with the individual reagents of the reactive pool. after the described procedures, 68  serotype strains tested blindly as unknowns were correctly typed according to their heat-stable or heat-labile antigens. the two most commonly used typing schemes which are based separately on the heat-stable or the heat-labile antigens as assayed by passive hemagglutination and slide agglutination, respectively, can be utilized simultaneously in the coagglutination system for strain characterization. the coagglutination system is simple, yields results rapidly, conserves typing reagents, and offers the flexibility of formulating the pools of reagents according to the experimental design or the prevalence of serotypes in a geographic location. it should be a practical system for the typing of campylobacter spp. in public health or clinical laboratories.

AB  == in a 12-month survey (june 1982-may 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. the statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees c and by  76% at 22 degrees c. there were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 escherichia coli per ml in 91%. staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of yersinia enterocolitica. salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. the methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. no sample was brucella ring-test-positive. experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored  goat's milk showed that bacillus cereus, staph. aureus, salmonella typhimurium and y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees c. clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while campylobacter jejuni did not grow. the results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
