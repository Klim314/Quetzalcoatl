TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated in cases of pertussis-like syndrome].
AB  == objective: to describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). methods: in all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. the analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). results:  a total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. b. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. as for other bacteria, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. the respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. among mycoplasma, ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. the male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. the recovery of b. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. in contrast, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. conclusions: most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. the recovery percentages of b. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.

TI  == viruses and bacteria in bronchial samples from patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia.
AB  == viruses and bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, protected specimen brush samples, and bronchial biopsies from 14 patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia (11 patients with common variable immunodeficiency [cvid] and three patients with x-linked agammaglobulinemia [xla]) were analyzed. at the  time of the study, the patients had no signs of acute respiratory infections, and no antibiotics were administered. in addition to routine bacterial and viral cultures, polymerase chain reaction tests were used for the detection of adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (cmv), herpes simplex virus 1, enterovirus, rhinovirus, borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella spp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, pneumocystis carinii, and ureaplasma urealyticum. viruses  (four adenoviruses, one cmv, and one rhinovirus) were detected in four of the 11  (36%) cvid patients. no viruses were found in the three patients with xla or in 13 control patients. bacteria from the lower respiratory tract were detected in nine of the 14 (64%) patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and three of the 13 (23%) control patients. haemophilus influenzae was the most prevalent bacterium (43%) in the hypogammaglobulinemia patients. the study shows that patients with cvid harbor viral and bacterial infections in the lower respiratory tract, which  may predispose to the development of changes in the respiratory tract.

TI  == in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25  mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia  spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.

TI  == history of macrolide use in pediatrics.
AB  == erythromycin, the prototypical macrolide, has been widely used since the 1950s in the management of pediatric infections. erythromycin is the drug of choice for infants and children with legionnaire's disease, pertussis, diphtheria, lower respiratory tract infections caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and chlamydia trachomatis and enteritis caused by campylobacter jejuni. it is also indicated for treatment of syphilis; for streptococcal, staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections; genital infections caused by ureaplasma urealyticum; and for the prevention of rheumatic fever and endocarditis in patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. the new macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are also active against borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, cryptosporidium spp. and toxoplasma gondii. erythromycin is associated with a low risk of serious side effects, although gastric distress occurs in a significant proportion of patients. drug interactions with theophylline, carbamazepine, warfarin, cyclosporine, terfenadine and digoxin limit erythromycin use. the newer macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are more stable, better absorbed and better tolerated than erythromycin. azithromycin is more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae. excellent tissue and intracellular penetration may contribute to their clinical efficacy. in children both azithromycin and clarithromycin are indicated for acute otitis media caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and for pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes. (as of december, 1996,  azithromycin for oral suspension was approved for community-acquired pneumonia in children caused by c. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. pneumoniae and s. pneumoniae.) claritromycin is also indicated for acute maxillary sinusitis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia and disseminated mycobacterial infections. azithromycin and clarithromycin are associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, a low rate of drug discontinuation caused by side effects and a low potential for interaction with other drugs.

TI  == bacterial 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction in the detection of intra-amniotic infection.
AB  == objective: bacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to detect early subclinical intraamhiotic infection. we used universal primers which amplify a dna fragment of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) from all known bacteria and sequenced the positive samples to identify the bacterial species. design: transabdominally  obtained amniotic fluid samples from 20 pregnant women with prelabour rupture of  the fetal membranes (prom), showing no signs of clinical infection, and 16 control samples were analysed with universal bacterial pcr. in addition, routine  bacterial culture and amniotic fluid glucose were studied. results: out of 20 prom patients, five were positive in the pcr. pcr detected ureaplasma urealyticum in two cases, haemophilus influenzae in one case, streptococcus oralis in one case and fusobacterium sp. in one case. only two of these were positive in a routine bacterial culture. both were multibacterial infections, which caused discrepancies between the pcr and culture results. two patients developed infectious complications: both were identified with the pcr assay. amniotic fluid glucose was lower in pcr positive patients compared with pcr negative patients. conclusion: bacterial 16s rdna pcr, in properly controlled conditions, promises to be a fast and reliable test for early intra-amniotic infection especially concerning ureaplasma urealyticum.

TI  == [macrolides. new therapeutic prospects].
AB  == the aim of the development of semisynthetic derivatives was to overcome the problem of chemical stability of erythromycin a in acid medium, with less variability in gastro-intestinal absorption and leading to renewed interest in macrolides. the new macrolides have the same antibacterial spectrum as erythromycin a including gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, intracellular bacteria, mycoplasma, campylobacter sp., helicobacter pylori, mycobacteria spp.,  gram-negative bacilli including haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, pasteurella multocida, gram-positive bacilli including corynebacterium diphtheriae and anaerobic species. in vitro activity against haemophilus influenzae is still a controversial subject. macrolides are among the best tolerated antibacterial agents. theoretically, macrolides could be given to a large range of patients even those suffering from underlying diseases. the new macrolides, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, rokitamycin and miokamycin, are indicated for the treatment of upper respiratory  tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections due to intracellular bacteria or mycoplasma pneumoniae. macrolides could be used as first line therapy for non-gonococcal urethritis, especially those due to chlamydia trachomatis or ureaplasma urealyticum. in pelvic inflammatory infections in which chlamydia trachomatis is involved macrolides could also be used. other non-conventional indications under discussion are h. pylori and lyme's disease. macrolides in combination with other antibacterials could be an alternative for mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. the antiparasite effect of erythromycin has been known since the 1950s. extensive experimental work is currently underway to determine the potential use of these drugs in this setting. research during the 80s in the macrolide field, led to enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. current research is focused on expanding the antibacterial spectrum and to overcome cross-resistance among 14-membered-ring macrolides.

TI  == miocamycin. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential.
AB  == miocamycin is an orally administered 16-membered macrolide antimicrobial drug. it has a spectrum of in vitro activity similar to that of erythromycin, inhibiting a range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, atypical microbes and some anaerobes. importantly, miocamycin demonstrates greater in vitro potency than erythromycin against several pathogens including legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. equally noteworthy is its activity against erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal and streptococcal species  expressing inducible-type resistance. miocamycin possesses poor overall activity  against haemophilus influenzae and is inactive against enterobacteriaceae. penetration of miocamycin into body tissues and fluids is both rapid and extensive. the 3 major metabolites of miocamycin possess antimicrobial activity and may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. clinical data indicate that miocamycin is useful in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both adult and paediatric patients. miocamycin is also effective in the treatment of urogenital tract infections caused by chlamydia trachomatis or u. urealyticum. several studies suggest that miocamycin  is at least as effective as erythromycin in these indications; however, comparisons with newer macrolide agents have yet to be performed. in other studies, miocamycin proved to be a useful agent in the treatment of periodontal infections and as anti-infective prophylaxis in dental surgery. miocamycin appears to have a tolerability profile qualitatively similar to that of other macrolides, with gastrointestinal and skin disorders being the most commonly reported adverse events. current data suggest that the potential for drug interactions with miocamycin is low, with the possible exceptions of carbamazepine and cyclosporin. thus, although further confirmation and elaboration of various aspects of its efficacy and tolerability profile is needed, at this stage miocamycin offers a useful alternative oral therapy to erythromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory tract infections and nongonococcal urethritis.

TI  == unique susceptibility of patients with antibody deficiency to mycoplasma infection.
AB  == patients with congenital or acquired disorders of antibody production suffer from a wide variety of infections. they are most often bacterial and due to haemophilus influenzae or streptococcus pneumoniae. chronic pulmonary disease accounts for most of the deaths. while non-urogenital tract infections due to ureaplasma urealyticum or other mycoplasmas are unusual in individuals with normal resistance, patients with antibody deficiency demonstrate a unique susceptibility. with increasing frequency, patients with impaired humoral immunity have been shown to have a mycoplasmal infection that results in pneumonitis, sinusitis, cystitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, or cellulitis. the mycoplasmas may be responsible for chronic sinopulmonary disease in a majority of such patients. awareness of the role these organisms play in causing infection in antibody-deficient patients and the institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy will contribute to an improvement in clinical outcome.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. spanish collaborative group.
AB  == the activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups c, g and f, brucella melitensis, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against campylobacter spp. in general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. clarithromycin was bactericidal against streptococcus spp. and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == the new macrolides: expanding the ways in antibiotic treatment.
AB  == after almost forty years of its introduction, erythromycin will not be the exclusive member of the macrolide group of antibiotic agents, but a new generation of its derivatives which surpass it in pharmacological properties and  clinical efficacy will also be available. clarithromycin, a 14-membered derivative, has shown acid stability, longer half-life, lower protein binding and higher lung tissue penetration. its exceedingly high activity against erythromycin-susceptible gram-positive cocci, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella pneumophila makes it and important alternative choice in the therapy of respiratory tract infections. also, it has shown high activity against chlamydia trachomatis, and high urinary clearance of this unmetabolized molecule, important properties which would render it a special role in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections. azithromycin, a 15-membered derivative has shown  enhanced basicity (due to the nitrogen atom in its lactone ring), longer half-life and lower protein bindings. its exceptional activity against hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, ureaplasma urealyticum and gram-negative bacteria, and its high concentration in tonsillar,  pulmonary, prostatic and female reproductive tract tissues, assigns it an honorific place among the macrolides in the therapy against respiratory tract and genitourinary tract infections. its role against t. gondii deserves further study, but points out this agent as a promise against this parasite.

TI  == mycoplasmal infections of cerebrospinal fluid in newborn infants from a community hospital population.
AB  == mycoplasma hominis or ureaplasma urealyticum have previously been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) in 13 of 100 newborn infants tested from a high risk university hospital population where the mothers were of predominantly lower income and socioeconomic status and had often received little or no prenatal care. we sought to determine whether such infections occur in neonates born to women cared for mainly through private obstetric practices and who delivered in 4 suburban community hospitals. csf cultures were done in 318 infants during an 8-month period. m. hominis was isolated from 9 and u. urealyticum from 5 csf cultures. four infants infected with u. urealyticum and 3 infected with m. hominis were born at term. one infant infected with u. urealyticum had a birth weight of less than 1000 g. in 5 infants clearance of the infecting organism was  documented without specific treatment. twelve infants had good perinatal outcomes regardless of treatment and 2 died. one death in a 2240-g infant infected with m. hominis was associated with haemophilus influenzae sepsis and pneumonia. the other death occurred 3 days after birth in a 630-g infant infected with u. urealyticum who had evidence of meningitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. results of this study suggest that mycoplasmas are common causes of neonatal csf  infections, not only in high risk populations, but also in the general population.
