TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == probiotics in the prevention of eczema: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. design: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. settings: antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. patients:  pregnant women and their infants. interventions: women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (lactobacillus salivarius cul61, lactobacillus paracasei cul08, bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium bifidum cul20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. main outcome measure: diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. infants were followed up by questionnaire. clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. results: the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; or 1.07, 95% ci 0.72 to 1.6). among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; or 0.52, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.98). the  statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months. atopic eczema occurred in 9/171 (5.3%) children in the probiotic arm and 21/173 (12.1%) in the  placebo arm (or 0.40, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91). conclusions: the study did not provide evidence that the probiotic either prevented eczema during the study or reduced its severity. however, the probiotic seemed to prevent atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and so reduce the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood. trial registration number: isrctn26287422.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == galacto-oligosaccharides have prebiotic activity in a dynamic in vitro colon model using a (13)c-labeling technique.
AB  == galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) are considered to be prebiotic, although the contribution of specific members of the microbiota to gos fermentation and the exact microbial metabolites that are produced upon gos fermentation are largely unknown. we aimed to determine this using uniformly (13)c-labeled gos. the normal (control) medium and unlabeled or (13)c-labeled gos was added to a dynamic, validated, in vitro model of the large-intestine containing an adult-type microbiota. liquid-chromatography ms was used to measure the incorporation of (13)c label into metabolites. 16s-rrna stable isotope probing coupled to a phylogenetic micro-array was used to determine label incorporation in microbial biomass. the primary members within the complex microbiota that were directly involved in gos fermentation were shown to be bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, lactobacillus gasseri, and l. salivarius, in line with the prebiotic effect of gos, although some other species incorporated (13)c label also. gos fermentation led to an increase in acetate (+49%) and lactate (+23%) compared with the control. total organic acid production was 8.50 and 7.52 mmol/g of carbohydrate fed for the gos and control experiments, respectively. at the same time, the cumulative production of putrefactive metabolites (branched-chain  fatty acids and ammonia) was reduced by 55%. cross-feeding of metabolites from primary gos fermenters to other members of the microbiota was observed. our findings support a prebiotic role for gos and its potential to act as a synbiotic in combination with certain probiotic strains.

TI  == effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: atopic dermatitis, a chronic recurrent disease, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. in the last 30 years, the prevalence of atopic  dermatitis has rapidly increased due to industrialization. therefore, there have  been attempts in recent years to find new ways of treating and preventing atopic  dermatitis. objective: in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a combination of bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus salivarius strains were evaluated in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. methods: forty pediatric patients (23 males and 17 females) aged 1~13 years were enrolled. one eligible individual who was approached declined to participate. the probiotic group was administered a probiotic complex containing b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, l. casei, and l. salivarius for 8 weeks. the placebo group, on the other hand, was administered skim milk powder and dextrose. all of the parameters including serum cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein), scoring atopic dermatitis (scorad) index, and total serum immunoglobulin e (ige) were measured in both the probiotic group and the placebo group at the end of 8 weeks. results: probiotic intervention in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients effectively reduced the scorad index and serum cytokines interleukin (il)-5, il-6, interferon (ifn)-gamma, and total serum ige levels, but did not reduce levels of serum cytokines il-2, il-4, il-10, ecp, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) compared to the placebo group. conclusion: our study found probiotics to be effective in reducing atopic dermatitis patients' scorad index, serum il-5, il-6, ifn-gamma, and total serum ige levels but not effective in reducing serum il-2, il-4, il-10, ecp, or tnf-alpha levels.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == dietary supplementation with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is well tolerated and not associated with adverse events during late pregnancy and early infancy.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health. although these organisms have a long record of safe use, it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants. two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius cul61 and lactobacillus paracasei cul08) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20) with a total of 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units were administered  daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. adverse events (ae) were classified according to who international statistical classification of diseases criteria. common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires. baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar. compliance with the trial interventions, loss to follow-up, symptoms, drug usage, infant growth, method of  feeding, visits to the doctor, and mothers' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups. fifteen (6.8%) mothers and 73 (33.2%) infants in the treatment group and 21 (9.0%) mothers and 75 (32.1%) infants in the placebo group reported ae (p = 0.49 and p = 0.84, respectively). severe ae occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group. none of the ae were attributed to the intervention. our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy.

TI  == antigen-presenting cells exposed to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, bifidobacterium bifidum bi-98, and bi-504 reduce regulatory t cell activity.
AB  == background: the effect in vitro of six different probiotic strains including lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ys8866441, lactobacillus plantarum lp-115, bifidobacterium bifidum bi-504 and bi-98 was studied on splenic enteroantigen-presenting cells (apc) and cd4(+)cd25(+) t-regulatory cells (tregs) in splenocyte-t cell proliferation assays. methods: splenocytes exposed to enteroantigen +/- probiotics were used to stimulate cultured cd4(+)cd25(-) t cells to which titrated numbers of tregs were added. cytokine assays were performed by use of neutralizing antibodies and elisa. results: exposure of apcs  to enteroantigens and the series of probiotic strains mentioned above did not influence the stimulatory capacity of apcs on proliferative enteroantigen-specific t cells. however, exposure to b. bifidum bi-98, bi-504 and l. acidophilus ncfm consistently reduced the suppressive activity of tregs. the suppressive activity was analyzed using fractionated components of the probiotics, and showed that a component of the cell wall is responsible for the decreased treg activity in the system. the probiotic-induced suppression of treg  function is not mediated by changes in apc-secretion of the inflammatory cytokines il-6 or il-1b. conclusion: we conclude that certain probiotic strains can modify apcs to cause reduced treg activity. this effect apparently depends on a direct apc-to-treg cell contact. the apc-mediated suppressive effect on treg function of certain probiotic strains may constrain the anti-inflammatory activity, which is often desired from probiotic therapy. this unexpected function of certain probiotic strains should be taken into consideration when designing adjuvant therapies with these bacteria, or when probiotic strains are selected for improvement of gut-associated inflammation like ibd.

TI  == effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == ten probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-04, b. lactis type bi-07, howaru l. rhamnosus, and howaru b. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. the various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at ph 2 over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. the permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-cf). the permeability  was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-cf released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log cfu/ml was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. all encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-cf; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. in general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.

TI  == design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  == background & aims: although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the  final design of the probiotic. specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. methods: from a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a  simulated gastrointestinal environment. functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. results: specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.  based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (ecologic 641); bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis. combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of il-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. conclusions: application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.

TI  == selection of probiotic bacteria for prevention of allergic diseases: immunomodulation of neonatal dendritic cells.
AB  == modification of intestinal microbiota early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be a potential approach to prevent allergic disease. to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes, we investigated the capacity of probiotic bacteria to interact with neonatal dendritic cells (dc) and studied the ensuing t cell polarizing effect. immature dc were generated from cord blood-derived monocytes and maturation was induced by maturation factors (mf), lipopolysaccharide (lps) plus mf and bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, lactobacillus salivarius, lactococcus lactis alone or combined with mf. after 12  days of co-culture with dc and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) as antigenic stimulus, cytokine production by autologous t cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. additionally, cells were stimulated with cd3 and cd28 monoclonal antibodies and cytokines were measured in supernatants by multiplex assay. the probiotic strains induced partial maturation of dc. full maturation of dc was induced for all strains tested when mf was added. the percentage of interleukin (il)-4 producing t cells was lower in t cell cultures stimulated with b. bifidum matured dc compared to mf and lps matured dc, which coincided with a higher percentage of interferon (ifn)-gamma-producing t cells. furthermore, t cells stimulated by b. bifidum matured dc produced significantly more il-10 compared to mf matured dc. selected species of the bifidobacterium genus prime in vitro cultured neonatal dc to polarize t cell responses and may therefore be candidates to use in primary prevention of allergic diseases.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
