TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == use of bioinformatics and pcr in the search for abc transporter homology among various bacteria.
AB  == bioinformatics databases and search tools are utilised to produce polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers for the amplification of an abc transporter gene from the clinically important anaerobe finegoldia magna. on sequencing, a 450 base pair amplicon showed homology with the amino acid transporter of enterococcus faecalis. little sequence data is available for f. magna and the newly isolated dna could be a useful tool in the identification of this organism  in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
