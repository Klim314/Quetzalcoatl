TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
