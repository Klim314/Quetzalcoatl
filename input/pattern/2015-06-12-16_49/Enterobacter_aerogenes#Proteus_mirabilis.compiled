TI  - Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Gram-Negative Pathogenic Bacteria Species Isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches are among the medically important pests found within the  human habitations that cause serious public health problems. They may harbor a number of pathogenic bacteria on the external surface with antibiotic resistance. Hence, they are regarded as major microbial vectors. This study investigates the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria species isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India. METHODS: Totally, 203 adult cockroaches were collected form 44 households and 52 food-handling establishments by trapping. Bacteriological examination of external surfaces of Pe. americana and Bl. germanica were carried out using standard method and antibiotics susceptibility profiles of the isolates were determined using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods. RESULTS: Among the places, we found that 54% had cockroache infestation in households and 77% in food- handling establishments. There was no significant different between the overall bacteria load of the external surface in Pe. americana (64.04%) and Bl. germanica (35.96%). However the predominant bacteria on cockroaches were Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, Kl. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were the most prevalent, drug-resistant strains were isolated from the cockroaches with 100% resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin. For individual strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli was found to have multi-resistance to four antibiotic tested, Citrobacter freundii four, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis to three. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches are uniformly distributed in domestic environment, which can be a possible vector for transmission of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne diseases.
TI  - Restrictive reporting of selected antimicrobial susceptibilities influences clinical prescribing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cascade and restrictive reporting are useful strategies to enhance antibiotic stewardship programs. METHODS: We combined both strategies to improve the prescribing of antibiotics aimed at Gram-negative infections. RESULTS: For Enterobacter aerogenes, the susceptibility rates to amikacin increased from 10% to 100%; for third generation cephalosporins, these rates increased from 55% to 89%. The susceptibility rates of E. aerogenes to cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam changed little, and the ampicillin susceptibility decreased from 30% in 2009 to 11% in 2010. For Proteus mirabilis, the susceptibility rates increased for third-generation cephalosporins (48% vs. 92%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (10% vs. 98%), with minimal changes for cefepime (96% vs. 93%), ampicillin (69% vs. 73%) and amikacin (96% vs. 84%). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates improved slightly for third-generation cephalosporins (81% vs. 91%) but reduced for piperacillin-tazobactam (99% vs. 59%). Hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infections decreased from 0.11 to 0.07 per 1000 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: Selective reporting helps physicians choose the most appropriate antibiotics for their patients within a stewardship program, with reduced C. difficile infection.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of extracts of the bark of Melia azedarach (China Berry).
AB  - Nature provides a variety of drugs and medicinal agents derived from plants. This study was conducted to determine antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of extracts of Melia azedarach bark with methanol/water (9:1 v/v), chloroform, butanol, hexane, water and ethyl acetate. For the determination of the antimicrobial activities, the agar well diffusion method was employed. Cytotoxicity was studied by brine shrimp lethality assay; antioxidant activities were measured using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. The chloroform extract was active against Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis, the ethyl acetate extract had highest antibacterial spectrum against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the n-hexane extract had highest inhibition against E. aerogenes, the aqueous extract showed highest activities against P. mirabilis, the butanol fraction showed highest activities against E. aerogenes and the methanolic extract was highly active against P. mirabilis.
TI  - Infected hydatid cysts bacteria in slaughtered livestock and their effects on protoscoleces degeneration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protoscoleces of fertile hydatid cysts are considered as major risks in surgery and producing secondary cysts if rupture the cyst during operation and, cause infecting the dogs with adult worm if eaten by this animal. Bacterial infection of the hydatid fluid can lead to sterilization of the cyst. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial infection rate of livestock hydatid cysts in Hamedan, Iran, and test the isolated bacteria effects on viable protoscoleces, in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 5709 slaughtered livestock were inspected to detect the presence of hydatid cysts. The hydatid fluid of all cysts was cultured separately to isolate and identify the bacteria. The effect of isolated bacteria was tested on viable protoscoleces in culture tubes, in vitro. The culture tubes were observed and examined under a light microscope every two hours for 24 hours, and then, after 36 and 48 hours. RESULTS: Infected cysts were found in 74% of animals in Hamedan (46% were calcified and the bacteria was isolated from 52%) and 62% in Borujerd. The isolated bacteria in the infected cysts were as follows: Escherichia coli, E. blattae, Klebsiella pnoumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Edwardsiella tarda. The protoscoleces incubated with the isolated bacteria totally degenerated, but 55% of the protoscoleces in the control groups were intact and viable even after one week. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a high percentage of cysts bacterial infections in two provinces of Iran. The common isolated bacteria were E. coli and Klebsiella. The isolated bacteria degenerated the protoscoleces during short-time incubation, in vitro.
TI  - The preliminary assessment of anti-microbial activity of HPLC separated components of Kirkia wilmsii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most communities in developing countries rely on traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases. In South Africa, the Limpopo province, within the Lebowakgomo district, uses tuberous roots of Kirkia wilmsii, after infusion in water for the treatment of a wide range of diseases by Sotho communities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main objective of the study was to assess the anti-microbial activity of separated aqueous components of the Kirkia wilmsii tuberous roots. The clear aqueous extracts that were obtained after a 0.45 microm membrane filtration (Millipore Millex-HV Hydrophillic PVDF filter), were then injected into a preparative high performance liquid chromatography instrument in which pure components, as shown by peaks, were collected and evaluated for anti-microbial activity against a range of microorganisms. RESULTS: The eight separated components were obtained, out of which four components showed anti-microbial activity (AMA). The freeze dried components were re-dissolved in deionised water and then evaluated for AMA against Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Enterobacter aerogenes. Component one exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), of 3.445 mg/ml. Component five was only active against Proteus mirabilis with a MIC of 0.08 mg/ml. Component 7, was active against Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with a MIC of 0.365 mg/ml against both Shigella dysenteriae and Staphylococcus aureus and 0.091 mg/ml against Escherichia coli. Component 8, was active against Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Salmonella, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli with a MIC of 155 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Only four out of eight aqueous extracts showed AMA against both gram negative and positive bacteria and showed no AMA against Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes and Vibrio cholerae. Therefore the Kirkia wilmsii plant root may be used as a broad spectrum antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in North America 2010-2011.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. This report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in North America in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) identified in ESBL-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. The incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. Characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(AmpC), and bla(KPC) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Avibactam reverts the ceftazidime MIC90 of European Gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. The effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime MIC frequency distribution of Gram-negative European clinical isolates was observed and compared to European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) listed for ceftazidime. METHODS: Ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam MICs were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference broth microdilution methods for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in Europe during 2009. RESULTS: The MIC(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against P. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 European surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. That is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for P. aeruginosa to the ECOFF. Similarly, the MIC(90) values for ceftazidime against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and P. mirabilis were also reduced to the ECOFF by the presence of avibactam. Avibactam reduced the ceftazidime MIC(90) value against collected Enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). No ECOFF has been defined for Enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for Gram-negative bacteria to the ECOFF.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region: results of the study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Asia-Pacific region were investigated. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. A total of 699 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with positive genotypic results, included Escherichia coli (n = 443), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), Morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of Enterobacter asburiae, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri were analyzed. Nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated IAI. CTX-M (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with CTX-M-15) was the most common ESBL, followed by SHV (n = 59) and TEM (n = 4). CMY (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with CMY-2) was the most common AmpC beta-lactamase, followed by DHA (n = 46) and ACT/MIR (n = 40). NDM (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with NDM-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by IMP (n = 7) and OXA (n = 7). Isolates from hospital-associated IAI had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. Carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from India, except that IMP beta-lactamases were also detected in Philippines and Australia. CTX-M beta-lactamases were the predominant ESBLs produced by Enterobacteriaceae causing IAI in the Asia-Pacific region. Emergence of CTX-M-15-, CMY-2-, and NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.
TI  - Urinary tract infection among symptomatic outpatients visiting a tertiary hospital based in midwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Microbial pathogens implicated in urinary tract infection and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as prevalent in UTI symptomatic outpatients resident in Benin City, Nigeria was the focus of this study. One hundred (100) midstream urine samples were collected into sterile plastic universal bottles from outpatients who visited the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria and who were tentatively diagnosed as manifesting symptoms of UTI. Patients were referred to the Medical Microbiology department by the consulting doctors. Significant bacterial counts and neutrophil (pus cells) counts were carried out on samples by standard methods. Positive samples for both counts were inoculated aseptically on sterile MacConkey agar, Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient (CLED) agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar plates and incubated appropriately. Microbial isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out on isolates by standard methods. Thirty nine (39.0%) and 61 (61.0%) samples recorded significant microbial growth and no growth respectively. Gram negative bacilli constituted 86.1% (of which enterobacteriaceae made up 49.9%) while gram positive cocci made up 13.9%. Strains of uropathogens isolated were Alcaligenes spp (19.4%), Klebsiella aerogenes (16.7%), Escherichia coli (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.9%), Candida albicans (11.1%), Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Enterobacter spp (5.5%) and Providencia spp (5.5%). Occurrence of UTI in male and female patients were 58.3% and 41.7% respectively of which UTI occurred highest in the 25-46, 15-54 and 27-54 age groups in that decreasing order. Alcaligenes spp occurred most in very old female patients. Candida albicans (the only fungal uropathogen) occurred in an 8day old male patient. Other isolates occurred in much older patients. A significantly high microscopic neutrophil count or pyuria was recorded from deposits of UTI positive patients (i.e. &lt; 5/HPF). Eighteen (representing 50.5%) and 15 (47.8%) of total microbial strains isolated were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility profile also showed 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%) for ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and ofloxacin respectively suggesting moderate sensitivity of the fluoroquinolones and second/third generation cephalosporins. Gentamicin, ampicillin and augmentin recorded over 70.0% resistance level each. A total of nineteen bacterial strains made of E.coli, Enterobacter spp, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp, Staph. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi drug resistant as they resisted 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 and 8 antibiotics respectively.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Dissemination of the rmtB gene carried on IncF and IncN plasmids among Enterobacteriaceae in a pig farm and its environment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characterization of 16S rRNA methylase-producing bacteria in a pig farm and its environment in East China. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae isolates and metagenomic DNA from 102 pig faecal samples from a pig farm and 97 soil samples taken in or around the farm were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA methylase genes. The clonal relationships of 16S rRNA methylase-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized. RESULTS: Fifty-six rmtB-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including 54 Escherichia coli, 1 Morganella morganii and 1 Proteus mirabilis, were recovered from 55 pig faecal samples. Nineteen rmtB-positive bacteria, including 13 E. coli, 2 M. morganii, 2 Leclercia adecarboxylata, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 Enterobacter cloacae, were recovered from 16 soil samples. Among the 75 rmtB-positive isolates, 31 and 25 also carried the qepA and bla(CTX-M) genes, respectively. The qepA gene co-localized with rmtB on the F2:A-:B1 plasmids and the bla(CTX-M-65) gene co-localized with rmtB on the F33:A-:B- plasmids. The rmtB gene was also found to be associated with the IncN plasmids. Clonal transmission of rmtB-positive E. coli isolates was observed between different pig groups and soil samples. CONCLUSIONS: Both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread could be responsible for the dissemination of the rmtB gene in the pig farm and its environment. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of rmtB-positive bacteria from farmland soils and indicates that these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes could be acquired by humans through the food chain.
TI  - Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Bignoniaceae) as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - This study evaluated, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of the hexane extract  (JCHE), methanol extract (JCME), and chloroform fraction (JCCF) of bark from Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Family Bignoniaceae), a Brazilian medicinal plant, traditionally used as anti-syphilis and anti-gonorrhea treatment. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion method followed by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. JCHE was not active against the bacteria evaluated. JCME presented antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 16.3 mg/mL, 9.1 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. JCCF was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, S. pyogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and N. gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 18.3 mg/mL, 9.3 mg/mL, 6.3 mg/mL, 6.1 mg/mL, 9.2 mg/mL, 6.2 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. Phytochemical analysis of JCME and JCCF gave positive results for saponins, coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, quinones, alkaloids, triterpenes, and steroids. Verbascoside was isolated and identified as a major peak in JCME and JCCF high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and might contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in Lebanese patients.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We conducted a study of 32 Lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. Polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. The presence or absence of S aureus enterotoxin A, B, C, and D (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. Biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. A total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. Of these, only 3 (8.8%) were S aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin B). Moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. Our results could not confirm that S aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the Lebanese group studied.
TI  - Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Proteus
AB  - The Gram-negative bacilli of the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter,and Proteus(Table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. With the exception of Proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. Many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. Today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. A limited number of species, including E coli, K pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, S marcescens,and P mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. The increasing incidence of the coliforms, Proteus, and other Gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (R factors). Also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host defenses.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a phospholipase A2 from the venom of the Saw-scaled viper: Novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  - Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. In this study, a basic myotoxic PLA(2), named EcTx-I was isolated from Echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on Superdex G-75, and reverse phase HPLC on C18 and C8 Sepharose columns. PLA(2), EcTx-I was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by MALDI-TOF (15 kD by SDS-PAGE), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. The N-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic PLA(2)s from other snake venoms. The purified PLA(2) EcTx-I was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW&TES), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. EcTx-I showed strong antibacterial activity against B. pseudomallei (KHW) and E. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. Other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. However, the Gram-positive bacterium E. aerogenes failed to show any effect on EcTx-I protein at tested doses. The most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of EcTx-I was observed at MICs of >15 mug/ml against (B. pseudomallei, KHW) and MICs >30 mug/ml against E. aerogenes. Mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. EcTx-I was able to induce cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in BALB/c mice. EcTx-I also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. It is shown that the toxic effect induced by E. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic PLA(2) (EcTx-I). The result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. In conclusion, EcTx-I displays a heparin binding C-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.
TI  - [Clinical assessment of novel ChromID ESBL agar plates for detection of ESBL producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. ChromID ESBL agar newly developed for screening ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was released in Japan in April, 2007. We evaluated the clinical assessment of ChromID ESBL agar in routine microbiology laboratory. The 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae with the MICs of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. The 27 ESBL-producers examined were comprising of 19 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 S. marcescens (ESBL group) and 20 ESBL non-producers consiating of 5 K. oxytoca, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 P. vlugaris, 2 Serratia marcescens, 8 C. freundii, 2 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 E. aerogenes (non-ESBL group). Characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. As the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of ChromID ESBL agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. It should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. These findings clearly suggested that in cases of utilizing ChromID ESBL agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the ESBL-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to CPDX.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Transfer of a phage T4 gene into Enterobacteriaceae, determined at the single-cell level.
AB  - The transfer range of phage genes was investigated at the single-cell level by using an in situ DNA amplification technique. After absorption of phages, a phage T4 gene was maintained in the genomes of non-plaque-forming bacteria at frequencies of 10(-2) gene copies per cell. The gene transfer decreased the mutation frequencies in nonhost recipients.
TI  - International spread and persistence of TEM-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an IncA/C2 plasmid containing Tn1696::Tn1 and IS5075-Tn21.
AB  - TEM-24 remains one of the most widespread TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae. To analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative TEM-24 producers from Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain (13 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 Escherichia coli isolates, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 Proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). Clonal relatedness (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and E. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. Plasmid analysis included determination of the incompatibility group (by PCR, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (Tn3, Tn21, and Tn402). Similar PFGE patterns were identified among E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, while E. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups A, B2, and D). Highly related 180-kb IncA/C2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. Each plasmid contained defective In0-Tn402 (dfrA1-aadA1, aacA4, or aacA4-aacC1-orfE-aadA2-cmlA1) and In4-Tn402 (aacA4 or dfrA1-aadA1) variants. These integrons were located within Tn21, Tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with IS5075 interrupting their IRtnp and IRmer. In all cases, blaTEM-24 was part of an IS5075-DeltaTn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blaTEM-2 and blaTEM-3 variants. The international dissemination of TEM-24 is fuelled by an IncA/C2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. This work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of TEM-2 ESBL derivatives.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - SUMMARY: AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).
TI  - [Recent evolution and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria in the CHU of Nice (2005-2007)].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: ESBL producing enterobacteria (E-ESBL+) are always a public health concern, mainly due to increase of CTX-M beta-lactamase. So, 542 new strains were isolated in the CHU de Nice during the 2005-2007 period. The aim of this work was to characterize the ESBL and to type isolates suspected to be implicated in outbreaks. METHODS: Every first E-ESBL+ was studied, the antibiotype was defined by the agar diffusion technique. Type of ESBL was determined by PCR, followed by sequencing for CTX-M and SHV enzymes. Typing was performed when several strains of one species had same antibiotype and beta-lactamase. RESULTS: CTX-M type ESBL are predominant (45% of all E-ESBL+), mainly in Escherichia coli (34.5%). The TEM24 ESBL was the second predominant type (34.5%), mainly in Enterobacter aerogenes (18.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.4%). SHV5/12 ESBL was found mainly in Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%). Several epidemic situations were identified, with CTX-M15 in Escherichia coli (2005/2006: 27 patients), SHV5/12 in Enterobacter cloacae (2006: 10 patients) and TEM in Proteus mirabilis (2007: nine patients). Enterobacter aerogenes is still endemic (101 patients) while an epidemic clone of TEM24 producing K. pneumoniae persists especially in an intensive care unit (26 patients during the three years). CONCLUSION: Caracterization of E-ESBL+ is essential to better understand their mode of dissemination, monitor the emergence of new enzymes and adapt the efforts against BMR cross transmission.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Viper metalloproteinase (Agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. A 23.1 kDa protein was isolated from Agkistrodon halys (pallas, Chinese viper) snake venom. The toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an N-terminal sequence (MIQVLLVTICLAVFPYQGSSIILES) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the Viperidae family. The antibacterial effect of Agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (AHM) on Burkholderia pseudomallei (strains TES and KHW), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microM. Interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against S. aureus, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant B. pseudomallei (strain KHW) bacteria. AHM variants with high bacteriostatic activity (MIC 1.875-60 microM) also tended to be less cytotoxic against U-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mM concentrations. These results suggest that this metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.
TI  - Detection of HIV-1 sequences in intestinal bacteria of HIV/AIDS patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial DNA isolated from the intestinal tract of 11 American and 30 Slovak HIV/AIDS patients were analyzed by colony and dot blot hybridization assay for HIV-1 specific sequences. Secondly, PCR using primers specific for the HIV-1 gag, pol and env genes for detection of HIV-1 sequences in these DNA were performed. RESULTS: Intestinal bacteria DNA of HIV/AIDS patients hybridized in colony and dot blot hybridization assay for HIV-1 specific sequences. PCR products synthesized on specific primers of HIV-1 gag (115 bp), env (142 bp), pol-env (1484) genes were found to be for more than 90% homologous to the corresponding sequence in HIV-1. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal bacteria of HIV/AIDS patients are bearing sequences for more than 90% identical with those of HIV-1.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase A2 enzymes.
AB  - AIMS: Venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified PLA(2)s and two L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). Several snake venoms (Daboia russelli russelli, Crotalus adamanteus, Naja sumatrana, Pseudechis guttata, Agkistrodon halys, Acanthophis praelongus and Daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. Daboia russelli russelli and Pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. The order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -S. aureus > Proteus mirabilis > Proteus vulgaris > Enterobacter aerogenes > Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against S. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). A stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). The MIC were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that viperidae (D. russelli russelli) and elapidae (P. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the PLA(2) enzymes. The results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The activity of LAAO and PLA(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of some pharmaceutical products marketed by drug vendors  in Uyo, Nigeria.
AB  - Bacteriological quality of some pharmaceutical products purchased from open markets, buses and drug stores in Uyo metropolis was studied in order to determine the level of contamination of the drugs. The drug samples examined were Tetracycline capsules, Paracetamol tablets, Ampicillin capsules, Chloroquine tablets, Chloroquine syrup, Chloroquine injections, Flagyl tablets and Chloramphenicol tablets. The bacterial count ranged from 2.3x10(4) cfu/g to 4.4x10(4) cfu/g for the 16 samples of Ampicillin, 1.2x10(5) cfu/g to 1.8x10 (4) cfu/g for the 7 samples of unsealed capsules of tetratcycline, 2.9x10(4) cfu/g to 3.8 x10(4) cfu/g for the 15 samples of paracetamol, 3.8 x10(4) cfu/ml to 2.0 x10(4) cfu/ml for the 23 samples of Chloroquine injection, tablets and syrup 1.0 x10(4) cfu/g to 4.8 x10(4) cfu/g for 15 samples of Flagyl. The organisms isolated were Bacillus subtilis (19.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.0%), Aerobacter aerogenes (7.0%) and Proteus mirabilis (8.0%). Although the counts obtained from this work were of low levels, the presence of known pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis in some drugs constitute a health hazard to the public.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  - Three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), the VITEK 2 System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the MicroScan WalkAway-96 System (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA), using routine testing panels. One hundred fifty putative ESBL producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. Conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the CLSI double-disk synergy test, and the Etest ESBL were also evaluated. Biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. One hundred forty-seven isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii were investigated. Of these isolates, 85 were identified as ESBL producers by the reference method. The remaining isolates were identified as non-ESBL producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal AmpC, Koxy, or SHV enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. The system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of ESBLs was the Phoenix (99%), followed by the VITEK 2 (86%) and the MicroScan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (Phoenix) to 78% (VITEK 2). The performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. The sensitivities of the conventional test methods ranged from 93 to 94%. The double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.
TI  - Emerging bacterial pathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates harbouring the same transferable plasmid coding for metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-1 in Greece.
AB  
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - Spread of novel expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae in a university hospital in the Paris area, France.
AB  - In 2002, 28 non-duplicate enterobacterial isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were collected from infected patients at the Bicetre Hospital in Paris, France. Escherichia coli was the predominant ESBL-positive enterobacterial species, comprising ten (36%) of the isolates. CTX-M enzymes (CTX-M-3, CTX-M-10, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15) were produced by 11 (39%) of the isolates (six E. coli, two Enterobacter cloacae, one Enterobacter aerogenes, one Proteus mirabilis and one Citrobacter freundii). Other ESBLs, such as VEB-1 and PER-1, were also detected, but less frequently.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Evaluation of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the performance of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of various species. METHODS: Organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains comprising Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae (10), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) and Proteus mirabilis (4). Also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking ESBLs, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of AmpC enzyme in Citrobacter freundii (2), E. aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (3), E. coli (4), Hafnia alvei (1) and Morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in K. pneumoniae (3) and E. coli (3) or hyperproduction of K1 enzyme in K. oxytoca (6). RESULTS: The MicroScan MIC-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 ESBL strains as ESBL-positive and 23 of 30 non-ESBL strains as ESBL-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). False negatives among ESBL producers were highest with Enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. False-positive classifications occurred in two Acinetobacter spp., one E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase and two K. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: The MicroScan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for ESBL confirmation. However, this test has limitations in detecting ESBLs in Enterobacter spp. and in discriminating ESBL-related resistance from the K1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - Frequency and diversity of Class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in hospitals of the Auvergne, France: a 2 year prospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) produced by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one French region. METHODS: During 2001-2002, all the non-duplicate isolates of P. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and of Enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime and/or aminoglycosides with an AAC(6') I phenotype were collected in nine hospitals of the area. ESBL isoelectric points were determined, bla genes were amplified and sequenced and epidemic isolates were genotyped with ERIC2-PCR. RESULTS: ESBLs were observed in 297 Enterobacteriaceae (0.8%). The most frequent were TEM-3 like (n=152; 51.2%) and TEM-24 (n=115; 38.7%). Four new enzymes were observed, TEM-112 (pI 5.4), TEM-113 (pI 6.3), TEM-114 (pI 5.9) and TEM-126 (pI 5.4). Other TEMs were TEM-8, TEM-12, TEM-16, TEM-19, TEM-20, TEM-21, TEM-29 and TEM-71. The other ESBLs were SHV-4, SHV-5 and SHV-12, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15. In 37 P. aeruginosa (0.7%) only one ESBL was observed, PER-1. Five epidemic strains were detected, Serratia marcescens TEM-3 and four observed in several hospitals, Enterobacter aerogenes TEM-24, Citrobacter koseri TEM-3, Proteus mirabilis TEM-3 and P. aeruginosa PER-1. CONCLUSION: ESBL frequency was lower than in 1998, and CTX-M-type frequency higher (2.1% of ESBLs in 2001, 4.9% in 2002). This long-term survey detected new sporadic enzymes (TEM-112, TEM-113, TEM-114 and TEM-126) and interhospital epidemic strains while avoiding any overestimation of ESBL frequency that may otherwise have occurred because of acute epidemics.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new ESBL Etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate ESBL Etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: Enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Proteus mirabilis (n=3). To check Etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to ESBL, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of K. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. RESULTS: With this panel, ESBL Etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. Concentrating on Enterobacter spp., reliable ESBL detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed ESBL production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of Enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. A limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with K1 phenotypes of K. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by Etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. CONCLUSION: The new Etest ESBL strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to current methods for detection of ESBLs. In our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of ESBLs, particularly in Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Molecular details of urease inhibition by boric acid: insights into the catalytic mechanism.
AB  - The structure of the complex of urease, a Ni-containing metalloenzyme, with boric acid was determined at 2.10 A resolution. The complex shows the unprecedented binding mode of the competitive inhibitor to the dinuclear metal center, with the B(OH)3 molecule bridging the Ni ions and leaving in place the bridging hydroxide. Boric acid can be considered a substrate analogue of urea, and the structure supports the proposal that the Ni-bridging hydroxide acts as the nucleophile in the enzymatic process of urea hydrolysis.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  - In 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the Aquitaine region in France produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Among these were 19 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 Escherichia coli isolates; 3 Proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Providencia stuartii. ESBL producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes and 5 ambulatory patients. Seven different ESBLs were characterized. These mainly consisted of TEM-24 (25 isolates) and TEM-21 (9 isolates), but TEM-15 (2 isolates) and TEM-3, TEM-19, SHV-4, and CTX-M-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. Seven strains showed the coexistence of different TEM- and/or SHV-encoding genes, including a new SHV-1 variant, SHV-44, defined by the substitution R205L previously reported for SHV-3 in association with S238G. The epidemiology of the ESBL producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the ESBL, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the ESBL-encoding plasmids. Of the TEM-24-expressing strains, 18 were E. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in France. Of the TEM-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. Outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. The presence of ESBL producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. Our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in general practice.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: All patients admitted to a 31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. RESULTS: Of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. The lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. The main resistant microorganisms were Enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Enterobacter cloacae. The main susceptible microorganisms were Enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and Proteus mirabilis. Patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). The maximum degrees of organ failure during the ICU stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. Multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is not an independent predictor for death. The development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the ICU length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four European countries, Canada, and the United States in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  - Access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. The present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), Canada, and the United States to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. All but two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of Proteus mirabilis from France and one isolate of Morganella morganii from Canada) were susceptible to imipenem. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for P. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except Italy. In contrast, susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (Spain) to 94.0% (France); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (Spain) to 91.6% (United States). Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. Considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of Serratia marcescens and M. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. For S. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (France) to 94.1% (Italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (Germany) to 90.7% (Spain). Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of Enterobacteriaceae studied. The present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in Buenos Aires, Argentina, public hospitals.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). In order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of ESBLs in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from April to May 2000. Extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. From a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' Screening and Confirmatory Tests for ESBL production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-Lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and PCR amplification using specific primers. Three different ESBLs were detected: SHV-related (4 isolates), PER-2-type (9 isolates), and CTX-M-2-related (26 isolates). Sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed CTX-M-2 in 19 of 21 and CTX-M-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. CTX-M-2 (or its variant) was detected in all Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii strains, while PER-2 was detected in Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; SHV-related ESBL were found only in K. pneumoniae. These results clearly show that CTX-M-2 is the most prevalent ESBL produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in Buenos Aires.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waaE gene: function and genetic distribution among some Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - To determine the function of the waaE gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  LPS of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a waaE non-polar mutant has been constructed. Data obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of LPS samples obtained from the wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waaE gene is involved in substitution of alpha-L-glycero-D-manno-heptopyranose I (L,D-HeppI) at the O-4 position by a beta-D-glucopyranose (beta-D-Glcp) residue. In addition, DNA amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waaE homologues located between the waaA and coaD genes are present in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-L,D-HeppI (K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes of unknown LPS-core structures. Complementation studies using non-polar waaE mutants prove that all the waaE homologues perform the same function. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae, Ser. marcescens and P. mirabilis non-polar waaE mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. In addition, the Ser. marcescens and P. murabilis waaE mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. All these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waaE gene independently of its origin. An easy DNA amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-L,D-HeppI] in the inner-core LPS of Enterobacteriaceae members with unknown LPS-core structures.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae: an Italian survey.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. A total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten Italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated ESBL producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated ESBL producer, followed by K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). However, amongst all ESBL producers, K. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by P. mirabilis (25.7%). All the strains positive to DD tests were confirmed for the carriage of TEM and SHV genes using colony-blot hybridisation (CH). A total of 447 strains (88.0%) were CH-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the TEM-type probe, 30.1% with the SHV-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested produced ESBLs, 42.3% of which were TEM-derived enzymes. More than 20% of P. stuartii, K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. The double-disk test seems to be a useful test to identify ESBL producing strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  - Utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  Enterobacteriaceae. The results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the members of these species. The genomic hybridization of selected Enterobacteriaceae members with the Escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in Shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to E. coli. However, the Salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglR and bglG regions and the deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. Similarly, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglR and bglG regions and deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. The homolog of the cel operon could be identified in S. sonnei and Salmonella groups of organisms. Possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.
TI  - Evidence of in vivo transfer of a plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 and other resistance factors among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The epidemiological study of several multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from five patients demonstrated in vivo dissemination of a 100-kb plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 from a clonal strain of Enterobacter aerogenes to different strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during October-December, 1999 was tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. METHODS: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli 87, Klebsiella pneumoniae 54, Pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, Staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant S. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive S. aureus 12), Acinetobacter species 26, Enterobacter aerogenes 9, Proteus mirabilis 5, Proteus vulgaris 2, and Citrobacter species 3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using NCCLS guidelines. The cut-off values of isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. RESULTS: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. Isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the other aminoglycosides tested. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - A novel CTX-M beta-lactamase (CTX-M-8) in cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Brazil.
AB  - To estimate the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Brazil, 18 strains from different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae exhibiting a positive double-disk synergy test were collected by a clinical laboratory from several hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1996 and 1997. Four strains (Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter amalonaticus) hybridized with a 550-bp CTX-M probe. The P. mirabilis strain produced a CTX-M-2 enzyme. The E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and C. amalonaticus isolates harbored a bla gene which was identified by cloning and sequencing as a bla(CTX-M) gene. E. coli HB101 transconjugants and the E. coli DH5alpha transformant harboring a recombinant plasmid produced a CTX-M beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 7.6 conferring a resistance phenotype characterized by a higher level of resistance to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime, as observed with the other CTX-M enzymes. The deduced protein sequence showed a novel Ambler class A CTX-M enzyme, named CTX-M-8, which had 83 to 88% identity with the previously described CTX-M enzymes. The phylogenic study of the CTX-M family including CTX-M-8 revealed four CTX-M types, CTX-M-8 being the first member of a new phylum of CTX-M enzymes. The evolutionary distances between the four types of CTX-M were large, suggesting that the four clusters branched off early from a distant unknown enzyme and that intermediate enzymes probably existed.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Production of a TEM-24 plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Several Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, including one urinary isolate producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24, were isolated from a long-term-hospitalized woman. Three TEM-24-producing enterobacterial species (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were isolated from the same patient. TEM-24 and the resistance markers for aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamide were encoded by a 180-kb plasmid transferred by conjugation into E. coli HB101.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - Comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of Australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  - To compare the antibacterial activity of the Australian tea tree oil (TTO) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by GC-MS and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The highest activity was obtained by TTO, with MIC values of 0.25% for Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and S. xylosus. It is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than TTO against gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.12%. Both TTO and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded ampC-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis (CF09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated MIC of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. Two beta-lactamases with apparent pIs of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. Substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase with a pI of 9.0. Amplification by PCR with primers for ampC genes (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii) of a 756-bp DNA fragment from strain CF09 was obtained only with C. freundii-specific primers. Hybridization results showed that the ampC gene is only chromosomally located while the TEM gene is plasmid located. After cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that this ampC gene is close to blaCMY-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions Glu --> Gly at position 22, Trp --> Arg at position 201, and Ser --> Asn at position 343. AmpC beta-lactamases derived from that of C. freundii (LAT-1, LAT-2, BIL-1, and CMY-2) have been found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. This is the first example of a chromosomally encoded AmpC-type beta-lactamase observed in P. mirabilis. We suggest that it be designated CMY-3.
TI  - Identification of a common structural motif in the disordered N-terminal region of bacterial flagellins--evidence for a new class of fibril-forming peptides.
AB  - Flagellin proteins lacking the N- or C-terminus form polymers of reduced filament stability and straight morphology, in contrast to the coiled native flagella. In the present study, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of flagellins of the anaerobic beer spoilage bacteria Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus and Pectinatus frisingiensis as well as Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas sp. were determined. Sequence similarity was revealed between these and the N-termini of all known eubacterial flagellins. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 15 amino acid residues of the flagellins of Pectinatus, Campylobacter jejuni, E. aerogenes or Proteus mirabilis flagellins had a spontaneous tendency under physiological conditions to form 4-6 nm broad, 1-2 microm long fibrillar structures that had a tendency to form clusters. In contrast, the Pectinatus peptide missing residues 1-3 did not form fibrils. The peptide missing residues 13-15 formed fibrils less easily, and the peptide missing residues 11-15 formed fibrils almost without clustering. In electron micrographs, the fibrillisation of the bacterial flagellar peptides resembled that of beta-amyloid and prion peptides. 1H-NMR and infrared spectroscopy studies with homology analysis indicate that although the flagellar N-terminal peptides are flexible with many conformational minima, they have a significant tendency to form beta-type structures and a loop in the middle of the peptide. The hydrophobic character of the N-terminus together with the property of forming a conserved beta-strand-loop-beta-strand motif may be related to a mechanism involved in attaining the proper morphology and stability of the flagellar filament, by providing a device for facilitating the attachment of the flagellin monomers to each other. The flagellar peptides represent a new class of fibril-forming peptides.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - [Study of in vitro activity of 3 cephalosporins and their combination with 2 beta-lactamase inhibitors against 4 enterobacteria strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefotaxime, cefepime and cefpirome was evaluated alone and in association with two beta-lactamase inhibitors: clavulanic acid and sulbactam against 65 extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae strains [Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Proteus mirabilis (9), Escherichia coli (11), Enterobacter aerogenes (10)]. The lowest MICs were observed for cefepime and cefpirome used alone. In association with inhibitors cefotaxime was less effective against E. aerogenes. Most isolates of K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli were susceptible to all the different tested associations.
TI  - The responses of Lucilia cuprina to odours from sheep, offal and bacterial cultures.
AB  - The responses of gravid female Lucilia cuprina to odours from sheep urine, faeces and gut mucus, and to odours from liver/sodium sulphide mixtures was tested using a bioassay which measured the movement and probing response of walking flies. The same bioassay was used to test the response to odours from cultures of bacteria isolated from liver/sodium sulphide and liver/water mixtures. A significant movement towards odours from faeces, gut mucus and urine was observed. Odours from cultures of the bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Dermatophilus congolensis and Serratia marcescens also elicited significant movement. A probing response was elicited by odours from gut mucus, fresh urine, liver/sodium sulphide mixtures and cultures of P.mirabilis, D.congolensis and gram-positive species. Odours from cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii did not elicit significant movement or probing. The movement and probing responses are discussed with reference to the possible uses of the substances tested as a bait for attracting L.cuprina.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefetamet against clinical isolates from urinary tract infection].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefetamet (CEMT), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CEMT and control drugs were determined against Gram-negative rods mainly from complicated urinary tract infections examined in our laboratory from April to September of 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The obtained strains were Citrobacter diversus 20, Citrobacter freundii 30, Enterobacter aerogenes 20, Enterobacter cloacae 30, Serratia marcescens 30, Proteus mirabilis 30, Proteus vulgaris 20 and Morganella morganii 30 strains, a total of 210 strains. 2. Excluding some resistant strains, the MIC-distribution showed showed that CEMT had strong antimicrobial activities against those strains from the MIC-distribution of this investigation. Compared to reports on CEMT in 1989, the MIC80 of CEMT in this investigation against clinical isolates were similar. The MIC50's of CEMT against E. aerogenes, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and M. morganii in the previous examination were equal to or similar to the current results, but the MIC50's against C. freundii and E. cloacae were lower than the value of this report. The detection frequency of highly resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae to cefteram and cefixime were similar to that of CEMT-resistant strains. Multiple drug resistant strains, among these bacterial species seemed to be increasing. 3. Compared to oral antibacterial agents of oxime cephems that were used in the past, CEMT showed higher peak values of urinary excretion concentration and higher blood levels were sustained for a longer period of time. CEMT-PI will be effective against urinary tract infections.
TI  - Survey of prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - During the first six months of 1990 and 1994 respectively, 3179 and 2721 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated at the teaching hospital of Clermont-Ferrand. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found in 147 isolates, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 37) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 15). TEM-3/CTX-1, SHV-4/CAZ-5 and TEM-24/CAZ-6 were the prevalent enzymes. However, the most frequently involved enzyme in 1990 was TEM-3 (48.6%) whereas in 1994 it was SHV-4 (56.0%). Two salient features emerged from this study: the high frequency of TEM-3 production in P. mirabilis and the production of SHV-4 enzyme, heretofore observed solely in K. pneumoniae, in two other species, E. aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Degradation of propanil by bacterial isolates and mixed populations from a pristine lake.
AB  - The microbial transformation rates of propanil, a commonly used herbicide, were investigated using water from a pristine lake in northeast Georgia. Microbial degradation rates were measured using natural water microflora, the natural water microflora amended with five bacterial species (Aerobacter aerogenes, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Proteus mirabilis, and Aeromonas salmonicida) isolated from the same lake, and the five isolates individually. Transformation rate constants for propanil were compared for the mixed microbial assemblages and isolates at similar initial bacterial concentrations (approximately 5.0 x 10(-3) bacteria/mL). Degradation started within 60 hours and was completed by 160 hours in all experiments. The mean first-order rate constant for natural microflora was -(4.80 +/- 0.620) x 10(-3) h-1. Natural waters amended with the bacterial isolates yielded rate constants ranging from -(0.39 +/- 0.186) x 10(-3) h-1 to -(2.13 +/- 0.029) x 10(-3) h-1 with an overall mean of -(1.63 +/- 0.242) x 10(-3) h-1. After 660 hours following the first amendment of propanil, (i.e., 500 hours after propanil degradation was complete), each sample was again amended with propanil. Subsequent degradation rates ranged from -(21.3 +/- 0.186) x 10(-3) h-1 to -(64.2 +/- 0.786) x 10(-3) h-1 and the mean rate constant was -(37.5 +/- 0.922) x 10(-3) h-1. No significant differences were observed between first-order rate constants among isolates following the first or the second addition of propanil. After the second spike, however, the average of rate constants was approximately 20 times greater than that following the first spike. Rates for the individual isolates varied greatly from one isolate to another, ranging from virtually no degradation with A. calcoaceticus to -(21.6 +/- 0.332) x 10(-3) h-1 for the composite treatment of all isolates.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Evaluation of RapID onE system for identification of 379 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  - The ability of the RapID onE system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Norcross, Ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. Kits were inoculated with no. 2 McFarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. Overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas and non-Shigella sonnei Shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional tests. For four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included one Serratia liquefaciens (Serratia marcescens or Serratia liquefaciens), one Serratia rubidaea (Serratia rubidaea or Serratia odorifera), one Salmonella typhi (Leminorella richardii or Salmonella sp.) and one Yersinia enterocolitica (Yersinia frederiksenii, Yersinia intermedia, or Yersinia enterocolitica). Twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these comprised one Citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three Enterobacter hormaechei (not in the RapID onE database; two Enterobacter amnigenus, one Enterobacter sp.), one Serratia liquefaciens (Enterobacter cloacae), one Serratia rubidaea (no identification), four Serratia fonticola (not in RapID onE database; two Enterobacter aerogenes, one Serratia marcescens, one not identified), one Proteus mirabilis (Proteus penneri), and one Proteus vulgaris (Providencia rustigianii). If the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. The RapID onE system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the Royal London Hospital.
AB  - beta-Lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. This survey, performed between January and April, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. The distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. This increase was balanced by a decreased proportion of enterobacteria. Amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (especially), TEM-2, SHV-1 and OXA types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. Their frequency in Escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst Proteus mirabilis isolates. An apparent decrease in their frequency amongst Enterobacter cloacae isolates, from 48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. Plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of P. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. In the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of E. cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii, and in 2/170 P. aeruginosa isolates. These proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (P approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). Extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were found in 11/70 Klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. Ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced TEM-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified SHV-derived enzyme.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyrA.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the cloned Escherichia coli wild-type gyrA gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for DNA gyrase A-mediated quinolone resistance. The results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of Gram-negative species including E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The use of an arithmetical MIC series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening for the detection of altered gyrase A. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that DNA gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase A-mediated resistance can occur in all.
TI  - Novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus Pseudomonas. We found that a new Pseudomonas strain, Pseudomonas flavida IF-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pNI10 and pNI20. They were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pNI10 and 2.9 kb for pNI20. Several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (Kmr or Smr) gene were constructed from pNI10 and pNI20. These plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of Pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid DNA by the usual competent cell method. The vectors derived from pNI10 replicated not only in Pseudomonas but also in some other Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.
TI  - Interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of Enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. Seleniated tRNA species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. Two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond to the 80 kDa and 110 kDa subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of E. coli. In those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. The similarity of the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. Antibodies raised against the 80 kDa selenopolypeptide from E. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kDa polypeptide in those organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. These organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhF gene from E. coli. In an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhF gene homologue from Enterobacter aerogenes. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame TGA (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the E. coli gene. This fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, E. coli. Moreover, the E. coli fdhF gene was expressed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Homology among bacterial catalase genes.
AB  - Catalase activities in crude extracts of exponential and stationary phase cultures of various bacteria were visualized following gel electrophoresis for comparison with the enzymes from Escherichia coli. Citrobacter freundii, Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium exhibited patterns of catalase activity similar to E. coli, including bifunctional HPI-like bands and a monofunctional HPII-like band. Proteus mirabilis, Erwinia carotovora, and Serratia marcescens contained a single band of monofunctional catalase with a mobility intermediate between the HPI-like and HPII-like bands. The cloned genes for catalases HPI (katG) and HPII (katE) from E. coli were used as probes in Southern hybridization analyses for homologous sequences in genomic DNA of the same bacteria. katG was found to hybridize with fragments from C. freudii, Ent. aerogenes, Sal. typhimurium, and K. pneumoniae but not at all with Ed. tarda, P. mirabilis, S. marcesens, or Er. carotovora. katE hybridized with C. freundii and K. pneumoniae DNAs and not with the other bacterial DNAs.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074/005), a new oral cephalosporin, and eight other oral antimicrobials.

TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefadroxil, and the interpretation of disc-susceptibility testing.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a London teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of Gram-negative bacilli. Assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of Gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. No significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. Ninety-five and a half per cent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), Proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) all Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. Of 41 strains of Enterobacter spp., were resistant. Most indole-positive Proteus, and all Serratia and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. Of 30 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, only six had MICs of 16 mg/l or less. For disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm for organisms with MICs of less than 16 mg/l. A zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to MICs of greater than 64 mg/l. Despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin in hospital practice in the U.K.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - Ofloxacin: in-vitro activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was evaluated in  273 bacterial strains isolated from urine. The results showed a remarkable activity against most Gram-negative bacteria and, in particular, against Enterobacter aerogenes, which is very difficult to eradicate even with third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), the product of the malE gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. It is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer Tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). In studies of the maltose system in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, we found that MBP is produced by Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. MBP from all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the E. coli protein and had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). The Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize MBP. The isoelectric points of MBP from different species varied from the acid extreme of E. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of E. aerogenes (8.9). All species with MBP transported maltose with high affinity, although the Vmax for K. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. Maltose chemotaxis was observed only in E. coli and E. aerogenes. In S. typhimurium LT2, Tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. MBP isolated from all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta malE strain of E. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of bone and joint infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Aztreonam was used successfully in 17 of 17 patients with orthopedic infections due to gram-negative bacilli (11, osteomyelitis; six, septic arthritis). Duration of treatment ranged from 14 to 55 days, and the period of follow-up was four to 18 months. Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter gergoviae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Aztreonam was well tolerated. The only definite reactions attributable to aztreonam were asymptomatic increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) and serum alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) in four patients; none of these reactions interfered with completion of therapy. Adverse reactions that were possibly attributable to aztreonam included rash (two patients), diarrhea (one patient), and leukopenia (one patient). All of these patients were receiving antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms in mixed infections in addition to aztreonam. Aztreonam is a promising new monobactam without significant toxicity. It has good activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, and is effective in the treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative aerobes.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from Nsukka meat market: a zoonotic appraisal.
AB  - Swabs collected from butchers hands, knives, tables and meat displayed for sale at Nsukka meat market showed that every item screened was contaminated. Bacteria isolated include Streptococcus faecalis, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Brucella species, Corynebacterium haemolyticum, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas multophilia, P. rubescens and beta-haemolytic Streptococci. The zoonotic or public health implications of such contaminations, their probable sources and possible ways of minimizing them are discussed.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of FK 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  - FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Survey, purification, and properties of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms.
AB  - Sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase was purified approximately 500- to 600-fold to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli C, Escherichia coli var. communior, Escherichia acidilactici, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, and Saccharomyces cereviseae. The molecular weights of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration ranged from 97 X 10(3) to 101 X 10(3). The enzyme was composed of two subunits with the same molecular weight which ranged from 50 X 10(3) to 52 X 10(3), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Homogeneous enzyme preparations hydrolyse all the tested alpha-D-aldohexose 1-phosphate, D-(keto or aldo)hexose 6-phosphate, and pentose phosphate substrates significantly. When the microorganisms were transferred from growth medium with 1% glucose to that without glucose, there were dramatic increases in both the specific and total enzyme activities. At least three isozymes appeared to be present in S. cereviseae, and two appeared to be present in E. coli B, E. coli var. communior, and N. meningitidis. Rabbit antiserum immunized against sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase purified from E. coli B cross-reacted with both the crude extracts and purified preparations of the enzyme from the other microorganisms. The presence of neither sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity nor immunocrossreacting material was detected in the following microorganisms: Aspergillus niger, Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilis, Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium butyricum, Corynebacterium xerosis, Flavobacterium aquatile, Flavobacterium synxanthum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Micrococcus coralinus, Neisseria perflava, Neurospora crassa, Penicilium expansum, Penicilium notatum, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Saccharomyces fermenti, Sarcina lutea, and Streptomyces antibioticus. At present, no conclusive relationship can be established between the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and the enzyme sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms. The physiological role of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase as a transferase and regulatory enzyme is discussed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). Fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. Episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. Twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones were polymicrobial. Significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: Escherichia coli (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Pseudomonas cepacia (1), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (2), Klebsiella (2), Enterobacter aerogenes (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Total dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). The overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. Local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. Enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. Ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Histamine-producing bacteria in decomposing skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).
AB  - Spoilage in skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) was studied under controlled conditions by incubating whole, fresh fish in seawater at 38 degrees C, the optimum temperature for histamine formation. Bacterial isolates were obtained from the loin tissue of a decomposing tuna containing 134 mg of histamine per 100 g and a total anaerobic count of 3.5 x 10(5)/g after incubation for 24 h. Over 92% of the 134 isolates obtained were facultatively or obligately anaerobic bacteria. Eighteen isolates produced histamine in culture media containing histidine, and these were identified as Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Vibrio alginolyticus. Histidine decarboxylase activity of several isolates was measured in a tuna broth medium and with resting cells suspended in a buffered histidine solution.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-Pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  - Apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of Escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). Apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter diversus. Against Klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. The activity of apalcillin against Enterobacter (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, and E. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. The activity of apalcillin against Proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive Proteus and Providencia. Only 40% of Serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. Apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. It was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). There was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. Apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of FR-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of FR-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(N-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The in vitro activity of FR-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR-31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter. It was less active than fosfomycin against Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. FR-31564 inhibited a number of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. In the presence and absence of human blood FR-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and P. aeruginosa exposed to FR-31564 for 3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. FR-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with P. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. It was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with E. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - Antigenic relationships between pore proteins of Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Antisera were raised against the purified Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane proteins ompA-, ompC- and ompF proteins and protein e. Several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. Although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. The three general porins ompF protein, ompC protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. Anti-(ompA protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. None of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein III. Pore protein preparations isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloaceae and Proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the E. coli K12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against E. coli K12 porins.
TI  - [Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of representatives of the enterobacteriaceae family in postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis].
AB  - The irradiation of CBA mice with gamma quanta in a dose of 700 C/kg resulted in the development of postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis in the animals. The dysbacteriosis was characterized by a considerable increase in the number of Escherichia and Proteus mirabilis in the large intestine and by the insemination of the small intestine with these microbial associations. Pr. vulgaris, Pr. morganii, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae, Citrobacter appeared in great numbers in the intestinal tract of the irradiated mice, while none of these organisms were found in the intact mice.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - [The role of enteric bacteria in childhood urinary tract infections and their in  vitro response to antimicrobial agents].
AB  - In this study, 154 cases of suspected bacterial urinary tract infection were examined bacteriologically. Urine cultures yielded, E. coli in 84 patients Citrobacter in 22 (C. freundii: 9, C. diversus: 9) Proteus in 21 (P. vulgaris: 6, P. morgani: 4, P. rettgeri: 2. P. mirabilis: 4, lactose fermenting strains: 5), Pseudomonas in 12 (P. aeruginosa: 5, other strains of Pseudomonas: 7), Klebsiella in 9 (K. aerogenes: 3, K. pneumonia: 6) and Enterobacter in 6 patients (E. aerogenes: 1, E. cloacae: 5). In vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that gentamicin, nalidixic acid, bactrim and gantrisin were the most effective antibacterial agents respectively. Multiple resistances was found in 39 strains of E. coli out of 84. In other species multiple resistance was found in varying degrees. It is concluded that. Every measure should be taken to eradicate the causative organisms in the urinary tract in children.
TI  - Comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Differentiation of Serratia marcescens and Serratia liquefaciens by tests for lipase and phospholipase production.
AB  - The production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the Enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. Most strains of Serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of Serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. Enterobacter spp. (25 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (15 strains), Citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and Proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of Enterobacter cloacae, two of Proteus mirabilis and three of Proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. It is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for DNAase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies with BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against 90 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes, were studied by using an agar dilution procedure. Comparison of geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentrations showed that BL-S786 was half as active as cefamandole against Enterobacter species, 2 to 4 times more active than cefamandole against all other species, and 4 to 25 times more active than cefoxitin against all species. In vivo experiments employed acute protection tests in infected mice, using five isolates each of the five genera. Drugs were administered intramuscularly in two doses 3 h apart at dosages of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per mouse. In most instances, BL-S786 was the most efficacious drug, being some 1.3 to 9.1 times more active than cefoxitin in all experiments and 1.5 to 8.7 times more active than cefamandole in most experiments. BL-S786 and cefamandole were comparable in activity in experiments with E. aerogenes, whereas BL-S786 was superior in experiments with E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cefaclor (Lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (BL-S640, SK&F 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. They were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. Cefaclor and cefatrizine were found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. Only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. Cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the cephalosporins were particularly active against Enterobacter cloacae. Both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against Proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive Proteus species.
TI  - BL-S786, a new parenteral cephalosporin. II. In vitro antimicrobial activity comparison with six related cephalosporins.
AB  - BL-S786 was compared by in vitro studies with 6 other parenteral cephalosporins (cefamandole, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephradine). The following parameters were assessed: Comparative MICs against a wide variety of bacterial isolates, MIC/MBC comparisons and the effect of inoculum size on the MIC. BL-S786 showed the greatest antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, C. diversus and Salmonella species; was equal to cefamandole against E. coli, E. agglomerans and P. mirabilis; and was second to cefamandole against Shigella, E. tarda, C. freundii, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes and the pathogenic Neisseriae. Essentially no activity against Serratia and Pseudomonas species was observed. Compared to the other cephalosporins tested BL-S786 showed poor activity against staphylococci and streptococci. For most species tested, the MBC of the various cephalosporins was the same or within one dilution of their respective MICs. However, for Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species, the MBC of BL-S786 and cefamandole was usually larger than or equal to 8-fold higher than the MICs. Cefoxitin, on the other hand, showed little MIC/MBC variations against indole-positive Proteus species. Inoculum size had only a small effect on the MICs against most gram-negative species--in some instances greater than 64-fold increases in MIC resulted by increasing inoculum size from 10(5) to 10(7) organisms per ml.
TI  - Laboratory studies on mecillinam: activity alone and combined with cephradine.
AB  - Mecillinam (MC) was found to be inhibitory at low concentrations to a wide range  of Gram-negative bacteria; the sensitivity of such strains could be predicted by using a 10 microgram disk. Resistance to MC did not appear to be associated with beta-lactamase-mediated destruction of the antibiotic. Ampicillin-resistant strains tended to be less sensitive to MC. MC and cephradine acted synergistically against Proteus mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris, Prov. stuartii and Serratia marcescens, and the combination was additive against most Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  - A novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
TI  - Intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol. The mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, and C. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Edwardsiella tarda and Escherichia coli formed calcite III crystals, whereas Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation process of kidney stone formation.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  - Cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. Studies  were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. At obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. In agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive Proteus but not Enterobacter. Moreover, in broth medium most strains of Enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. However, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive Proteus. Cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of E. coli. These data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive Proteus species as well as some other Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, with the exception of strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and not in broth.
TI  - Susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  - Combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. Synergistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were noted against most strains of E. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. Of 16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of E. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin G with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. The marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.
TI  - Use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group D streptococci. All members of the Enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. One thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. Heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 C. The slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. Shigella, Salmonella, Arizona, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Providencia alcalifaciens, and Providencia stuartii all produced negative results. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. The other remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. The use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group from other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Herd studies on coliform mastitis.
AB  - Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63, 10, and 11 percent, respectively, of 158 coliform organisms recovered from mastitis cases in 8 California herds. The severity and nature of the coliform mastitis problem were found to vary greatly among herds but were characteristic for each of 4 herds studied in detail.
TI  - Cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1H-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. Enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Cefamandole was very active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of Escherichia coli, 86% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of Proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. A number of Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Pseudomonas species were resistant. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. Similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. Resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
TI  - Butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.
TI  - Changes in antibiotic sensitivity patterns of Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - Sensitivity tests with 12 antibiotics on 1,018 strains of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in a burns unit between 1969 and 1971 showed some important differences from results in similar tests on a series of strains isolated between 1965 and 1967. These changes included the emergence of a large proportion of kanamycin-resistant strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli and of smaller proportions of trimethoprim- and gentamicin-resistant strains; also the complete replacement of Proteus mirabilis with dissociated resistance to ampicillin by strains showing linked resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The probable relationship of these changes to the emergence of an R factor determining resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine in Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is discussed.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - In a period of two years, 865 strains of Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. The commonest species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Many strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Bacterium anitratum were also found.A large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. The proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. A large proportion of the strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. Multiple resistance occurred less often among strains of E. coli than among Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, and P. mirabilis. Phage and serological typing of Ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. Taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with Ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.
TI  - Polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. The amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. In only three cases: Escherichia coli-Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium-S. typhi, and Proteus mirabilis-P. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. In most cases interspecies DNA duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies DNA reassociation reactions. The stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 C was virtually identical to that of homologous E. coli DNA duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected by the temperature increase (86% at 60 C; 77% at 75 C). The thermal stability of DNA duplexes formed at 60 C between DNA from E. coli and DNA from strains of Aerobacter aerogenes, S. typhimurium, S. typhi, and P. mirabilis was about 12 to 14 C below that of reassociated E. coli DNA. At 75 C, the formation of the interspecific DNA duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the DNA able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated E. coli DNA. The degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of E. coli-S. flexneri DNA duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. The other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their DNA can reanneal with E. coli DNA at 60 C and less than 10% reacts at 75 C. The degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the DNA molecule. Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. An examination of messenger RNA relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less than the genome as a whole.
TI  - Role of lipid in the protection of Staphylococcus aureus against trichlorophenol  in mixed culture.
AB  - The sensitivities of Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus to 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol in sodium borate were studied. It was demonstrated that these gram-negative organisms can protect S. aureus from the effect of the phenol in mixed culture. There is a direct correlation between this protective effect and the quantity of total lipid extracted from the gram-negative organisms. The distribution coefficient between trichlorophenol and the lipid of the cells is related to the sensitivity and capacity to protect S. aureus in mixed culture. Hydrogen bonding between the cell's lipid and the phenolic compound is discussed as a possible mechanism which determines a cell's response to the inhibitor.
TI  - IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CEPHALOTHIN.
AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
