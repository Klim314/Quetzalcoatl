TI  == [changes in the phase variant spectra in the populations of lactic acid bacteria  under antibiotic treatment].
AB  == effect of the antibiotics kanamycin and ampicillin on growth and phase variation  of the populations of four strains of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus sp. m67at, l. casei mb, enterococcus faecium m, and e. faecium m3185) was studied. the presence of antibiotics in the medium resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viable cell numbers and in partial or complete substitution of the dominant s  variant with the minor sm and sb variants. the variants differed in colony morphology, as well as in some physiological, biochemical, biotechnological, and  probiotic characteristics. the sm type variants of all strains exhibited the highest resistance to antibiotics. high production of exopolysaccharides was found in sb variants of lactobacilli and in s variants of enterococci. the highest antibacterial activity was found in sm variants of lactobacilli, especially in lactobacillus sp. m76at the latter is biotechnologically the most promising strain, since all variants fermented milk yielding the products with uniformly pronounced functional and organoleptic properties. these patterns are of importance for the understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and for selection of the variants with desired properties, as well as for quality control of the lactic acid bacteria starter cultures.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == selenite-stress selected mutant strains of probiotic bacteria for se source production.
AB  == selenium deficiency is a major health problem worldwide for about 1 billion people. bacterial cells usually possess low tolerance to selenite stress and also low ability to reduce high concentrations of toxic selenite. here, high tolerance to selenite and selenium bioaccumulation capability were developed in mutated clones of probiotic and starter bacteria including enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis by food-level strain development process and clone selection. all mutant clones possessed increased glutathione concentration and glutathione reductase activity. the selenite treatment increased further these values in l. casei mutant strain pointing at a different selenite reduction pathway and/or stress response in this organism. considerable conversion of selenite to cell bound selenium forms with a concomitant high biomass production was detected in e. faecium and b. animalis ssp. lactis cultures. possible application of these strains as food and feed supplements is under investigation.

TI  == potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
AB  == the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference  strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.

TI  == isolation of enterococcus faecium nm113, enterococcus faecium nm213 and lactobacillus casei nm512 as novel probiotics with immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == probiotics, defined as living bacteria that are beneficial for human health, mainly function through their immunomodulatory abilities. hence, these microorganisms have proven successful for treating diseases resulting from immune deregulation. the aim of this study was to find novel candidates to improve on and complement current probiotic treatment strategies. of 60 lactic acid bacterial strains that were isolated from fecal samples of healthy, full-term, breast-fed infants, three were chosen because of their ability to activate human  immune cells. these candidates were then tested with regard to immunomodulatory properties, antimicrobial effects on pathogens, required pharmacological properties and their safety profiles. to identify the immunomodulatory structures of the selected isolates, activation of specific innate immune receptors was studied. the three candidates for probiotic treatment were assigned enterococcus  faecium nm113, enterococcus faecium nm213 and lactobacillus casei nm512. compared with the established allergy-protective strain lactococcus lactis g121, these isolates induced release of similar amounts of il-12, a potent inducer of t helper 1 cells. in addition, all three neonatal isolates had antimicrobial activity against pathogens. analysis of pharmacological suitability showed high tolerance of low ph, bile salts and pancreatic enzymes. in terms of safe application in humans, the isolates were sensitive to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin). in addition, the enterococcus isolates were free from the four major virulence genes (cyla, agg, efaafs and ccf). moreover, the isolates strongly activated toll-like receptor 2, which suggests lipopeptides as their active immunomodulatory structure. thus, three novel bacterial strains with great potential as probiotic candidates and promising immunomodulatory properties have here been identified and characterized.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == a novel type of peptidoglycan-binding domain highly specific for amidated d-asp cross-bridge, identified in lactobacillus casei bacteriophage endolysins.
AB  == peptidoglycan hydrolases (pghs) are responsible for bacterial cell lysis. most pghs have a modular structure comprising a catalytic domain and a cell wall-binding domain (cwbd). pghs of bacteriophage origin, called endolysins, are  involved in bacterial lysis at the end of the infection cycle. we have characterized two endolysins, lc-lys and lc-lys-2, identified in prophages present in the genome of lactobacillus casei bl23. these two enzymes have different catalytic domains but similar putative c-terminal cwbds. by analyzing purified peptidoglycan (pg) degradation products, we showed that lc-lys is an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, whereas lc-lys-2 is a gamma-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl endopeptidase. remarkably, both lysins were able to lyse only gram-positive bacterial strains that possess pg with d-ala(4)-->d-asx-l-lys(3) in their cross-bridge, such as lactococcus casei, lactococcus lactis, and enterococcus faecium. by testing a panel of l. lactis cell wall mutants, we observed that lc-lys and lc-lys-2 were not able to lyse mutants with a modified pg cross-bridge, constituting d-ala(4)-->l-ala-(l-ala/l-ser)-l-lys(3); moreover, they do not lyse the l. lactis mutant containing only the nonamidated d-asp cross-bridge, i.e. d-ala(4)-->d-asp-l-lys(3). in contrast, lc-lys could lyse the ampicillin-resistant e. faecium mutant with 3-->3 l-lys(3)-d-asn-l-lys(3) bridges replacing the wild-type 4-->3 d-ala(4)-d-asn-l-lys(3) bridges. we showed that the c-terminal cwbd of lc-lys binds pg containing mainly d-asn but not pg with only the nonamidated d-asp-containing cross-bridge, indicating that the cwbd confers to lc-lys its narrow specificity. in conclusion, the cwbd characterized in this study is a novel type of pg-binding domain targeting specifically the d-asn interpeptide bridge of pg.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == bioconversion of oleuropein to hydroxytyrosol by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this work is to study the conversion of oleuropein-a polyphenol present in olives and olive oil by-products-into hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenol with antioxidant and antibacterial properties. the hydrolysis reaction is performed by lactic acid bacteria. six bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum 6907, lactobacillus paracasei 9192, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium lactis bo, enterococcus faecium 32, lactobacillus lafti 10) were tested under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the oleuropein degradation and hydroxytyrosol formation were monitored by hplc. results showed that oleuropein could be successfully converted into hydroxytyrosol. the most effective strain was lactobacillus plantarum 6907, with a reaction yield of hydroxytyrosol of about 30 %. different  reaction mechanisms were observed for different microorganisms; a different yield was observed for lactobacillus paracasei 9192 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and an intermediate metabolite (oleuropein aglycone) was detected for  lactobacillus paracasei 9192 and lactobacillus plantarum 6907 only. this study could have significant applications, as this reaction can be used to increase the value of olive oil by-products and/or to improve the taste of unripe olives.

TI  == metabolites of lactobacillus plantarum 2142 prevent oxidative stress-induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in ipec-j2 cell line.
AB  == probiotics have already proven beneficial effects in the treatment of several intestinal infections, but the underlying mechanisms how the probiotics can affect responses of porcine ipec-j2 enterocytes to oxidative stress remained to be elucidated. the immunomodulatory effect of five bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum 2142, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, bacillus amyloliquefaciens cect 5940 and enterococcus faecium cect 4515) on 1 mm peroxide-triggered upregulation of interleukin (il)-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) level was screened by q rt-pcr. our data revealed that spent culture supernatant (scs) of l. plantarum 2142 had significant lowering effect on il-8 and tnf-alpha level with concomitant promoting activity on protective hsp70 gene expression. according to  our results, lactic acid (racemic, d: - and l: -lactic acid) and acetic acid produced by lactobacilli had no protective effect in quenching upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. furthermore, l. plantarum 2142-specific supernatant peptides were detected by gel electrophoresis and capillary zone electrophoresis.

TI  == newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  == five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rrna sequencing. essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low ph, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. antimicrobial activities  against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. further studies revealed weissella and enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in  the human diet. the folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using lactobacillus casei ncim 2364 as indicator strain. the three strains of l. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against  various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus faecalis cp58 isolated from human gut.
AB  == a total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low ph conditions. species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus. these strains  were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. e. faecalis was the most adherent strain. examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaafs, gele, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many e. faecalis isolates from food sources. the cytolysin biosynthetic genes cyla, cylb  and cylm that are more associated with the clinical isolates of e. faecium were not detected in this strain. the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that the  strain e. faecalis cp58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == the influence of some probiotic supernatants on the growth and virulence features expression of several selected enteroaggregative e. coli clinical strains.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of three probiotic  supernatants (bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, enterococcus faecium atcc 19434,  lactobacillus casei subsp. casei atcc 393) on the growth (quantified by viable cell counts) and virulence features expression (adherence ability to hep-2 cells  and inert substratum- slime test) of several selected eaggec diarrhoeagenic strains as well as the cytotoxicity of the respective supernatants on hep-2 cells. results: our in vitro studies are demonstrating that the selected supernatants, when added simultaneously with the bacterial culture are generally  opposing to the adherence to the cellular substratum by the eaggec strains. when  added after the pre-adherence period, the supernatants did not change the adherence indexes of the eaggec strains, but induced slight changes in the adherence pattern, reducing the frequency and size of bacterial aggregates. only  in few cases, the bacterial growth rate was slightly increased or sustained by the probiotic supernatants, a possible explanation being that we used supernatants obtained from 24 hrs fresh cultures, which are probably still containing some nutrients and probably also other growth factors. conclusion: our results are demonstrating that soluble probiotic metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants may interfere with the first step of adherence and colonization of the cellular and inert substrata by eaggec strains, probablyby the cross-talk between probiotic soluble molecules and quorum-sensing mediators of opportunistic strains; so, direct contact between the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria are not always necessary for the occurrence of a protective effect, that could be partly mediated by the soluble molecules secreted by specific probiotic  strains.

TI  == influence of microfiltration and adjunct culture on quality of domiati cheese.
AB  == the effects of microfiltration and pasteurization processes on proteolysis, lipolysis, and flavor development in domiati cheese during 2 mo of pickling were  studied. cultures of starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from egyptian dairy products were evaluated in experimental domiati cheese for flavor development capabilities. in the first trial, raw skim milk was microfiltered and then the protein:fat ratio was standardized using pasteurized cream. pasteurized milk with same protein:fat ratio was also used in the second trial. the chemical composition of cheeses seemed to be affected by milk treatment-microfiltration or pasteurization-rather than by the culture types. the moisture content was higher  and the ph was lower in pasteurized milk cheeses than in microfiltered milk cheeses at d 1 of manufacture. chemical composition of experimental cheeses was within the legal limits for domiati cheese in egypt. proteolysis and lipolysis during cheese pickling were lower in microfiltered milk cheeses compared with pasteurized milk cheeses. highly significant variations in free amino acids, free fatty acids, and sensory evaluation were found among the cultures used in domiati cheesemaking. the cheese made using adjunct culture containing lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and enterococcus faecium received high scores in  flavor acceptability. cheeses made from microfiltered milk received a higher score in body and texture compared with cheeses made from pasteurized milk.

AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
AB  == the effects of nine probiotic strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were examined. the culture supernatant of the e. faecium strain, with or without ph adjustment to a neutral  ph, had a strong bactericidal effect on eaggec, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. supernatants of the l. casei ss. casei and l. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on eaggec, but this activity was abolished by ph adjustment to a neutral ph. no inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of bifidobacterium or e. faecalis strains was detected. adhesion of  eaggec to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains  tested. two strains of l. casei enhanced eaggec biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. these results suggest that the three different bacterial species; lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus, have different effects on eaggec, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against eaggec infection.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana, a traditional turkish fermented food.
AB  == tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in turkey. the aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated during processing of tarhana. samples were collected from eight different regions of turkey. in order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. a total of 226 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from mrs, m17 and  sbm (slanetz and bartley medium). the isolates were grouped and identified using  a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-pcr fingerprinting [(gtg)(5) primer], multiplex pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of  the isolates, 19% were identified as streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as enterococcus faecium, 7% as pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as weissella cibaria, 2% as lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as leuconostoc citreum, 1% as lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as lactobacillus casei. the different production sites investigated all had individual lab profiles, but with p. acidilactici and s. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. the main source of p. acidilactici and s.  thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (dfm) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with  feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. fifteen mature thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 latin square design balanced for carryover effects. within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (ls; 1.2 g of starch x kg  of bw(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (hs; 2.4 g of starch.kg of bw(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. the dfm treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of bw x d) as follows: no dfm (con; control), lactobacillus acidophilus (lac1; single-species dfm), or a mixture of l. acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum, and enterococcus faecium (lac4; multiple-species dfm). total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (ls; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (ac; abrupt change  in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (hs; high dietary starch collection). data collected consisted of total  dm intake and fecal output, fecal ph, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of dfm in the feed. with the exception of fe digestibility, there were no starch x dfm interactions. there was an effect of starch level (p <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for mg (p = 0.08) and cp, k, and zn (p > 0.10). horses supplemented with lac4 had increased ether extract (p < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased na (p < 0.10) digestibilities compared with con horses. all dfm-supplemented horses had increased cu (p < 0.05) and fe and numerically increased zn digestibilities compared with con horses. fecal ph decreased (p < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (p < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from ls to hs. there was a tendency for elevated fecal ph (p < 0.10) in lac1 horses compared with con horses. these results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet  can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated  with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. the potential response of dfm supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == homofermentative lactic acid bacteria of a traditional cheese, comlek peyniri from cappadocia region.
AB  == comlek peyniri is a typical artisanal cheese in central anatolia. this type of cheese was made by using the indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora of cow or ewes' milk. majority of the samples were taken from fresh cheese because the aim was to isolate homofermentative lab. initially 661 microbial isolates were obtained from 17 cheese samples. only 107 were found to be homofermentative lab.  these isolates were selected and identified by using both phenotypic and molecular methods. phenotypic identification included curd formation from skim milk, catalase test, gram staining and light microscopy, growth at different temperatures and salt concentrations, arginine hydrolysis, gas production from glucose, and carbohydrate fermentation. molecular identification was based on the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) of  the 16s rrna gene-its (internally transcribed spacer) region. by combining the phenotypic and molecular identification results, isolates belonging to each of the following genera were determined at species or subspecies level: 54 lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 3 ec. faecalis, 2 ec.  durans, 10 ec. sp., 15 lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and 2 lb. casei  strains. technological characterisation was also performed by culturing each of the strains in uht skim milk, and by monitoring ph change and lactic acid production at certain time intervals through the 24 h incubation. results of the  technological characterisation indicated that 33% of the isolates (35 strains) were capable of lowering the ph of uht milk below 5.3 after 6 h incubation at 30  degrees c. thirty four of these strains were lc. lactis subsp. lactis, and only one was an ec. faecium strain.

AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == characterization of the properties of human- and dairy-derived probiotics for prevention of infectious diseases in fish.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the potential probiotic properties of six  lactic acid bacteria (lab) intended for human use, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. rhamnosus lc 705, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, and lactobacillus johnsonii la1, and one for animal use, enterococcus faecium tehobak, for use as a fish probiotic. the strains for human use were specifically chosen since they are known to be safe for human use, which is of major importance because the fish are meant for human  consumption. the selection was carried out by five different methods: mucosal adhesion, mucosal penetration, inhibition of pathogen growth and adhesion, and resistance to fish bile. the adhesion abilities of the seven lab and three fish pathogens, vibrio anguillarum, aeromonas salmonicida, and flavobacterium psychrophilum, were determined to mucus from five different sites on the surface  or in the gut of rainbow trout. five of the tested lab strains showed considerable adhesion to different fish mucus types (14 to 26% of the added bacteria). despite their adhesive character, the lab strains were not able to inhibit the mucus binding of a. salmonicida. coculture experiments showed significant inhibition of growth of a. salmonicida, which was mediated by competition for nutrients rather than secretion of inhibitory substances by the probiotic bacteria as measured in spent culture liquid. all lab except l. casei shirota showed tolerance against fish bile. l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus were found to penetrate fish mucus better than other probiotic bacteria. based on bile resistance, mucus adhesion, mucus penetration, and suppression of fish pathogen growth, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus can be considered for future in vivo challenge studies in fish as a novel and safe treatment in aquaculture.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == combined effect of bacteriocins on the survival of various listeria species in broth and meat system.
AB  == the antilisterial efficiency of three bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria, lactocin 705 (produced by l. casei crl705, 17000 au/ml), enterocin crl35 (produced by e. faecium crl35, 17000 au/ml), and nisin (2000 iu/ml), was tested in broth, individually and in combination against listeria monocytogenes and listeria innocua. both listeria species showed an initial decrease in viable counts followed by the regrowth of the survivors after 1 h in the presence of each bacteriocin. a greater antilisterial effect was observed when the bacteriocins were combined in pairs, maximal inhibition being reached when nisin  was involved. when a mix of the three bacteriocins was used, no survivors were observed after 24 h of incubation. similar results were obtained when the bacteriocin combinations were tested in a meat system, indicating that the use of more than one lab bacteriocin in combination may be effective in preventing the spontaneous emergence of a bacteriocin-resistant listeria population.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  == we reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with  the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering  of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. the most widely studied probiotic bacteria were lactobacillus gg (22 studies), lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and  enterococcus faecium (7 studies). intake of lactobacillus gg consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. however, evidence for the prevention by lactobacillus gg and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. cholesterol lowering by l. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by e. faecium seems to be transient. two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. the production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. in conclusion, consumption of foods containing lactobacillus gg may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == 2-amino-4-oxo-5-substituted-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as nonclassical antifolate  inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  == six novel 2-amino-4-oxo-5-[(substituted phenyl)sulfanyl]pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines 7-12 were synthesized as potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (ts) and as antitumor and/or antibacterial agents. the analogues contain a 5-thio substituent with a phenyl, 4'-chlorophenyl, 3',4'-dichlorophenyl, 4'-nitrophenyl, 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl, and 2'-naphthyl on the sulfur, and were synthesized from the key intermediate 2-(pivaloylamino)-4-oxo-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine, 17. appropriately substituted aryl thiols were appended to the 5-position of 17 via an oxidative addition reaction using iodine, ethanol, and water under conditions which also resulted in the deprotection of the 2-amino group. the compounds were evaluated against human, lactobacillus casei, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecium, and pneumocystis carinii (pc) tss and against human, rat liver (rl), pc, and toxoplasma gondii (tg) dhfrs. the nonclassical analogues with the 3',4'-dichloro and the 4'-nitro substituents in the side chain (9 and 10) were more potent than n-[4-[n-[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-n-prop- 2-ynylamino]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (pddf, 1) and n-[5-[n-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-n- methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-l-glutamic acid (zd1694,2) against human ts. analogues with the 4'-chloro, 3',4'-dimethoxy, and naphthyl side chains (8, 11 and 12) were more potent than the unsubstituted phenyl analogue (7) but less than 2, 9, and 10 by 1 order of magnitude. they were all poor inhibitors of human, rl, and pc dhfrs (ic50 = 10(-5) m) but moderate inhibitors (ic50 = 10(-6) m) of tg dhfr. the 4-nitro analogue, 10 (ec50 1.5 microm), was comparable to pddf in its potency as  an inhibitor of the growth of the fadu human squamous cell carcinoma cell line.

AB  == differences in species composition, number and level of antagonistic activity of  bacteria isolated from the digestive tract of chernobyl female minks of various age and with different immunological state have been established. prevalence of anaerobes (bifidobacteria) and microaerophils (lactic acid bacteria) with the increase of microorganisms concentration along the channel: stomach, small and large intestine (10(7)-10(10)/g) was found in all the departments of digestive tract of minks. among the identified lactic-acid bacteria lactobacillus helveticus (10(7)-10(8)/g) prevailed in the stomach of the studied female minks,  l. coryniformis (10(9)-10(10)/g) in the small intestine, l. casei (10(10)/g) in the large one. antagonistic activity was most expressed in the strains of l. helveticus and l. casei, isolated from the younger (1.5 year-old) minks. enterococcus faecalis isolated from the stomach of 1.5 year-old female minks was  distinguished by the greatest antagonistic activity among identified enterococci. strains of e. faecium isolated from the thin intestine of the young female minks  (1.5 year-old) and from the large intestine of more nature animals (2.5 years) who received thymogen were characterized by the most expressed antibiosis among enterococci isolated bacteria a conclusion was made that the mechanisms of inhibitory effect of the studied microorganisms are underlied by not only their capacity to form organic acids but also by the capacity to produce antibiotic products.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant vanb-type enterococcus d366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  == the biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan udp-murnac-peptide precursors. in all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the  c-terminal d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified c terminus. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in enterococcus faecium d366, a strain belonging to the vanb class, which expresses low-level resistance  to vancomycin, was udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, identical  to that previously found in the vana class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. high-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by r39 d,d-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in lactobacillus casei and pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. the low-level natural resistance of enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a udp-murnac-pentapeptide containing a c-terminal d-serine. the distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus casei synthesize cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in lactate.
AB  == the emergence of acquired high-level resistance among enterococcus species has renewed interest in mechanisms of resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics in gram-positive bacteria. in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, resistance is encoded by the van gene cluster and is due to the production of a peptidoglycan precursor terminating in d-alanyl-d-lactate, to which vancomycin does not bind. most leuconostoc and many lactobacillus species are intrinsically  resistant to high levels of glycopeptide antibiotics, but the mechanism of resistance has not been elucidated. to determine whether the mechanisms of resistance are similar in intrinsically resistant bacteria, cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors were isolated from leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus casei and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing structures consistent with udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-(l-ala)-d-ala-d-lactate and udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, respectively.
