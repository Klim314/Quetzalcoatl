pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase overexpression in escherichia coli resulted in high ethanol production and rewired metabolic enzyme networks.
pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase are efficient enzymes for ethanol production in zymomonas mobilis. these two enzymes were over-expressed in escherichia coli, a promising candidate for industrial ethanol production, resulting in high ethanol production in the engineered e. coli. to investigate the intracellular changes to the enzyme overexpression for homoethanol production, 2-de and lc-ms/ms were performed. more than 1,000 protein spots were reproducibly detected in the gel by image analysis. compared to the wild-type, 99 protein spots showed significant changes in abundance in the recombinant e. coli, in which 46 were down-regulated and 53 were up-regulated. most proteins related to tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycerol metabolism and other energy metabolism were up-regulated, whereas proteins involved in glycolysis and glyoxylate pathway were down-regulated, indicating the rewired metabolism in the engineered e. coli. as glycolysis is the main pathway for ethanol production, and it was inhibited significantly in engineered e. coli, further efforts should be directed at minimizing the repression of glycolysis to optimize metabolism network for higher yields of ethanol production.
use of an ez-tn5-based random mutagenesis system to create a zymomonas mobilis with significant tolerance to heat stress and malnutrition.
during ethanol production, the fermentation cells are always exposed to stresses  like high temperature and low nutritional conditions, which affect their growth and productivity. stress-tolerant strains with high ethanol yield are highly desirable. therefore, a recombinant zymomonas mobilis (z. mobilis) designated as hym was constructed by integrating three genes (yfdz, metb, and pfu-shsp) into the genome of z. mobilis cp4 (cp4) via tn5 transposon in the present study. the yfdz and metb genes from e. coli were used to decrease the nutritional requirement. the small heat shock protein gene (pfu-shsp) from pyrococcus furiosus (p. furiosus) was used to increase the heat tolerance. the genomic integration of three genes confers on z. mobilis the ability to grow in simple chemical defined medium without the addition of amino acid. the hym not only demonstrated the high tolerance to unfavorable lower nutrition stresses but also the capability of converting glucose to ethanol with high yield at higher temperature. what is more, these genetic characteristics were stable up to 100 generations on nonselective medium. the effects of glucose concentration, fermentation temperature, and initial ph on ethanol production of the mutant strain hym were optimized using a box-behnken design (bbd) experiment. the integration of three genes led to a significant increase in ethanol production by 9 % compared with its original z. mobilis counterpart. the maximum ethanol production of hym was as high as 105 g/l.
use of a tn5-based transposon system to create a cost-effective zymomonas mobilis for ethanol production from lignocelluloses.
background: current methods of ethanol production from lignocelluloses generate a mixture of sugars, primarily glucose and xylose; the fermentation cells are always exposed to stresses like high temperature and low nutritional conditions that affect their growth and productivity. stress-tolerant strains capable of using both glucose and xylose to produce ethanol with high yield are highly desirable. results: a recombinant zymomonas mobilis (z. mobilis) designated as hymx was constructed by integrating seven genes (pfu-shsp, yfdz, metb, xyla, xylb, tkta and talb) into the genome of z. mobilis cp4 (cp4) via tn5 transposon in the present study. the small heat shock protein gene (pfu-shsp) from pyrococcus furious (p. furious) was used to increase the heat-tolerance, the yfdz and metb genes from e. coli were used to decrease the nutritional requirement. to overcome the bottleneck of cp4 being unable to use pentose, xylose catabolic genes (xyla, xylb, tkta and talb) from e. coli were integrated into cp4 also for construction of the xylose utilizing metabolic pathway. conclusions: the genomic integration confers on z. mobilis the ability to grow in medium containing xylose as the only carbon source, and to grow in simple chemical defined medium without addition of amino acid. the hymx demonstrated not only the high tolerance to unfavorable stresses like high temperature and low nutrient, but also the capability of converting both glucose and xylose to ethanol with high yield at high temperature. what's more, these genetic characteristics were stable up to 100 generations on nonselective medium. although significant improvements were achieved, yeast extract is needed for ethanol production.
recruiting alternative glucose utilization pathways for improving succinate production.
the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts) of escherichia coli was usually inactivated to increase pep supply for succinate production. however, cell growth and glucose utilization rate decreased significantly with pts inactivation. in this work, two glucose transport proteins and two glucokinases (glk) from e. coli and zymomonas mobilis were recruited in pts(-) strains, and their impacts on glucose utilization and succinate production were compared. all pts(-) strains recruiting z. mobilis glucose facilitator glf had higher glucose utilization rates than pts(-) strains using e. coli galactose permease (galp), which was suggested to be caused by higher glucose transport velocity and lower energetic cost of glf. the highest rate obtained by combinatorial modulation of glf and glk e. coli (2.13 g/l*h) was 81 % higher than the wild-type e. coli and 30 % higher than the highest rate obtained by combinatorial modulation of galp and glk e. coli . on the other hand, although glucokinase activities increased after replacing e. coli glk with isoenzyme of z. mobilis, glucose utilization rate decreased to 0.58 g/l*h, which was assumed due to tight regulation of z. mobilis glk by energy status of the cells. for succinate production, using galp led to a 20 % increase in succinate productivity, while recruiting glf led to a 41 % increase. these efficient alternative glucose utilization pathways obtained in this work can also be used for production of many other pep-derived chemicals, such as malate, fumarate, and aromatic compounds.
inhibition of thiamin diphosphate dependent enzymes by 3-deazathiamin diphosphate.
3-deazathiamin diphosphate (deazatpp) and a second thiamin diphosphate (tpp) analogue having a benzene ring in place of the thiazolium ring have been synthesised. these compounds are both extremely potent inhibitors of pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis; binding is competitive with tpp and is essentially irreversible even though no covalent linkage is formed. deazatpp binds approximately seven-fold faster than tpp and at least 25,000-fold more tightly (k(i) less than 14 pm). deazatpp is also a potent inhibitor of the e1 subunit of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase from e. coli and binds more than 70-fold faster than tpp. in this case slow reversal of the inhibition could be observed and a k(i) value of about 5 nm was calculated (ca. 500-fold tighter binding than tpp).
the cyanobacterium synechococcus sp. strain pcc 7942 contains a second alkaline phosphatase encoded by phov.
a gene (phov) encoding an alkaline phosphatase from synechococcus sp. strain pcc  7942 was isolated by screening a plasmid gene bank for expression of alkaline phosphatase activity in escherichia coli jm103. two independent clones carrying the same alkaline-phosphatase-encoding gene were isolated. one of these clones (pkw1) was further analysed and the nucleotide sequence of a contiguous 3234 bp dna fragment was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf1 and phov) and an incomplete orf3 were identified reading in the same direction. the deduced phov gene product showed 34% identity to the alkaline phosphatase phoa from zymomonas mobilis, and the n-terminal part of the putative orf3 protein exhibited 57% identity to a protein of unknown function from frankia sp. insertional inactivation of the synechococcus pcc 7942 phov gene failed, indicating an essential role for either the phov or the orf3 gene product. phov consists of 550 amino acid residues, resulting in a molecular mass of 61.3 kda. to overexpress the synechococcus pcc 7942 phov gene in e. coli, plasmid pkw1 was transformed into a phoa mutant of e. coli (cc118). in e. coli strain cc118(pkw1) phov was expressed constitutively with high rates of activity, and was shown to be membrane associated in the periplasmic space. after partial purification of the recombinant phov, it was shown that, like other alkaline phosphatases, the synechococcus phov had a broad ph optimum in the alkaline region and a broad substrate specificity for phosphomonoesters, required zn2+ for activity, and was inhibited by phosphate. in contrast to several other alkaline phosphatases, phov was inhibited by mn2+. due to the lack of a synechococcus pcc 7942 phov mutant strain, the function of phov remains uncertain. however, the present results show that synechococcus pcc 7942 has a second, probably phosphate-irrepressible, alkaline phosphatase (phov, 61.3 kda) in addition to the phosphate-repressible enzyme (phoa, 145 kda) already described.
an allosterically insensitive class of cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis.
the key enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis in many gram-negative prokaryotes is cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. the zymomonas mobilis gene (tyrc) coding for this enzyme was cloned in escherichia coli by complementation of a tyrosine auxotroph. the tyrc gene was 882 bp long, encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 32086 da. the z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase expressed in e. coli was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. the subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 32 kda as determined by sds/page. the ratio of the activity of arogenate dehydrogenase to that of prephenate dehydrogenase (approximately 3:1) remained constant throughout purification, and the two activities were therefore inseparable. the genetic and biochemical data obtained demonstrated a single enzyme protein capable of catalyzing either of two reactions. km values of 0.25 mm and 0.18 mm were obtained from prephenate and l-arogenate, respectively. the km value obtained for nad+ (0.09 mm) was the same regardless of whether the enzyme was assayed as arogenate dehydrogenase or as prephenate dehydrogenase. unlike the corresponding enzyme of pseudomonas aeruginosa or e. coli, the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase of z. mobilis lacks sensitivity to feedback inhibition by l-tyrosine. a typical nad(+)-binding domain was found to be located at the n-terminus of the protein. although the deduced amino-acid sequence of the z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase showed relatively low identity (19-32%) with the prephenate dehydrogenases of bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as with the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase components of the bifunctional t-proteins of e. coli and erwinia herbicola, a presumptive motif was identified which may correspond to critical residues of the binding site for cyclohexadienyl substrate molecules. immediately upstream of tryc a portion of a gene was sequenced and found to exhibit clearcut homology of the deduced amino-acid sequence with the b. subtilis hish gene product. thus, the zymomonas gene organization is reminiscent of the linkage of genes encoding a tryosine-pathway dehydrogenase and a histidine-pathway aminotransferase in b. subtilis.
effect of acetic acid on xylose conversion to ethanol by genetically engineered e. coli.
efficient utilization of the pentosan fraction of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic feedstocks offers an opportunity to increase the yield and to reduce the cost of producing fuel ethanol. during prehydrolysis (acid hydrolysis or autohydrolysis of hemicellulose), acetic acid is formed as a consequence of the deacetylation of the acetylated moiety of hemicellulose. recombinant escherichia coli b (atcc 11303), carrying the plasmid plo1297 with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase ii genes from zymomonas mobilis (cp4), converts xylose to ethanol with a product yield that approaches theoretical maximum. although other pentose-utilizing microorganisms are inhibited by acetic acid, the recombinant e. coli displays a high tolerance for acetic acid. in xylose fermentations with a synthetic medium (luria broth), where the ph was controlled at 7, neither yield nor productivity was affected by the addition of 10.7 g/l acetic acid. nutrient-supplemented, hardwood (aspen) hemicellulose hydrolysate (40.7 g/l xylose) was completely fermented to ethanol (16.3 g/l) in 98 h. when the acetic acid concentration was reduced from 5.6 to 0.8 g/l, the fermentation time decreased to 58 h. overliming, with ca(oh)2 to ph 10, followed by neutralization to ph 7 with sulfuric acid and removal of insolubles, resulted in a twofold increase in volumetric productivity. the maximum productivity was 0.93 g/l/h. the xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and productivity in ca(oh)2-treated hardwood prehydrolysate, fortified with only mineral salts, were 94% and 0.26 g/l/h, respectively. the recombinant e. coli exhibits a xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency that is superior to that of other pentose-utilizing yeasts currently being investigated for the production of fuel ethanol from lignocellulosic materials.
isolation of noninhibitory strains of zymomonas mobilis.
wild-type zymomonas mobilis strains inhibit the growth of escherichia coli. we report the first isolation of noninhibitory strains, called zymomonas inhibition negative (zin), after treatment with n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. a standardized soft-agar overlay procedure for detecting e. coli growth inhibition was also developed.
