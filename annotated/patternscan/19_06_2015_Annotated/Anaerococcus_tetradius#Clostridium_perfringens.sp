TI  == modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == at high altitude (ha) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (gi) disorder are very  common phenomena. to explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the gi functions, were subjected following  simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. for this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. it was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the population density of strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (gdi). in relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of iga and igg increased in duration dependent manner. the activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered gsh/gssg pool in the intestinal epithelia. histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. it can be concluded that hypoxia at ha modified gi microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small  intestinal dysfunction at ha.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the in vitro anti-anaerobic activity and spectrum of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against 375 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including gram-negative bacilli (181 strains), gram-negative  cocci (11 strains), gram-positive bacilli (139 strains) and gram-positive cocci (44 strains), covering 34 species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levornidazole, its five metabolites and three comparators against these anaerobic isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of levornidazole and metronidazole were measured against 22 strains of bacteroides fragilis. levornidazole showed good activity against b. fragilis, other bacteroides spp., clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens  and peptostreptococcus magnus, evidenced by mic90 values of 0.5, 1, 0.25, 2 and 1mg/l, respectively. the activity of levornidazole and the comparators was poor for veillonella spp. generally, levornidazole displayed activity similar to or slightly higher than that of metronidazole, ornidazole and dextrornidazole against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive  cocci, especially b. fragilis. favourable anti-anaerobic activity was also seen with levornidazole metabolites m1 and m4 but not m2, m3 or m5. for the 22 clinical b. fragilis strains, mbc50 and mbc90 values of levornidazole were 2mg/l  and 4mg/l, respectively. both mbc50/mic50 and mbc90/mic90 ratios of levornidazole were 4, similar to those of metronidazole. levornidazole is an important anti-anaerobic option in clinical settings in terms of its potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity, bactericidal property, and the anti-anaerobic activity of its metabolites m1 and m4.

TI  == trends in the susceptibility of commonly encountered clinically significant anaerobes and susceptibilities of blood isolates of anaerobes to 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, 2008-2012, northern taiwan.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial resistance trends and profiles of clinical anaerobic isolates in northern taiwan. trends in the susceptibility of five commonly encountered clinical anaerobic isolates to seven agents from 2008 to 2012 were measured using the cochran-armitage trend test. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) of 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, against anaerobic blood isolates from two medical centers were determined using the agar dilution method. during the study period, susceptibility data on 11,105 isolates were evaluated. metronidazole and chloramphenicol retained excellent activities. around 20-30 % of isolates of bacteroides and prevotella species were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and clindamycin. of the 507 tested blood isolates, the rates of resistance to commonly used agents were much higher, namely, 16.2 % for  amoxicillin-clavulanate, 15.6 % for ampicillin-sulbactam, 24.7 % for cefmetazole, and 36.1 % for clindamycin. notably, 13.5 % of b. fragilis isolates were resistant to ertapenem. also, 15.2 % of b. uniformis, 17.2 % of other bacteroides species, 14.3 % of prevotella species, and 14 % of clostridium other than c. perfringens isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin. cefoperazone-sulbactam was active against most isolates, except for clostridium species other than perfringens (resistance rate, 18.6 %). fidaxomicin exerted poor activities against most anaerobes tested (mic90 of >128 mug/ml for b. fragilis and all isolates), except for c. perfringens (mic90 of 0.03 mug/ml) and peptostreptococcus micros (mic90 of 2 mug/ml). however, rifaximin showed a wide range of susceptibilities against the tested anaerobes (mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for b. fragilis). the emergence of resistance to ertapenem and moxifloxacin among bacteremic anaerobes highlights the need for continuous monitoring.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == alteration of predominant gastrointestinal flora and oxidative damage of large intestine under simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == hypobaric hypoxia is an immediate and crucial starting mechanism of acute mountain sickness included with some non-specific gastrointestinal (gi) complications. to study the effect of hypoxia on gi microflora and its upshot to  this system, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (air pressure ~ 4872.9 m altitude) consecutively 30 days for 8 hours/day. the different indicator group of large intestinal microbial populations were enumerated and correlated with the levels of antioxidant indicators like catalase (cat), superoxide dismutase (sod), malondialdehyde (mda), reduced glutathione (gsh) and oxidized glutathione (gssg)  of large intestinal epithelial cells. in addition, the histological study was performed by haematoxylin eosin (he), periodic acid schiff staining (pas) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). it was observed that the density of total aerobes (104 folds) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased but the population of total anaerobes (209 folds) and escherichia coli (125 folds) elevated after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium spp. (3 folds), bacteroides spp. (134 folds), lactobacillus spp. (7 folds) and other selected obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens (40 folds), peptostreptococcus spp. (21 folds) increased in respect to their control population. the growth direction index (gdi) of anaerobic populations was positive and correlated with gas formation aptitude. the activities of cat and sod in the large intestinal epithelia decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and gsh/gssg pool turned into oxidized state with higher mda (p < 0.05) formation. histological study revealed  the necrotized epithelial layer with higher lymphocytes infiltration in lamina propia accompanied by reduction of acidic mucins secreting goblet cells. from this experiment, it can be hypothesized that high altitude induced hypoxia manipulated the bacterial imprint and damaged the epithelial barrier of the large intestine which may cause systemic infection.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == dynamics of predominant microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract and change in luminal enzymes and immunoglobulin profile during high-altitude adaptation.
AB  == high-altitude (ha) visitors like pilgrims, trackers, scientists and military personnel face a group of nonspecific gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia. in order to investigate the alteration of indigenous gastrointestinal microbiota in the development of such gi symptoms, an experiment was conducted for the enumeration of dominant cultivable faecal microbiota of 15 soldiers at base level (delhi) and during their 15-day acclimatization at 3,505 m ha (leh). at ha, faecal microbiota analysis revealed that total aerobes decreased significantly with increase of total and facultative anaerobes. the strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroidetes sp. and lactobacillus sp. exhibited positive growth direction index (gdi) like other predominant obligate anaerobes clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. different enzymes like amylase, proteinase and polyphenol hydrolase produced by different bacterial populations showed positive gdi, whereas phosphatase producers exhibited negative gdi. the levels of microbe-originated enzymes like amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated during ha acclimatization. in addition, in vitro gas production ability  was enhanced with increase of faecal immunoglobulins iga and igg. we demonstrated that hypoxic environment at ha had the potential to alter the gut microbial composition and its activities that may cause gi dysfunctions.

TI  == population-based assessment of the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of anaerobic bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: anaerobes are a relatively uncommon but important cause of bloodstream infection. however, their epidemiology has not been well defined in non-selected populations. we sought to describe the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes associated with anaerobic bacteremia. methods: population-based surveillance for bacteremia with anaerobic microorganisms was conducted in the calgary area (population 1.2 million) during the period from 2000 to 2008. results: a total of 904 incident cases were identified, for an overall population incidence of 8.7 per 100,000 per year; 231 (26 %) were nosocomial, 300 (33 %) were healthcare-associated community-onset, and 373 (41 %) were community-acquired. elderly males were at the greatest risk. the most common pathogens identified were: bacteroides fragilis group (3.6 per 100,000), clostridium (non-perfringens) spp. (1.1 per 100,000), peptostreptococcus spp. (0.9 per 100,000), and clostridium perfringens (0.7 per 100,000). non-susceptibility to metronidazole was 2 %, to clindamycin 17 %, and to penicillin 42 %. relative to the general population, risk factors for anaerobic bloodstream infection included: male sex, increasing age, a prior diagnosis of cancer, chronic liver disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and/or hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure (hdcrf). the 30-day mortality was 20 %. increasing age, nosocomial acquisition, presence of malignancy, and several other co-morbid illnesses were independently associated with an increased risk of death. conclusion: anaerobic bloodstream infection is responsible for a significant burden of disease in general populations. the data herein establish the extent to which anaerobes contribute to morbidity and subsequent mortality. this information is key in developing preventative, empiric treatment and research priorities.

TI  == evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on  11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell  growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e.  faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == [relationship between clostridium difficile associated diarrhea and intestinal microecosystem disorder in patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].
AB  == this study was to investigate the relationship between clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (cdad) and intestinal microecosystem in patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-hsct) and to clarify clinical characteristics of intestinal microecosystem disorder. clostridium difficile (cd) was isolated and identified by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay using clostridium difficile premier toxins a&b kit and anaerobic culture in 44 cases with diarrhea. fecal flora (bifidobacteria, lactobacillus, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, and yeasts) of patients were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed by mitsuoka's methods. the results showed that cdad occurred after using antibiotic  or chemotherapy. clostridium difficile was detected in 12 patients with diarrhea  (positive rate was 27.27%). there was marked changes of intestinal microecosystem when patients suffered from cdad. the number of lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, enterobacteriaceae and so on decreased significantly. it was effective to treat cdad with vancomycin, metronidazole and probiotic, but the recurrence rate was 16.67%. in conclusion, cdad complicated by allo-hsct is related to change of intestinal microecosystem. while treating cdad with the sensitive antibiotic, the intestinal flora of patients should be supported actively. this treatment contributes to improving disease status and reducing diarrhea recurrence.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == in vitro activity of oritavancin (ly333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against clostridium perfringens, propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of gram-positive anaerobes. mic(90)s (microg/ml) for oritavancin were as follows: clostridium perfringens 1.0, propionibacterium acnes 0.25, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, finegoldia magna 0.25, micromonas. micros 0.25, and anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. on a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. the oritavancin mics are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing gram-positive anaerobes such as  these.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

TI  == [bacterial 16s rdna sequence analysis of siberian tiger faecal flora].
AB  == bacterial 16s rdna library of siberian tiger was developed and 15 different clones were obtained using ecor i and hind iii in restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. dna sequencing and similarity analysis showed that 10 clones matched corresponding clostridium sequences, of which 6 sequences had over 99% similarity with clostridium novyi type a, and 4 sequences had 97% similarity  with swine manure bacterium rt-18b, which identified as peptostreptococcus spp. the other five 16s rdna sequences had 94% - 95% similarity with clostridium pascui, clostridium tetani e88, clostridium sp. 14505 clostridium perfringens and carnobacterium sp. r-7279 respectively.

TI  == [comparison of the detection of anaerobic bacteria in haemoculture systems bactec lytic/10 anaerobic/f, bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic].
AB  == the purpose of this study is to deal with the problem of anaerobic cultivation of clinical specimens and consider the possibility of using semi-automated blood culture instruments. the bactec lytic, bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles were inoculated with bacteriodes fragilis, clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and feingoldia magna strains. the times to detection (ttd) for positive bottles were evaluated with reference to the number of inoculated bacteria. inoculation with the same suspension of equal  bacterial strain resulted in shorter ttd values for all the bactec lytic bottles  as compared with the bact/alert fan anaerobic or bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles, respectively. statistically significant differences were recorded (p=0,05) by bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens species. feingoldia magna was submitted to culture in the bactec lytic alone. the anaerobic blood culture bottles are deemed acceptable for application in the culture of anaerobc isolates drawn from other samples except for blood (namely when prompt delivery of the sample to the laboratory is impossible and the sample can suffer damage), however, only a limited range of microorganisms can be taken into account for the detection purposes. the bactec lytic bottles are more appropriately designed for  the detection of anaerobic bacterial species compared to the bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles. they achieve faster growth parametres and provide more successful readings of anaerobic bacteria culture and detection.

TI  == recovery of anaerobic bacteria from wounds after lawn-mower injuries.
AB  == accidental injury while using lawn mowers can cause serious infectious complications in the injured extremity. anaerobic bacteria were rarely recovered  from this infection. two children who sustained injury in their foot by a lawn mower developed severe wound infection. culture of the wound from 1 patient had heavy growth of clostridium bifermentans and peptostreptococcus magnus, and the culture from the other child grew clostridium perfringens. antimicrobial therapy  directed at the pathogens and vigorous surgical irrigation and debridement led to complete recovery from the infection. this report illustrates the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from children that had wound infection after lawn-mower injury.

TI  == in vitro activities of dalbavancin and nine comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacteria.
AB  == dalbavancin is a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide with enhanced activity against  gram-positive species. its comparative in vitro activities and those of nine comparator agents, including daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin, against 290 recent gram-positive clinical isolates strains, as determined by the nccls agar dilution method, were studied. the mics  of dalbavancin at which 90% of various isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: actinomyces spp., 0.5 microg/ml; clostridium clostridioforme, 8 microg/ml; c. difficile, 0.25 microg/ml; c. innocuum, 0.25 microg/ml; c. perfringens, 0.125 microg/ml; c. ramosum, 1 microg/ml; eubacterium spp., 1 microg/ml; lactobacillus spp., >32 microg/ml, propionibacterium spp., 0.5 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.25 microg/ml. dalbavancin was 1 to 3 dilutions more active than vancomycin against most strains. dalbavancin exhibited excellent activity against gram-positive strains tested and warrants clinical evaluation.

TI  == meningitis and shunt infection caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology and management of meningitis and shunt infections caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. the predominant anaerobes recovered in meningitis are bacteriodes spp., bacteriodes fragilis, fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. peptostreptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, propionibacterium acnes, and eubacterium are less commonly isolated. the predisposing conditions for meningitis are acute or chronic middle-ear infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pulmonary infections. in newborn and preterm infants  the predisposing conditions are rupture of membranes, amnionitis, fetal distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric perforation and subsequent ileus followed by bacteremia, aspiration pneumonitis and septicemia, infected ventriculoperitoneal  or ventriculoatrial shunt, and complicating dermal sinus tract infections. shunt  infection with propionibacterium spp. has been reported in children, especially in association with ventriculoauricular and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. clostridium perfringens has been recovered from infants with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. multiple-organism meningitis was reported as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts that perforated the gastrointestinal tract. early recognition and effective therapy are essential to recovery. management of meningitis includes the use of antimicrobials effective against anaerobes that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. these include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, and carbapenems. the treatment of shunt infection includes antimicrobial therapy and removal of the shunt.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == calibration of the disk diffusion test for trovafloxacin susceptibility testing of four anaerobic species.
AB  == objectives: to study trovafloxacin susceptibility among clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species using minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) determinations, e test assays and disk diffusion test results and to calibrate the disk diffusion method for these species using single strain regression analysis (sra). methods: one-hundred and eighty-seven clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species were included. trovafloxacin mic determinations were  performed using the agar dilution technique and mic estimations using the e test. the disk diffusion test was performed according to swedish reference group for antibiotics standardization. nccls limits for susceptibility categories were applied. sra was performed using 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 microg trovafloxacin disk  contents and atcc control strains. the regression lines obtained permitted the calculation of zone equivalents to mic limits as well as an evaluation of various disk potencies. results: trovafloxacin susceptibility (s + i) was noted in 98.9,  100, 100, and 97% of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus magnus strains, respectively, as  judged by mic determinations. agar dilution and e test estimations gave the same  results, but e test values were consistently lower than mic values by the reference method. regression lines calculated for the four species using sra showed different equation constants indicating species-related differences. interpretive zone diameter breakpoints were calculated for the four species and used for the interpretation of susceptibility. conclusions: the disk diffusion test was successfully calibrated for trovafloxacin susceptibility testing of four anaerobic species using single strain regression analysis, sra. there was a good  agreement between the results of mic-tests and disk testing. interpretive errors  of type i are prone to occur among bacteroides isolates and might require species-related mic limits. sra calculations permitted the testing of the effect  of different disk potencies on inhibition zones produced at the interpretive mic  limits. criteria for the selection of a minimal disk content showed that 5 microg trovafloxacin is sufficient, but a 10 microg disk will safeguard against residual laboratory variation without producing too large inhibition zones for very susceptible strains.

TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in auckland: 1991-1996.
AB  == aim: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of local anaerobic bacteria. method: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 357 obligate anaerobes collected between 1991 and 1997 was determined by a standard agar dilution method. isolates tested included bacteroides spp. 131, fusobacterium spp. 12, prevotella spp. 13,  veillonella spp. 5, clostridium perfringens 27, other clostridium spp. 29, propionibacterium spp. 57, actinomyces spp. 7, other non-sporing gram-positive bacilli 28 and peptostreptococcus spp. 48. ten antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. results: imipenem, pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were active against virtually all anaerobes tested. metronidazole was active against all anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and clostridium spp., but had variable activity against other anaerobes. cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against bacteroides spp., with 76%, 64% and 15% of bacteroides spp. being susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. penicillin had poor activity against anaerobic gram negative bacilli. actinomyces and propionibacterium spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except metronidazole. variable results were obtained with other antimicrobial-organism combinations. comparison of results with data from a previously published survey  showed little change in susceptibility except for increased resistance of bacteroides fragilis to ceftriaxone and clostridium species (not c perfringens) to clindamycin. conclusion: our results update the local susceptibility profile of anaerobic bacteria and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent  for prophylaxis or treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

AB  == the critical concentrations of sensitivity and resistance for meropenem versus anaerobic bacterias were analyzed. it is demonstrated the meropenem is a powerful inhibitor of the microorganisms of the bacteroides groups (mic90 < 1 mg/l), prevotella > porphyromonas, fusobacterium, veillonella, clostridium perfringens is inhibited at a mic < 0.06 mg/l. the mic of meropenem versus c. difficile is 2  mg/l. they are also highly susceptible to the propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus and peptococcus type microorganisms. meropenem is comparable to imipenem and is more active than piperacillin, metronidazole and clindamycin.  the mechanism of action and acquisition of resistance versus meropenem is evaluated and discussed. the percentage of highly resistant strains (mic > 256 mg/l) isolated in the hospital gregorio maranon in madrid (spain) is low (1.2%).  the influence of ph on the in vitro activity of the carbapenemicos is also analyzed providing experimental data suggesting that meropenem maintains its bactericide activity more effectively in low ph conditions (5.6). finally, the authors analyze the literature and the evidence reported regarding the use of meropenem in clinical practice, as a treatment of intraabdominal infections with  a clinical response of 91%-100% and bacteriologic efficacy of 84%-95%.

TI  == time-kill study of the activity of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam  against six anaerobes.
AB  == a time-kill method was developed to examine the killing kinetics of trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium  mortiferum, peptostreptococcus magnus and clostridium perfringens. solutions and  suspensions were prepared inside an anaerobic glove box, using syringes and prereduced broth. bottles were then incubated outside the chamber and viability counts determined after incubation for 0, 6, 24 and 48 h in a shaking water bath, avoiding introduction of air. bacteriostatic/bactericidal concentrations (mg/l) after 48 h for the six strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.03-1/0.03-1; ciprofloxacin, 0.25-16/0.25-32; sparfloxacin, 0.06-2/0.06-8; metronidazole 1-64/1-64; cefoxitin, 0.125-16/0.125-32; piperacillin, 0.125-64/0.125-64; piperacillin/tazobactam, 0.06-2/0.125-8. bacteriostatic levels were within two dilutions of broth mics. by this time-kill method, trovafloxacin had the lowest bacteriostatic concentrations of all compounds tested.

TI  == emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in south korea.
AB  == in previous studies, bacteroides fragilis group organisms isolated from korean patients were more frequently resistant to various antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, than were isolates in other countries. a recent report of  increased resistance of peptostreptococcus species prompted us to include such isolates in a study of antimicrobial susceptibility. anaerobes isolated in 1994 at a tertiary care hospital in seoul were tested by agar dilution method. none of the b. fragilis group organisms were resistant to imipenem, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole. however, 6.7% were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, 20.2% to cefotetan, 30.3% to piperacillin, 48.3% to cefotaxime, and 42.7% to clindamycin. almost all of the clostridium perfringens isolates were susceptible to all of the agents tested, except tetracycline. peptostreptococcus isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem, while 7.4% were resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole, and 25.9% were resistant to clindamycin. the isolates resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole were identified as peptostreptococcus  anaerobius. in conclusion, besides the well-known high rate of resistance of b. fragilis group organisms to clindamycin, the emergence of resistance of peptostreptococcus species isolates to beta-lactam drugs has become obvious in korea.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin (ro 09-1168) against strictly anaerobic bacteria and some bacteria from human fecal flora].
AB  == as recommended by the eec, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. thus, the mics for marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (norma nccls m11 a3) using wilkins chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and mueller hinton agar for e. coli, proteus, enterococcus and lactobacillus. on the whole aerobes, the activity of marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. the modal mic was 0.03 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for enterococcus and lactobacillus strains, respectively. considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug,  in comparison with that of ofloxacin, mics for ofloxacin were generally one log2  higher for gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for gram positive bacilli. modal mics for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the b. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for c. difficile strains, respectively. it appears in  vitro that marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay y 3118, and nine other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone, was determined against 257 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activities of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and ornidazole. overall, bay y 3118  was the most active agent tested against the bacteroides fragilis group. its activity (mic90, 0.5 mg/l) was 16-fold lower than that of sparfloxacin (mic90, 8  mg/l), and more than 100-fold lower than that of ofloxacin (mic90, 64 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 128 mg/l) against the group. no strains belonging to this group were resistant to metronidazole (mics range, 0.12-2 mg/l) and ornidazole (mics range, 0.12-4 mg/l). bay y 3118 was more active than those quinolones against prevotella and porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and c. difficile (mic90, 0.12, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). the activity of bay y 3118 against peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 1 mg/l) was slightly lower than that of the other gram-positive bacteria tested.  in general, bay y 3118 was more active than cefoxitin, and it was superior to antianaerobic chemical agents like metronidazole, ornidazole and clindamycin. pharmacokinetic and clinical trials are required to define the role of bay y 3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

TI  == anaerobic susceptibility testing. slight differences in inoculum size can make a  difference in minimum inhibitory concentrations.
AB  == in the present study, we compared the actual inoculum density from inoculated broth microdilution wells to the targeted inoculum size (10(5) cfu/well) when the inoculum was prepared using a mcfarland nephelometer to achieve the standard density. three target inoculum sizes (10(5), 5 x 10(5), and 10(6) cfu/well) were  used to compare the effect of slight inoculum size increases of both atcc and clinical strains of anaerobes on mics of various antimicrobials. actual colony counts of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, eubacterium lentum, and veillonella parvula ranged from 0.7 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(5) cfu/well. as the inoculum size rose above the desired 10(5) cfu/well level, the mics of certain antimicrobials became elevated. ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone mics rose 4- to 16-fold with as little as 0.5 log10 increase in inoculum size. other increases were also noted with e. lentum and clostridium perfringens, but were primarily between the low and high inoculum sizes. results with cefoxitin, cefotetan, mezlocillin, and imipenem did not show an appreciable increased inoculum effect. this study demonstrates that the variation in organism size among anaerobes (both between species and within species) does make a difference  in actual inoculum size and certain anaerobes may require special adjustment to ensure proper mic results from susceptibility testing.

TI  == 16s ribosomal dna sequences of anaerobic cocci and proposal of ruminococcus hansenii comb. nov. and ruminococcus productus comb. nov.
AB  == the 16s ribosomal dna sequences of representative members of the family peptococcaceae were determined. the members of the family examined were divided into the following four phylogenetic groups: peptococcus niger atcc 27731t (t = type strain), the sarcina-peptostreptococcus anaerobius group, the ruminococcus-coprococcus group, and the peptostreptococcus group. peptococcus niger, the type species of the family, was not related to other members of the family. peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc 27337t, the type strain of the type species of the genus peptostreptococcus, was closely related to clostridium sordellii ncib 10717t (level of sequence similarity, 85%). sarcina ventriculi gifu 7886, a spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive coccus, clustered with clostridium perfringens atcc 13124t at a similarity value of 91%. members of the  sarcina-peptostreptococcus anaerobius group clustered with clostridia at similarity values ranging from 85 to 91%. the type strains of peptostreptococcus  prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus magnus clustered at levels of sequence homology of 84 to 93%.  this cluster was not included in the peptococcus niger group or the peptostreptococcus anaerobius group. thus, these members of the genus peptostreptococcus should be separated from the other members of the genus and also from members of the family peptococcaceae. the sequence of peptostreptococcus productus atcc 27340t was different from the sequences of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus niger. the sequence of streptococcus hansenii atcc 27752t, a strictly anaerobic strain, was different from the sequences of other streptococci; this strain clustered with peptostreptococcus productus, coprococci, and ruminococci. several phenotypic characteristics of streptococcus hansenii atcc 27752t were similar to characteristics of ruminococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora of male beagle dogs in two different age groups;  i) less than month 12 of age, and ii) more than year 11 of age, was compared. no  detectable difference occurred on the microflora of stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in both dogs. large bowel (cecum, colon and rectum) microflora in both  dogs yielded the different microbial populations. in all regions of large bowel,  the levels of bacteroides, eubacteria, peptostreptococci, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and staphylococci in the elderly dogs were lower than those in the  younger animals, whereas the numbers of clostridium perfringens and streptococci  in the elderly animals were higher than those in the youngers. the high incidence of lecithinase-negative clostridia was observed with advances in age, but not that of spiral shaped rods. the result of this study shows that the advances in age of beagle dogs yield some changes in the microbial population of large bowel  in the animals.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nosocomial infections of ocular conjunctiva in newborns delivered by cesarian section.
AB  == colonization of the ocular conjunctiva in newborns delivered by cesarian section  occurs usually within the first day of life. we have studied the flora of the ocular conjunctiva at birth, from 19 newborns delivered by cesarian section, coming from two different maternity hospitals. ocular conjunctiva cultures yielded the main predominant flora in both maternity hospitals considered. the most common genus of this flora are: staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium acnes. peptostreptococcus productus, neisseria, eubacterium and clostridium perfringens are isolated occasionally. in newborns delivered by cesarian section, this flora principally acquired may be the consequence of the presence of bacteria in the ambient air, as well as differences in care provided  by the nosocomial personnel.

TI  == comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin g against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == in vitro activity of u-57930e against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of u-57930e, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. the mic (micrograms/ml) of u-57930e that inhibited 95% bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus prevotii, b. melaninogenicus and  p. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, b. vulgatus, propionibacterium and peptococcus species. clindamycin, on the other hand, gave mic values of 0.5 microgram/ml for b. fragilis, p. prevotii and p. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for propionibacterium sp. all strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of u-57930e. both clindamycin and  u-57930e showed similar mic values for all strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes tested. the mic values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and  tetracycline were within the expected range. u-57930e had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower mic than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

AB  == a survey for anaerobic bacteria was conducted in 314 clinical specimens from dogs and cats. a total of 187 anaerobic isolates in pure and mixed culture were isolated from 111 of the specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria. common isolated included actinomyces (9.1%), clostridium perfringens (19.3%), other clostridium spp (11.2%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (7.5%), bacteroides melaninogenicus (13.4%), other bacteroides spp (17.6%), and fusobacterium necrophorum (5.3%). anaerobic bacteria were involved in serious lesions that often were life threatening to the animals. antibiotic susceptibility data indicated that the lincomycin family, the penicillin family, chloramphenicol, and cephaloridine are preferred drugs for treatment of anaerobic infections. data from the survey were used in formulation of a table to aid practitioners in clinical diagnosis of disease caused by anaerobes. clostridium perfringens was isolated in large numbers from five of six dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and from one cat with hemorrhagic diarrhea. experimental infections were induced in rats, using caine feces as inoculum. induced lesions contained aerobic and anaerobic bacteria similar to those bacteria isolated in the clinical survey, indicating that feces may serve as a major source of these bacteria in clinical infections of the dog.

AB  == meconium samples obtained from 14 children aged 18 to 51 h were subjected to a quantitative differential analysis. the meconium of one of the children (47 h old) was sterile; in those of the 11 infants aged less than 47 h the dominant flora was composed of either enterobacteria, mainly escherichia coli sensitive to usual antibiotics, or of streptococci. the genus acinetobacter constituted the dominant flora in one case only. staphylococcus, corynebacterium, clostridium (c. perfringens), bacteroides, peptococcus, when present in the meconium, represented a very small proportion of the total flora. in the two children aged 48 h and more, the flora was more complex and bacteroides, bifidobacterium, veillonella, peptostreptococcus, clostridium and staphylococcus were associated to streptococci and enterobacteria. a very small number of lactobacilli was found in one child only. no yeasts were detected. the sequence of establishment of the various bacteria was studied in a child (og) by an analysis of 8 samples obtained between 0 and 74 h after its birth. e. coli and streptococcus became established  24 h after parturition, bifidobacterium and bacteroides the 2nd and 3rd day, respectively. lactobacillus and peptococcus were only present in very low number  in the first 2 meconium samples and did not become established in the child, although they were present in a rather large number in the vaginal and faecal samples from the mother. in addition, use of axenic mice inoculated with the 3rd  meconium from the infant og revealed the existence of certain genera of bacteria  probably of faecal origin which had not been detected by the direct analysis of the meconium. these genera did not become established in the child. the hypothesis according to which the meconium chooses among the fortuitous contaminations before true colonization of the digestive tract is established, is discussed. it was also observed that the evolution of the ratio between the number of e. coli and proteus morganii in the successive samples obtained from og was very different from that observed in the mice inoculated with these samples.

TI  == factors related to the oxygen tolerance of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the effect of atmospheric oxygen on the viability of 13 strains of anaerobic bacteria, two strains of facultative bacteria, and one aerobic organism was examined. there were great variations in oxygen tolerance among the bacteria. all facultative bacteria survived more than 72 h of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. the survival time for anaerobes ranged from less than 45 min for peptostreptococcus anaerobius to more than 72 h for two clostridium perfringens strains. an effort was made to relate the degree of oxygen tolerance to the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases in cell-free extracts of the bacteria. all facultative bacteria and a number of anaerobic bacteria possessed superoxide dismutase. there was a correlation between superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen tolerance, but there were notable exceptions. polyacrylamide gel electropherograms stained for superoxide dismutase indicated that many of the anaerobic bacteria contained at least two electrophoretically distinct enzymes with superoxide dismutase activity. all facultative bacteria contained peroxidase, whereas none of the anaerobic bacteria possessed measurable amounts of this enzyme. catalase activity was variable among the bacteria and showed no relationship to oxygen tolerance. the ability of the bacteria to reduce oxygen was also examined and related to enzyme content and oxygen tolerance. in general, organisms that survived for relatively long periods of time in the presence of oxygen but demonstrated little superoxide dismutase activity reduced little oxygen. the effects of medium composition and conditions  of growth were examined for their influence on the level of the three enzymes. bacteria grown on the surface of an enriched blood agar medium generally had more enzyme activity than bacteria grown in a liquid medium. the data indicate that superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen reduction rates are important determinants related to the tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria in routine urine culture.
AB  == one hundred and fifty-eight anaerobic organisms from 147 patients were isolated from 15,250 consecutive clean mid-stream or catheter urine specimens. the pathogenicity of the anaerobic genera commonly isolated from urine is reviewed and discussed. failure to establish anaerobic isolates as pathogens and a paucity of reported cases proving anaerobic bacteria as significant causes of urinary tract infection permitted discontinuation of anaerobic culture as part of the routine screening procedure for investigation of urinary tract infections.
