TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == the relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.
