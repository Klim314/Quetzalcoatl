TI  - Characterization of Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD) from Lactobacillus sakei A156 Isolated from Jeot-gal.
AB  - A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing microorganism was isolated from jeot-gal (anchovy), a Korean fermented seafood. The isolate, A156, produced GABA profusely when incubated in MRS broth with monosodium glutamate (3% (w/v)) at 37 degrees C for 48 h. A156 was identified as Lactobacillus sakei by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The GABA conversion yield was 86% as determined by GABase enzyme assay. The gadB gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) was cloned by PCR. gadC encoding a glutamate/GABA antiporter was located immediately upstream of gadB. The operon structure of gadCB was confirmed by RT-PCR. gadB was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and recombinant GAD was purified. The purified GAD was 54.4 kDa in size by SDS-PAGE. Maximum GAD activity was observed at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C and the activity was dependent on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The Km and Vmax of GAD were 0.045 mM and 0.011 mM/min, respectively, when glutamate was used as the substrate.
TI  - The Cyclic Antibacterial Peptide Enterocin AS-48: Isolation, Mode of Action, and  Possible Food Applications.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus. It contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The conformation of enterocin AS-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. Enterocin AS-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on Gram-positive bacteria. Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. Eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. This cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. Microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in Bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. Enterocin AS-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. The potential applications of enterocin AS-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp., Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). The efficacy of enterocin AS-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high hydrostatic pressure.
TI  - Detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 isolated from freshwater fish: Bacteriocin from Lb. brevis FPTLB3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 AU/ml) against Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729, Lactobacillus casei MTCC 1423, Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees C for 60 min and declined thereafter. Stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at pH range of 2.0 to 8.0. Its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. Mitomycin C and UV light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. Exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except Nonidet P-40, which led to total loss of activity. No bacteriocin adsorption was detected at pH 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at pH 6.5. Based on Tricine SDS-PAGE the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kDa. No plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
TI  - Quantification and efficiency of Lactobacillus sakei strain mixtures used as protective cultures in ground beef.
AB  - Lactobacillus sakei is a lactic acid bacterium, naturally associated with long term storage of fresh meat at low temperature. Here we investigated the effect, on the evolution of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in ground beef, of L. sakei cocktails used as bioprotective cultures. We selectively developed a real time quantitative PCR method, allowing the quantification of individual L. sakei strains inoculated in ground meat with specific probes. Six cocktails of three strains were tested to evaluate their effect on the growth of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Brochothrix thermosphacta at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C, under vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging. Using plating methods to quantify the different bacterial species, one cocktail showed an effect against S. Typhimurium and E. coli under given conditions. Real time quantitative PCR showed that the three inoculated L. sakei strains had a different growth pattern, and that the association of these three strains indeed impaired growth of S. Typhimurium and E. coli.
TI  - Characterization by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods of the bacterial population of suckling-lamb packaged in different atmospheres.
AB  - This study offers insight into the dynamics of bacterial populations in fresh cuts of suckling lamb under four different atmospheric conditions: air (A), and three Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) environments, 15%O2/30%CO2/55%N2 (C, commercial), 70%O2/30%CO2 (O), and 15%O2/85%CO2 (H) for 18 days. Microbial analyses by both conventional methods and PCR-DGGE were performed. Controversial and surprising results emerged from comparing both methods in relation to the genus Pseudomonas. Thus, conventional methods detected the presence of high numbers of Pseudomonas colonies, although PCR-DGGE only detected this genus in air-packaged samples. PCR-DGGE detected higher microbial diversity in the control samples (A) than in the modified atmospheres (C, O, H), having atmosphere H the fewest number of species. Brochothrix thermosphacta, LAB (Carnobacterium divergens and Lactobacillus sakei), and Escherichia spp. were detected in all the atmospheres throughout storage. Moreover, previously undescribed bacteria from lamb meat such as Enterobacter hormaechei, Staphylococcus equorum and Jeotgalicoccus spp. were also isolated in this study by DGGE. Additionally, qPCR analysis was used to detect and characterize strains of Escherichia coli. Virulence genes (stx1, stx2 and eae) were detected throughout storage in 97% of the samples. A high CO2 atmosphere was the most effective packaging combination doubling storage time in comparison with commercial atmosphere.
TI  - Inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in liquid broth medium and during processing of fermented sausage using autochthonous starter cultures.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of two autochthonous starter cultures of Lactobacillus sakei was evaluated in vitro (in liquid broth medium) and in situ assays. The inactivation of foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes (serotype 4ab No 10) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888 was investigated during the production of fermented sausage according to a typical Greek recipe using L. sakei strains as starter cultures. The inactivation kinetics were modeled using GInaFiT, a freeware tool to assess microbial survival curves. By the end of the ripening period, the inhibition of L. monocytogenes was significant in treatments with L. sakei 8416 and L. sakei 4413 compared to the control treatment. A 2.2-log reduction of the population of E. coli O157:H7 resulted from the autochthonous starter culture L. sakei 4413 during sausage processing. The use of the autochthonous starter cultures constitutes an additional improvement to the microbial safety by reducing foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Correlation between body mass index and gut concentrations of Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium animalis, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genus and species level analysis is the best way to characterize alterations in the human gut microbiota that are associated with obesity, because the clustering of obese and lean microbiotas increases with the taxonomic depth of the analysis. Bifidobacterium genus members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different Lactobacillus species are associated both with a lean and an obese status. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We analyzed the fecal concentrations of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Methanobrevibacter smithii, the genus Lactobacillus, five other Lactobacillus species previously linked with lean or obese populations, Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium animalis in 263 individuals, including 134 obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 anorexic subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index (BMI). Of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous study. FINDINGS: Firmicutes were found in >98.5%, Bacteroidetes in 67%, M. smithii in 64%, E. coli in 51%, Lactobacillus species between 17 and 25% and B. animalis in 11% of individuals. The fecal concentration of Lactobacillus reuteri was positively correlated with BMI (coefficient=0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.58; P=0.02) in agreement with what was reported for Lactobacillus sakei. As reported, B. animalis (coefficient=-0.84; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.07; P=0.03) and M. smithii (coefficient=-0.43, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.05; P=0.08) were negatively associated with the BMI. Unexpectedly, E. coli was found here for the first time to negatively correlate with the BMI (coefficient=-1.05; 95% CI -1.60 to -0.50; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the specificity of the obese microbiota and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain Lactobacillus species and obesity.
TI  - A hydrolase from Lactobacillus sakei moonlights as a transaminase.
AB  - Enzymatic transamination of amino acids yields alpha-keto acids and is the initial step for the production of volatile compounds that contribute to the sensory perception of fermented foods such as salami. Lactobacillus sakei is one of the lactic acid bacterial strains commonly used in starter cultures. Although the genome sequence of L. sakei 23K lacks genes encoding typical branched-chain amino acid transaminases, transamination activity and the formation of amino acid-derived volatile metabolites could be demonstrated. A protein purified from L. sakei is held responsible for the transamination activity. By heterologous expression of the corresponding gene in Escherichia coli, we were able to characterize the transamination side activity of an enzyme annotated as a putative acylphosphatase (AcP). A transamination side activity of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was also discovered. Both enzymes showed substrate specificity toward branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. AcP also accepted l-methionine. Activity was optimal at neutral pH for both enzymes, whereas AcP showed a significantly higher temperature optimum (55 degrees C) than that of HEWL (37 degrees C). Kinetic parameters revealed high affinity toward l-leucine for AcP (K(m) = 1.85 mM) and toward l-isoleucine for HEWL (K(m) = 3.79 mM). AcP seems to play a major role in the metabolism of amino acids in L. sakei.
TI  - Catabolism of N-acetylneuraminic acid, a fitness function of the food-borne lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus sakei, involves two newly characterized proteins.
AB  - In silico analysis of the genome sequence of the meat-borne lactic acid bacterium (LAB) Lactobacillus sakei 23K has revealed a repertoire of potential functions related to the adaptation of this bacterium to the meat environment. Among these functions, the ability to use N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (NANA) as a carbon source could provide a competitive advantage for growth on meat in which this amino sugar is present. In this work, we proposed to analyze the functionality of a gene cluster encompassing nanTEAR and nanK (nanTEAR-nanK). We established that this cluster encoded a pathway allowing transport and early steps of the catabolism of NANA in this genome. We also demonstrated that this cluster was absent from the genome of other L. sakei strains that were shown to be unable to grow on NANA. Moreover, L. sakei 23K nanA, nanT, nanK, and nanE genes were able to complement Escherichia coli mutants. Construction of different mutants in L. sakei 23K DeltananR, DeltananT, and DeltananK and the double mutant L. sakei 23K Delta(nanA-nanE) made it possible to show that all were impaired for growth on NANA. In addition, two genes located downstream from nanK, lsa1644 and lsa1645, are involved in the catabolism of sialic acid in L. sakei 23K, as a L. sakei 23K Deltalsa1645 mutant was no longer able to grow on NANA. All these results demonstrate that the gene cluster nanTEAR-nanK-lsa1644-lsa1645 is indeed involved in the use of NANA as an energy source by L. sakei.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Cloning and heterologous expression of a bacteriocin sakacin P from Lactobacillus sakei in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Sakacin P, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus sakei, shows strong activity against  food-borne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. In L. sakei, the structural gene (sppA) encoding sakacin P is controlled by a strict regulatory mechanism, and the quantity of secreted sakacin P is limited. In this study, the sppA gene was synthesized by splicing overlap extension PCR and cloned into Escherichia coli. After the induction with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the recombinant sakacin P was successfully expressed. The collected cells were sonicated, and the activity was detected by agar diffusion method. The results also showed that the low-temperature induction can improve the activity of sakacin P.
TI  - Bio-control of waterborne pathogens using Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - Bacteria play a significant role in water contamination. Chemicals are mostly used for the treatment of bacteriologically contaminated water. The use of bacterial interactions is a new approach to limit the pathogens' growth. Detection of antimicrobial substances produced by lactic acid bacteria against the waterborne pathogens is the objective of this work. Microbiological and biochemical methods were used to identify lactic acid bacteria having an antimicrobial activity. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity with growth kinetic measurements was performed. Four isolates of lactic acid bacteria obtained from whey and curd were identified. The predominant species belonging to the Lactobacillus genera are: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Lactobacillus paraplantarum. The present study revealed that the Lactobacillus consortium is able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus's growth along with Escherichia coli and Vibrio species. In mixed culture, after 24 h, the Lactobacillus consortium reduces the growth of S. aureus by 2.03 log; moreover, the growth of the latter bacteria totally ceased after 72 h of incubation. The protein produced by the Lactobacillus consortium was responsible for arresting the growth of S. aureus.
TI  - Characterization of a heterodimeric GH2 beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus sakei Lb790 and formation of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides.
AB  - The lacLM genes from Lactobacillus sakei Lb790, encoding a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family GH2, were cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli . Subsequently, the recombinant beta-galactosidase LacLM was purified to apparent homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme is a beta-galactosidase with narrow substrate specificity because o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (oNPG) was efficiently hydrolyzed, whereas various structurally related oNP analogues were not. The K(m) and k(cat) values for oNPG and lactose were 0.6 mM and 180 s(-1) and 20 mM and 43 s(-1), respectively. The enzyme is inhibited competitively by its two end-products D-galactose and D-glucose (K(i) values of 180 and 475 mM, respectively). As judged by the ratio of the inhibition constant to the Michaelis constant, K(i)/K(m), this inhibition is only very moderate and much less pronounced than for other microbial beta-galactosidases. beta-Galactosidase from L. sakei possesses high transgalactosylation activity and was used for the synthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides (GalOS), employing lactose at a concentration of 215 g/L. The maximum GalOS yield was 41% (w/w) of total sugars at 77% lactose conversion and contained mainly non-lactose disaccharides, trisaccharides, and tetrasaccharides with approximately 38, 57, and 5% of total GalOS formed, respectively. The enzyme showed a strong preference for the formation of beta-(1-->6)-linked transgalactosylation products, whereas beta-(1-->3)-linked compounds were formed to a lesser extent and beta-(1-->4)-linked reaction products could not be detected.
TI  - In vitro synthesis of biogenic amines by Brochothrix thermosphacta isolates from  meat and meat products and the influence of other microorganisms.
AB  - Twenty Brochothrix thermosphacta strains tested for biogenic amines (BAs) production, formed histamine (6.6-16.2 mg/kg) and tyramine (18.7-35.4 mg/kg) but neither putrescine nor cadaverine. Six of the twenty strains were also investigated in respect of their influence on the synthesis of BAs by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Proteus mirabilis and Lactobacillus sakei. In pure culture Escherichia coli produced all of the studied amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) with a total concentration of 167.7 mg/kg, P. mirabilis produced a total of 56.7 mg/kg histamine, tyramine and cadaverine, while Lactobacillus sakei and Pseudomonas sp. produced histamine and tyramine, totaling 37.9 and 35.2 mg/kg respectively. All B. thermosphacta promoted cadaverine production by Escherichia coli which increased by 12-68%, and some of them contributed to the appearance of this amine among the metabolites of Pseudomonas. The presence of B. thermosphacta decreased the potential ability of P. mirabilis to produce BAs.
TI  - Construction and evaluation of shuttle vector, pGYC4alpha, based on pYC2 from Lactobacillus sakei.
AB  - The shuttle vector pGYC4alpha (6,157 bp) was constructed based on the sigma-replicon plasmid pYC2 from Lactobacillus sakei BM5 isolated from kimchi. The vector contained inserts of the ColE1 replicon, alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus licheniformis containing its own signal peptide, and lactococcal promoter P32. Transformation and expression of a selection marker gene (alpha-amylase) with pGYC4alpha were demonstrated in Escherichia coli and several lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The highest alpha-amylase activity in LAB transformants was obtained in M17/0.25% glucose media with 0.5% CaCO(3). The segregational stability of the shuttle vector in LAB was 100% for more than 100 generations in the absence of antibiotic pressure. The developed vector might be useful as a genetic tool for food industries.
TI  - The acid tolerant L-arabinose isomerase from the food grade Lactobacillus sakei 23K is an attractive D-tagatose producer.
AB  - The araA gene encoding an L-arabinose isomerase (L-AI) from the psychrotrophic and food grade Lactobacillus sakei 23K was cloned, sequenced and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of nearly 220 kDa, suggesting it is a tetramer of four 54 kDa monomers. The enzyme is distinguishable from previously reported L-AIs by its high activity and stability at temperatures from 4 to 40 degrees C, and pH from 3 to 8, and by its low metal requirement of only 0.8 mM Mn(2+) and 0.8 mM Mg(2+) for its maximal activity and thermostability. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that this enzyme displays a high catalytic efficiency allowing D-galactose bioconversion rates of 20% and 36% at 10 and 45 degrees C, respectively, which are useful for commercial production of D-tagatose.
TI  - High-level expression of heme-dependent catalase gene katA from Lactobacillus Sakei protects Lactobacillus rhamnosus from oxidative stress.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), Lactobacillus sakei YSI8 is one of the very few LAB strains able to degrade H(2)O(2) through the action of a heme-dependent catalase. Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains are very important probiotic starter cultures in meat product fermentation, but they are deficient in catalase. In this study, the effect of heterologous expression of L. sakei catalase gene katA in L. rhamnosus on its oxidative stress resistance was tested. The recombinant L. rhamnosus AS 1.2466 was able to decompose H(2)O(2) and the catalase activity reached 2.85 mumol H(2)O(2)/min/10(8) c.f.u. Furthermore, the expression of the katA gene in L. rhamnosus conferred enhanced oxidative resistance on the host. The survival ratios after short-term H(2)O(2) challenge were increased 600 and 10(4)-fold at exponential and stationary phase, respectively. Further, viable cells were 100-fold higher in long-term aerated cultures. Simulation experiment demonstrated that both growth and catalase activity of recombinant L. rhamnosus displayed high stability under environmental conditions similar to those encountered during sausage fermentation.
TI  - Antimicrobial compounds produced by Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a, a bacteriocinogenic strain isolated from a Brazilian meat product.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria are gaining increased importance due to their activity against undesirable microorganisms in foods. In this study, a concentrated acid extract of a culture of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a, a bacteriocinogenic strain isolated from a Brazilian pork product, was purified by cation exchange and reversed-phase chromatographic methods. The amino acid sequences of the active antimicrobial compounds determined by Edman degradation were compared to known protein sequences using the BLAST-P software. Three different antimicrobial compounds were obtained, P1, P2 and P3, and mass spectrometry indicated molecular masses of 4.4, 6.8 and 9.5 kDa, respectively. P1 corresponds to classical sakacin P, P2 is identical to the 30S ribosomal protein S21 of L. sakei subsp. sakei 23 K, and P3 is identical to a histone-like DNA-binding protein HV produced by L. sakei subsp. sakei 23 K. Total genomic DNA was extracted and used as target DNA for PCR amplification of the genes sak, lis and his involved in the synthesis of P1, P2 and P3. The fragments were cloned in pET28b expression vector and the resulting plasmids transformed in E. coli KRX competent cells. The transformants were active against Listeria monocytogenes, indicating that the activity of the classical sakacin P produced by L. sakei 2a can be complemented by other antimicrobial proteins.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of raw milk and soft cheese and detection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria with antagonistic activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Spp., and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study aimed to characterize the microbiological quality and safety of raw milk and soft cheese, verifying possible associations between microbial populations, and the detection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens. Raw milk (n = 36) and soft cheese (n = 18) samples were collected and submitted for the analysis of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, LAB, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (CPS), Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. In all, 389 LAB isolates were randomly selected and submitted for antagonistic tests against L. monocytogenes, St. aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Lactobacillus sakei. The samples presented high counts of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, and LAB, and also high and significant correlation indices between these populations. Low levels of CPS and E. coli were observed, as well as an absence of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes. A substantial portion of the analyzed samples presented LAB cultures with antagonistic activity, but not against Salmonella Typhimurium. The obtained results indicate the antimicrobial potential of the autochthonous microbiota of raw milk and soft cheese. Despite the spoilage potential, the LAB present in the studied food products can be isolated and properly characterized as antagonistic cultures, to be used in bioconservation studies for pathogen control in foods.
TI  - Inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from African indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. Escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by Staphylococcus spp. (20%). The Gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the Staphylococcus spp. showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. Twenty-four LAB isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. LAB strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller groups through amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Representative strains were identified as Weissella spp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16S rDNA. The Weissella spp. and L. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity against seven strains of Gram negative uropathogens. Two strains of L. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against Lactobacillus sakei. In this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west Nigeria was discovered. Based on their sensitivity to Weissella spp., there is a potential for using these LAB as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.
TI  - Class II one-peptide bacteriocins target a phylogenetically defined subgroup of mannose phosphotransferase systems on sensitive cells.
AB  - Membrane-located proteins (IIC and IID) of the mannose-phosphotransferase system  (man-PTS) have previously been shown to serve as target receptors for several bacteriocins. Although many bacteria contain at least one such man-PTS in their genome, most bacteriocins display a narrow inhibitory spectrum, targeting predominantly bacteria closely related to the producers. In the present study we have analysed the receptor spectrum of one-peptide bacteriocins of class II. A phylogenetic analysis of 86 man-PTSs from a wide range of bacterial genera grouped the man-PTSs into three main clusters (groups I-III). Fourteen man-PTSs distributed across the phylogenetic tree were selected for experimental analysis in a heterologous host. Only members of group I could serve as receptors for class IIa bacteriocins, and the receptor efficiencies varied in a pattern directly related to their phylogenetic position. A multiple sequence alignment of IIC and IID proteins revealed three sequence regions (two in IIC and one in IID) that distinguish members of the bacteriocin-susceptible group from those of the other groups, suggesting that these amino acid regions confer the specific bacteriocin receptor function. Moreover, we demonstrated that variation in sensitivity might also exist within the same species due to differential expression levels of the receptor, since three strains of Lactobacillus sakei harbouring identical man-PTSs were shown to display different expression levels of a man-PTS gene that corresponded to the variation in bacteriocin sensitivity. Together, the results of our study show that the level of bacteriocin susceptibility for a bacterial cell is primarily determined by differences in its man-PTS proteins, although the expression levels of the corresponding genes also play an important role.
TI  - Behavior of the meat-borne bacterium Lactobacillus sakei during its transit through the gastrointestinal tracts of axenic and conventional mice.
AB  - A Lactobacillus sakei strain named FLEC01 was isolated from human feces and characterized genotypically. Comparison of the genetic features of this strain with those of both the meat-borne L. sakei strain 23K and another human isolate, LTH5590, showed that they belong to different but closely related clusters. The three L. sakei strains did not persist and only transited through the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of conventional C3H/HeN mice. In contrast, they all colonized the GITs of axenic mice and rapidly reached a population of 10(9) CFU/g of feces, which remained stable until day 51. Five days after mice were fed, a first subpopulation, characterized by small colonies, appeared and reached 50% of the total L. sakei population in mice. Fifteen to 21 days after feeding, a second subpopulation, characterized by rough colonies, appeared. It coexisted with the two other populations until day 51, and its cell shapes were also affected, suggesting a dysfunction of the cell division or cell wall. No clear difference between the behaviors of the meat-borne strain and the two human isolates in both conventional and axenic mice was observed, suggesting that L. sakei is a food-borne bacterium rather than a commensal one and that its presence in human feces originates from diet. Previous observations of Escherichia coli strains suggest that the mouse GIT environment could induce mutations to increase their survival and colonization capacities. Here, we observed similar mutations concerning a food-grade gram-positive bacterium for the first time.
TI  - Evaluation of potential for inhibition of growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and  multidrug-resistant Salmonella serovars in raw beef by addition of a presumptive Lactobacillus sakei ground beef isolate.
AB  - The efficacy of adding presumptive Lactobacillus sakei (LS) strain 10-EGR-a, the  most inhibitory from among 12 ground beef Lactobacillus isolates, to inhibit growth by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella (serovars Newport and Typhimurium) was evaluated in a beef-derived broth medium at 10 degrees C and in fresh raw ground beef at 10 and 5 degrees C. Pathogen inhibition was observed in the broth medium at both high (10(8):10(5) to 10(7):10(5)) and low (10(6):10(5) to 10(5):10(5)) LS:pathogen ratios. After 9 days at 10 degrees C, in broth medium with high LS:pathogen ratios, growth of E. coli O157:H7 and MDR Salmonella was inhibited by an average of 2.6 and 3.2 log CFU/ml, respectively, whereas in broth medium with low LS:pathogen ratios, E. coli O157:H7 and MDR Salmonella growth was inhibited by an average of 2.8 and 1.8 log CFU/ml, respectively. However, in raw ground beef no significant inhibition was seen with LS:pathogen ratios of 10(5):10(2) to 10(5):10(3). Significant inhibition was seen at very high LS:pathogen ratios (10(6) to 10(7):10(2) to 10(3)), but gross spoilage of the product occurred by day 6. Although presumptive LS 10-EGR-a can inhibit growth of E. coli O157:H7 and MDR Salmonella in a beef-derived broth medium, the inability to produce similar results in ground beef without deleteriously affecting the quality of the product is a limitation that needs further investigation.
TI  - Quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production is down-regulated by N-terminally truncated species of gene activators.
AB  - Down-regulation of quorum-sensing based pathways is an important but yet poorly understood process in bacterial gene regulation. In this study, we show that the gene regulator plnC not only acts as an activator gene in the quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus plantarum C11, but it also concurrently codes for truncated forms that were shown to repress bacteriocin production. By amino acid N-terminal sequencing and DNA sequence analysis, the truncated species of PlnC are believed to be translated from alternative start codons located in the so-called receiver domain of the regulator. To analyse the structure-function relationship of truncated species of PlnC, we performed a series of systematic truncation mutations: ten in the receiver domain, one in the hinge region and two in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. It was revealed that any truncation mutation containing a disrupted receiver domain together with an intact DNA-binding domain displayed a repressive effect on bacteriocin production. Such a gene repression mechanism mediated by truncated regulators was also found in two other quorum-sensing based bacteriocin systems (spp in L. sakei LTH673 and NC8-pln in L. plantarum NC8), suggesting that this mode of repression might represent a common means applied by bacteria to down-regulate certain quorum-sensing based pathways.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of arginine deiminase from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis ATCC 7962 in Escherichia coli BL21.
AB  - The arcA gene that encodes arginine deiminase (ADI, EC 3.5.3.6)--a key enzyme of  the ADI pathway--was cloned from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis ATCC 7962. The deduced amino acid sequence of the arcA gene showed high homology with the arcA gene from Lactobacillus plantarum (99%) and from Lactobacillus sakei (60%), respectively. The arcA gene from Lc. lactis spp. lactis ATCC 7962 was expressed in soluble fraction of recombinant Escherichia coli BL21. ADI produced from Lc. lactis spp. lactis ATCC 7962 (LADI) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was purified using sequential Q-Sepharose anion exchange and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column chromatography. The final yield of LADI in the purification procedure was 63.5%, and the specific activity was 140.27 U/mg. The presence of purified LADI was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and determination of the molecular mass. The LADI had a molecular mass of about 140 kDa, and comprised a homotrimer of 46 kDa in the native condition. LADI exhibited only 35% amino acid sequence homology with ADI from Mycoplasma arginini. However, LADI shared a similar three dimensional structure. The K(M) and V(max) values for arginine were 8.67+/-0.045 mM (mean+/-SD) and 344.83+/-1.79 micromol/min/mg, respectively, and the optimum temperature and pH for the production of LADI were 60 degrees C and 7.2.
TI  - Effect of industrial and natural biocides on spoilage, pathogenic and technological strains grown in biofilm.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating bactericide solutions effective on spoilage and pathogenic bacteria while preserving technological bacteria. Two compounds of essential oil (thymol and eugenol), one essential oil of Satureja thymbra and two industrial biocides (PE 270-30, Brillo) were tested on technological strains (Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus succinus and Lactobacillus sakei) grown in monoculture biofilm and on a mixed biofilm of pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes) and spoilage bacteria (Pseudomonas fragi, Escherichia coli). Biofilm cultures were performed in glass fibre filters for 24h at 20 degrees C before application of biocides. Thymol and eugenol had no effect on the mixed biofilm. S. thymbra (2%) was highly effective on spoilage strains (5 log reduction), and S. equorum (4 log reduction) was moderately effective on pathogens (2.3 log reduction) and not effective on S. succinus and L. sakei (0.5 log reduction). PE-270-30 with 10% Na((2))SO((4)) decreased spoilage bacteria (5.1 log reduction), maintained the technological bacteria, but did not reduce the pathogens. The disinfectant Brillo (3%) killed all the strains. These results showed the difficulty in obtaining a biocide that is effective in destroying spoilage and pathogenic bacteria while preserving technological bacteria. Essential oils could be a good alternative for eradicating spoilage bacteria in the food environment where they are often found at high levels.
TI  - Inhibition of membrane bound ATPases of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes by plant oil aromatics.
AB  - Previous studies have reported that the mechanism of bactericidal action of the plant oil aromatics, eugenol, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde involves inhibition of adenosine triphosphate generation and membrane disruption. In this study the capacity of the aromatics to inhibit the membrane bound ATPase activity of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes was investigated by experiments on isolated membranes. Inhibition of the ATPase activity of E. coli membranes was observed with 5 mM or 10 mM eugenol or carvacrol. Progressively greater inhibition by cinnamaldehyde was observed as concentration increased from 0.1 to 10 mM. L. monocytogenes ATPase activity was significantly inhibited by eugenol (5 or 10 mM), carvacrol (10 mM) and cinnamaldehyde (10 mM). Lactobacillus sakei is highly resistant to cinnamaldehyde compared to E. coli and L. monocytogenes. To determine whether this resistance was related to the relative hydrophobicity of the cell surface and hence the ability of the cell to take up the aromatics, the percentage of the three organisms partitioning in dodecane was compared. No significant difference was found between the partitioning percentage of L. monocytogenes (17.2%) and L. sakei (13.8%), indicating that surface hydrophobicity does not explain the differing sensitivity to cinnamaldehyde of these two organism. The percent partitioning of E. coli was significantly greater than both other organisms (23.3%) and may explain the greater sensitivity of E. coli to all three aromatics.
TI  - Improved expression and purification of the correctly folded response regulator PlnC from lactobacilli.
AB  - The response regulator PlnC is part of the signal transduction system that plays  a key role in the regulation of bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus plantarum C11. In this study, we wanted to express high levels of the response regulator PlnC in a soluble and native form for purification and further studies. The protein was expressed as a fusion protein (fPlnC) containing an N-terminal Flag-tag to facilitate detection and purification. When the fusion gene, fplnC, was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, nearly all (99%) of the recombinant protein ended up inside inclusion bodies as an incorrectly folded protein. By utilizing two different Gram-positive expression systems (SIP and NICE) in L. plantarum NC8 and Lactobacillus sakei Lb790, the expression of the soluble fPlnC was significantly increased, being 20-40 times more than that in E. coli BL21. Using the N-terminal tag, the expressed protein was purified by immunoprecipitation. By DNA-binding study (EMSA), we demonstrated that the fusion protein purified from the soluble pool was correctly folded as judged by its ability to bind specifically on regulated promoters. Using our approach, we estimate that about 1 mg of fPlnC can be purified from 11 of the bacterial culture.
TI  - Disruption of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus sakei cellular membranes by plant oil aromatics.
AB  - The role of membrane disruption in the bactericidal activity of the plant oil aromatic compounds eugenol, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy, changes in ATP levels and cell viability. In 25 mM HEPES buffer pH 7 at 20 degrees C, 10 mM eugenol or carvacrol increased uptake of propidium iodide by Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus sakei over a 10-min period. The same treatments resulted in lowered viability, rapid depletion of cellular ATP and release of ATP, with the exception of Lb. sakei treated with carvacrol. Eugenol or carvacrol at 5 mM to 10 mM inhibited E. coli and L. monocytogenes motility. Lb. sakei was resistant to cinnamaldehyde. Thus, its effects were only studied on E. coli and L. monocytogenes. At 10 mM, cinnamaldehyde caused a slight but statistically significant increase in propidium iodide staining of E. coli, but had no effect on L. monocytogenes. Cinnamaldehyde treatment of E. coli at 10 mM and L. monocytogenes at 40 mM resulted in decreased cellular ATP, but there was no concomitant release of ATP. Cinnamaldehyde at 5 and 10 mM inhibited E. coli and L. monocytogenes motility. Results for eugenol and carvacrol are consistent with non-specific permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane. Evidence for increased membrane permeability by cinnamaldehyde is less conclusive. The release of ATP from eugenol and carvacrol-treated cells and absence of release from cinnamaldehyde-treated cells could indicate that eugenol and carvacrol possess ATPase inhibiting activity. Secondary effects would also be consistent with membrane disruption.
TI  - Molecular characterization and regulatory analysis of dnaK operon of halophilic lactic acid bacterium Tetragenococcus halophila.
AB  - We have cloned and characterized the dnaK operon of Tetragenococcus halophila JCM5888. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments showed that the dnaK operon consists of four open reading frames with the organization hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. Two regulatory CIRCE (Controlling Inverted Repeat of Chaperone Expression) elements were identified in the region up-stream of hrcA. The T. halophila dnaK encoded a protein of 618 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of T. halophila DnaK showed high similarities with those of the corresponding DnaK homologues of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus sakei and Bacillus subtilis. Using a pET expression system, the T. halophila DnaK was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the purified DnaK was found to exhibit ATPase and refolding activities. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that the transcription of the dnaK gene was induced by heat shock, and several transcripts were detected including a tetra-cistronic mRNA with a maximum size of 4.9-kb which corresponds to the transcript of the complete dnaK operon. The amount of dnaK transcripts increased about 3.5-fold at high NaCl concentration of 3-4 M, but not at the same KCl concentrations. These results suggest that the cloned DnaK acts as a functional molecular chaperone and plays an important role in salinity adaptation.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of peptides from the water-soluble extracts of Italian cheese varieties.
AB  - Water-soluble extracts of 9 Italian cheese varieties that differed mainly for type of cheese milk, starter, technology, and time of ripening were fractionated by reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography, and the antimicrobial activity of each fraction was first assayed toward Lactobacillus sakei A15 by well-diffusion assay. Active fractions were further analyzed by HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry, and peptide sequences were identified by comparison with a proteomic database. Parmigiano Reggiano, Fossa, and Gorgonzola water-soluble extracts did not show antibacterial peptides. Fractions of Pecorino Romano, Canestrato Pugliese, Crescenza, and Caprino del Piemonte contained a mixture of peptides with a high degree of homology. Pasta filata cheeses (Caciocavallo and Mozzarella) also had antibacterial peptides. Peptides showed high levels of homology with N-terminal, C-terminal, or whole fragments of well known antimicrobial or multifunctional peptides reported in the literature: alphaS1-casokinin (e.g., sheep alphaS1-casein (CN) f22-30 of Pecorino Romano and cow alphaS1-CN f24-33 of Canestrato Pugliese); isracidin (e.g., sheep alphaS1-CN f10-21 of Pecorino Romano); kappacin and casoplatelin (e.g., cow kappa-CN f106-115 of Canestrato Pugliese and Crescenza); and beta-casomorphin-11 (e.g., goat beta-CN f60-68 of Caprino del Piemonte). As shown by the broth microdilution technique, most of the water-soluble fractions had a large spectrum of inhibition (minimal inhibitory concentration of 20 to 200 microg/mL) toward gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, including potentially pathogenic bacteria of clinical interest. Cheeses manufactured from different types of cheese milk (cow, sheep, and goat) have the potential to generate similar peptides with antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Identification of the DNA-binding site of the Rgg-like regulator LasX within the  lactocin S promoter region.
AB  - LasX regulates the transcription of the divergent operons lasXY and lasA-W, which specify the production of lactocin S in Lactobacillus sakei L45. Using histidine-tagged LasX, and a DNA fragment containing the complete intergenic lasA-lasX region, electrophoresis mobility-shift (EMSA) analyses were employed to demonstrate that LasX binds to the lasA-lasX intergenic DNA. Two direct heptanucleotide motifs directly upstream of P(lasA-W), and a third imperfect copy of this motif, overlapping the -10 element of P(lasA-W), were identified as possible LasX-binding sites. To assess the role of the direct repeats in the binding of LasX to the intergenic lasA-lasX region, binding experiments were performed using DNA probes with different combinations of the repeats, and with arbitrarily chosen repeat substitutions. The result of these experiments demonstrated that only the middle repeat was required for the binding of LasX to the las-promoter region. This observation correlated with the results of subsequent reporter-gene analyses, thereby weakening the hypothesis of the involvement of the direct repeats in LasX-mediated transcription regulation. By analysing the ability of LasX to bind successively shortened derivatives of the original intergenic fragment, a tentative 19 bp minimum LasX-binding site was identified.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Glucan synthesis in the genus Lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  - Members of the genera Streptococcus and Leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). In Lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (GTF) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfA of Lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first GTF enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran) that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. Recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus Lactobacillus. This paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various Lactobacillus species and the characterization of the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. The four GTF enzymes characterized from three different Lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. Interestingly, these four Lb. reuteri GTFs have relatively large N-terminal variable regions, containing RDV repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved and less-conserved YG-repeating units. The three other GTF enzymes, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the Lb. reuteri GTF enzymes.
TI  - Expression of the catalase gene katA in starter culture Lactobacillus plantarum TISTR850 tolerates oxidative stress and reduces lipid oxidation in fermented meat product.
AB  - The catalase gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei SR911 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli UM2 and Lactobacillus plantarum TISTR850 under strong lactococcal promoter P59 in E. coli-lactococcus expression vector pIL1020. The L. plantarum TISTR850 is a catalase-deficient strain isolated from local fermented meat product. The recombinant L. plantarum TISTR850 was shown to decompose hydrogen peroxide, and catalase activity approximately three times higher that of natural catalase-producing strain L. sakei SR911. The recombinant protein was also detected by in situ activity staining of the catalase enzyme. The recombinant L. plantarum TISTR850 did not accumulate hydrogen peroxide under glucose-limited aerobic conditions and remained viable after 60 h of incubation. The recombinant and host strain L. plantarum TISTR850 were used as starter cultures in the fermented meat product, and lipid oxidation was monitored over a 7-day storage at 20 degrees C determined as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) value. The lipid oxidation level in the fermented meat product seeded with the catalase genetically modified starter culture L. plantarum TISTR850 was significantly lower than that of the natural catalase-deficient strain.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Structural analysis of the peptide pheromone receptor PlnB, a histidine protein kinase from Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Intercellular communication plays a key role in the regulation of several physiological processes in gram-positive bacteria. Cell-cell communication is often mediated by secreted inducer peptide pheromones (IPs), which upon reaching a threshold concentration in the environment specifically activate a cognate membrane-localized histidine protein kinase (HPK). Interestingly, the majority of IP-activated HPKs fall into one distinct subfamily (HPK(10)). As part of an effort to study the mechanism underlying pheromone-mediated activation of the HPK(10) subfamily, the present work investigated the membrane topology of PlnB from Lactobacillus plantarum. Gene fusion experiments with Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus sakei, using alkaline phosphatase, beta-lactamase, and beta-galactosidase reporter fusions, suggested that PlnB is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via seven transmembrane segments. By domain switching between HPK(10) members, it was demonstrated that the determinants for pheromone binding and specificity are contained within the transmembrane domain. The results also indicate that the mechanism of signal transduction, in which the final transmembrane segment apparently plays a key role, is conserved between members of the HPK(10) subfamily.
TI  - Characterization of a theta-type plasmid from Lactobacillus sakei: a potential basis for low-copy-number vectors in lactobacilli.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the 13-kb plasmid pRV500, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei RV332, was determined. Sequence analysis enabled the identification of genes coding for a putative type I restriction-modification system, two genes coding for putative recombinases of the integrase family, and a region likely involved in replication. The structural features of this region, comprising a putative ori segment containing 11- and 22-bp repeats and a repA gene coding for a putative initiator protein, indicated that pRV500 belongs to the pUCL287 subfamily of theta-type replicons. A 3.7-kb fragment encompassing this region was fused to an Escherichia coli replicon to produce the shuttle vector pRV566 and was observed to be functional in L. sakei for plasmid replication. The L. sakei replicon alone could not support replication in E. coli. Plasmid pRV500 and its derivative pRV566 were determined to be at very low copy numbers in L. sakei. pRV566 was maintained at a reasonable rate over 20 generations in several lactobacilli, such as Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus plantarum, in addition to L. sakei, making it an interesting basis for developing vectors. Sequence relationships with other plasmids are described and discussed.
TI  - Development of an inducible gene expression system for Lactobacillus sakei.
AB  - AIM: To develop an inducible gene expression system for Lactobacillus sakei, based on the regulatory system of sakacin A production. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Lactobacillus/Escherichia coli shuttle vector; pKRV3, was constructed including the signal transducing system genes of the bacteriocin sakacin A. The gusA gene fused to PsapA promoter, cloned in this vector allowed for inducible beta-glucuronidase expression in L. sakei and L. plantarum following the addition of the sakacin A inducing peptide. PsapA appeared to be a strong and tightly controlled promoter when compared with known promoters. CONCLUSION: The pKRV3 system can be used as an inducible gene expression system in lactobacilli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A novel, inducible gene expression system has been developed for lactic acid bacteria relevant in food fermentations.
TI  - Bile stress response in Listeria monocytogenes LO28: adaptation, cross-protection, and identification of genetic loci involved in bile resistance.
AB  - Bile is one of many barriers that Listeria monocytogenes must overcome in the human gastrointestinal tract in order to infect and cause disease. We demonstrated that stationary-phase cultures of L. monocytogenes LO28 were able to tolerate concentrations of bovine, porcine, and human bile and bile acids well in excess of those encountered in vivo. Strain LO28 was relatively bile resistant compared with other clinical isolates of L. monocytogenes, as well as with Listeria innocua, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, and Lactobacillus sakei. While exponential-phase L. monocytogenes LO28 cells were exquisitely sensitive to unconjugated bile acids, prior adaptation to sublethal levels of bile acids or heterologous stresses, such as acid, heat, salt, or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), significantly enhanced bile resistance. This adaptive response was independent of protein synthesis, and in the cases of bile and SDS adaptation, occurred in seconds. In order to identify genetic loci involved in the bile tolerance phenotype of L. monocytogenes LO28, transposon (Tn917) and plasmid (pORI19) integration banks were screened for bile-sensitive mutants. The disrupted genes included a homologue of the capA locus required for capsule formation in Bacillus anthracis; a gene encoding the transcriptional regulator ZurR; a homologue of an Escherichia coli gene, lytB, involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis; a gene encoding a homologue of the Bacillus subtilis membrane protein YxiO; and a gene encoding an amino acid transporter with a putative role in pH homeostasis, gadE. Interestingly, all of the identified loci play putative roles in maintenance of the cell envelope or in stress responses.
TI  - LasX, a transcriptional regulator of the lactocin S biosynthetic genes in Lactobacillus sakei L45, acts both as an activator and a repressor.
AB  - The 11 kb las locus, present on the 50 kb plasmid pCIM1, specifies the production of the lantibiotic lactocin S in Lactobacillus sakei L45. The gene cluster is organized into two oppositely orientated operons, lasAMNTUVPJW (lasA-W) and lasXY, the former of which contains the biosynthetic, immunity and transport genes. We have previously shown that inactivation of lasX abolishes lactocin S production and causes a drastic reduction in lasA-specific transcripts (encoding pre-lactocin S). The aim of this study was to determine whether or not the product of lasX, which is significantly similar to Rgg-like regulators, was directly involved in transcriptional regulation of the lactocin S biosynthetic genes. The divergently orientated and overlapping promoters, P(lasA)(-W) and P(lasXY), were transcriptionally fused to the Escherichia coli gusA gene, and the activity of the fusions was assayed in the presence and absence of lasX, which was expressed on a separate plasmid. A significant stimulation of expression (5-6-fold) of the P(lasA-W)-gusA fusion was observed in the presence of lasX, whereas expression of the P(lasXY)-gusA construct was reduced 1.5-2-fold. Our results strongly suggest that LasX is a bifunctional regulatory protein, acting both as an activator of lasA-W transcription and as a repressor of lasXY transcription. While a transcription stimulation activity has been described for several of the Rgg-like proteins, the present study is the first to report an autorepressor function for a member of this protein group.
TI  - IL-10 producing CD14low monocytes inhibit lymphocyte-dependent activation of intestinal epithelial cells by commensal bacteria.
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) activation by non-pathogenic, commensal bacteria was demonstrated to require the presence of immunocompetent cells. In this study, HT-29 and CaCO-2 transwell cultures, reconstituted with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and CD14high monocytes, were challenged with non-pathogenic Gram negative Escherichia coli and Gram positive lactobacilli. Cytokine expression was analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA in E. coli or L. sakei challenged IEC was promoted by lymphocyte populations predominantly CD4+ T cells, while monocytes failed to mediate an inflammatory cytokine response. The monocyte phenotype and function were further characterised by flow cytometry and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). During the co-culture with IEC and bacterial stimulated IEC, CD14high peripheral blood monocytes acquired a CD14low CD16low phenotype with reduced expression co-stimulatory (CD80, CD86, CD58) cell surface molecules. Immunosuppressive functions of IEC conditioned CD14low monocytes were demonstrated by the predominant secretion of IL-10 and IL-IRa and their reduced potential to trigger an allogeneic lymphocyte response. In conclusion, IEC contribute to the development of CD14low CD16low monocytes with immunosuppressive function and antagonised a lymphocyte-mediated activation of the intestinal epithelium in response to intestinal and food derived bacteria. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the gut epithelium constitutes an important functional element in the regulation of mucosal immune homeostasis towards commensal bacteria.
TI  - Molecular typing techniques to characterize the development of a lactic acid bacteria community on vacuum-packaged beef.
AB  - The development of a community of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum-packaged beef  was investigated during a 6-week storage trial at 2 degrees C. The lactic acid bacteria population was monitored by using molecular techniques to identify a random sample of isolates at biweekly intervals during the storage trial. The polymerase chain reaction and a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA technique were used to identify and distinguish populations of lactic acid bacteria that developed during the storage trial. At week 0, the population of lactic acid bacteria was 3.5 log cfu/120 cm2 and by week 6, the population reached a maximum of 7.6 log cfu/120 cm2. A sampling from the week 0 population indicated a mixed community of Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei and Leuconostoc spp. However, the sampling from week 6 indicated the population composition had changed to one where a single Leuconostoc strain predominated. This strain demonstrated antagonism towards the growth of other lactic acid bacteria isolated during the study. Additionally, the strain inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. DNA sequence data from the 16S rRNA gene suggested that the isolate may be a Leuconostoc gelidum strain.
TI  - Industrial application of an antilisterial strain of Lactobacillus sakei as a protective culture and its effect on the sensory acceptability of cooked, sliced, vacuum-packaged meats.
AB  - The application of a protective lactic acid bacterium (LAB) during the commercial production of cooked meat products is described. The LAB, a strain of Lactobacillus sakei, was previously isolated from cooked ham and inhibited growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in this product. L. sakei was applied to the cooked products at a concentration of 10(5)-10(6) cfu/g immediately before slicing and vacuum-packaging using a hand-operated spraying bottle. The LAB strain inhibited growth of 10(3) cfu/g of a cocktail of three rifampicin resistant mutant L. monocytogenes strains both at 8 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Consumer acceptance tests of cooked ham and of servelat sausage, a Norwegian non-fermented cooked meat sausage, showed that control and inoculated products were equally acceptable. The products were still acceptable after storage for 28 days at 4 degrees C and, after opening the packages, for a further 5 days at 4 degrees C. The findings presented here confirm that the L. sakei strain is suitable for use as a protective culture and may technically easily be implemented in the commercial production of cooked meat products.
TI  - Surface application of lysozyme, nisin, and EDTA to inhibit spoilage and pathogenic bacteria on ham and bologna.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if the effectiveness of an antimicrobial treatment for cooked ham and bologna would be increased or maintained when applied in a surface coating. Cooked 10-g disks of ham and bologna sausage received one of three treatments: no coating (control), coating with 0.2 g of 7% (wt/vol) gelatin gel (gel-control), or coating with 0.2 g of 7% gelatin gel containing 25.5 g/liter of lysozyme-nisin (1:3) plus 25.5 g/liter of EDTA (gel-treated). The samples were then inoculated with one of six test organisms: Brochothrix thermosphacta, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, or Salmonella Typhimurium. Inoculated samples were vacuum packed and stored at 8 degrees C for 4 weeks. The antimicrobial gel treatment had an immediate bactericidal effect up to 4 log CFU/cm2 on the four gram-positive organisms tested (B. thermosphacta, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Listeria monocytogenes) and inhibited the growth of these organisms during the 4 weeks of storage. The antimicrobial gel treatment also had a bactericidal effect on the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium during storage. The numbers of E. coli O157:H7 on ham were reduced by 2 log CFU/cm2 following treatment with both antimicrobial-containing and non-antimicrobial-containing gels during the 4-week storage period. No effect was observed on the growth of E. coli O157:H7 on bologna.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - Development of genetic tools for Lactobacillus sakei: disruption of the beta-galactosidase gene and use of lacZ as a reporter gene To study regulation of the putative copper ATPase, AtkB.
AB  - Downstream from the ptsHI operon of Lactobacillus sakei, the genes atkY and atkB, organized in an operon, were observed. The two putative proteins, AtkB and AtkY, show sequence similarity to the Enterococcus hirae copper P-type ATPase, responsible for copper efflux, and its negative regulator. Characterization of AtkB as a copper P-type ATPase could not be demonstrated since an atkB mutant did not show any phenotype. Thus, another strategy was followed in order to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the atkYB locus, leading to the development of new genetic tools for L. sakei. A plasmid was constructed, the use of which allowed gene replacement at the lacLM locus in L. sakei by two successive crossovers. A strain deleted of the lacLM operon encoding the beta-galactosidase of L. sakei was constructed by this method, and the Escherichia coli lacZ gene could then be used as a reporter gene to investigate the regulation of atkYB. Results show that the atkYB operon is induced by small concentrations of CuSO(4) (30 to 40 microM) but not when CuSO(4) is omitted or added at higher concentrations.
TI  - Ribose utilization in Lactobacillus sakei: analysis of the regulation of the rbs  operon and putative involvement of a new transporter.
AB  - A 7-kb DNA fragment of Lactobacillus sakei, containing the rbsD, rbsK and rbsR genes was sequenced. The genes responsible for ribose utilization are organized differently from what was previously described for model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. No gene encoding RbsA, RbsB and RbsC, the subunits of the ribose ABC-transporter, were present in the rbs gene cluster. Instead, we found an open reading frame coding for RbsU, a protein similar to GltA, the glucose transporter of Staphylococcus xylosus. The disruption of rbsK, encoding the ribokinase, impaired growth on ribose. The disruption of rbsR, encoding the repressor, had no effect on the ability to grow on ribose, but led to overexpression of a large transcript corresponding to rbsU, rbsD and rbsK, suggesting that RbsU might be involved in ribose utilization. Ribose uptake and phosphorylation assays on the wild type strain and various mutants showed that, in ptsI mutants, both ribose uptake and phosphorylation are increased. These increased activities can explain the faster growth rate on ribose that was observed in ptsI mutants. The phosphotransferase system is thus involved in the negative regulation of ribose utilization. This regulation might not act at the transcriptional level since the overexpression of the rbs genes in the rbsR mutant did not lead to the same phenotype. A gene sharing high similarity scores with ackA genes, encoding the acetate kinase, was found upstream from the rbs gene cluster. The unusual location of this gene is maybe not fortuitous since acetate kinase is involved in ribose catabolism.
TI  - Non-pathogenic bacteria elicit a differential cytokine response by intestinal epithelial cell/leucocyte co-cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are thought to participate  in the mucosal defence against bacteria and in the regulation of mucosal tissue homeostasis. Reactivity of IEC to bacterial signals may depend on interactions with immunocompetent cells. To address the question of whether non-pathogenic bacteria modify the immune response of the intestinal epithelium, we co-cultivated enterocyte-like CaCO-2 cells with human blood leucocytes in separate compartments of transwell cultures. METHODS: CaCO-2/PBMC co-cultures were stimulated with non-pathogenic bacteria and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, monocyte chemoattracting protein 1 (MCP-1), and IL-10 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (cytokine secretion) and by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Challenge of CaCO-2 cells with non-pathogenic E coli and Lactobacillus sakei induced expression of IL-8, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha mRNA in the presence of underlying leucocytes. Leucocyte sensitised CaCO-2 cells produced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta whereas IL-10 was exclusively secreted by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CaCO-2 cells alone remained hyporesponsive to the bacterial challenge. Lactobacillus johnsonii, an intestinal isolate, showed reduced potential to induce proinflammatory cytokines but increased transforming growth factor beta mRNA in leucocyte sensitised CaCO-2 cells. TNF-alpha was identified as one of the early mediators involved in cellular cross talk. In the presence of leucocytes, discriminative activation of CaCO-2 cells was observed between enteropathogenic E coli and non-pathogenic bacteria. CONCLUSION: The differential recognition of non-pathogenic bacteria by CaCO-2 cells required the presence of underlying leucocytes. These results strengthen the hypothesis that bacterial signalling at the mucosal surface is dependent on a network of cellular interactions.
TI  - High levels of background flora inhibits growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef.
AB  - The influence of natural background flora under aerobic and anaerobic incubation  on the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef was investigated. The background flora from eight different commercial ground beef were added to ground beef spiked with E. coli O157:H7 and stored either aerobically or anaerobically at 12 degrees C. The results showed that the presence of a large number of background bacteria in the ground meat inhibited the growth of E. coli O157:H7 both aerobically and anaerobically. Inhibition was more pronounced under anaerobic conditions. The background floras consisted mainly of lactic acid bacteria of which approximately 80% were Lactobacillus sakei. These results show the importance of the natural background flora in meat for inhibition of growth of E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by nonpathogenic bacteria  in vitro: evidence of NK cells as primary targets.
AB  - The interaction of commensal bacteria with immunocompetent cells may occur in definite compartments of the mucosal immune system, as limited translocation through the epithelial barrier cannot be excluded. In this study the stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified lymphocyte subsets by nonpathogenic gram-positive lactobacilli (Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus sakei) and gram-negative Escherichia coli was investigated. The various bacterial strains induced a differential cytokine pattern. Whereas L. johnsonii and L. sakei strongly induced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), E. coli and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preferentially induced IL-10 after 16 h of stimulation. Expression of activation antigens CD69 and CD25 was observed on (CD3(-) CD56(+)) natural killer (NK) cells after stimulation of total human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All bacteria mediated the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the strongest proliferative response was observed with L. johnsonii. Purified CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD19(+) lymphocyte subsets were not activated upon bacterial stimulation but showed normal response to a mitogenic stimulus. In contrast, purified NK cells upregulated the IL-2Ralpha chain (CD25) and underwent proliferation when stimulated by L. johnsonii. E. coli and LPS were less effective in inducing proliferation. Expression of CD25 or secretion of IFN-gamma from purified NK cells was significantly increased in the presence of bacterially primed macrophages, indicating that full activation required both bacterium- and cell contact-based signals derived from accessory cells.
TI  - Protective cultures inhibit growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cooked, sliced, vacuum- and gas-packaged meat.
AB  - Contamination of cooked meat products with Listeria monocytogenes poses a constant threat to the meat industry. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the use of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as protective cultures in cooked meat products. Cooked, sliced, vacuum- or gas-packaged ham and servelat sausage from nine meat factories in Norway were inoculated with 10(3) cfu/g of a mixture of three rifampicin resistant (rif-mutant) strains of L. monocytogenes and stored at 8 degrees C for four weeks. Growth of L. monocytogenes and indigenous lactic acid flora was followed throughout the storage period. LAB were isolated from samples where L. monocytogenes failed to grow. Five different strains growing well at 3 degrees C. pH 6.2, with 3% NaCl, and producing moderate amounts of acid were selected for challenge experiments with the rif-resistant strains of L. monocytogenes. a nalidixic acid/streptomycin sulphate-resistant strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and a mixture of three rif-resistant strains of Yersinia enterocolitica O:3. All five LAB strains inhibited growth of both L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7. No inhibition of Y. enterocolitica O:3 was observed. A professional taste panel evaluated cooked, sliced, vacuum-packaged ham inoculated with each of the five test strains after storage for 21 days at 8 degrees C. All samples had acceptable sensory properties. The five LAB strains hybridised to a 23S rRNA oligonucleotide probe specific for Lactobacillus sakei. These indigenous LAB may be used as protective cultures to inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 in cooked meat products.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of the dnaK operon of Lactobacillus sakei LTH681.
AB  - The use of lactobacilli as starter organisms in food fermentation processes requires thorough knowledge of their reaction to the multitude of ecological factors including their response to stress. We have characterised the dnaK gene region of Lactobacillus sakei LTH681. Two chromosomal EcoRI fragments of 2.5 and 4.0 kb were identified using a homologous dnaK probe generated by PCR. The sequence analysis of the cloned fragments showed that the dnaK gene region consists of four heat shock genes with the organisation hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed high similarity to the corresponding heat shock proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. An upstream located orfY was found which exhibited substantial similarity (41.5%) to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase of Enterobacter aerogenes. Northern hybridisation analysis revealed that the transcription of the genes is induced by heat shock (42 degrees C) as well as salt (6%) or ethanol (10%) stress. Several transcripts were detected including a polycistronic mRNA of 4.9 kb which represents the transcript of the complete dnaK gene region indicating a tetracistronic organisation of the dnaK operon. The other RNA fragments were identified as shorter transcripts (3.7 and 1.3 kb) or cleavage products of the polycistronic mRNAs. The transcription start sites of the dnaK operon were determined under inducing and non-inducing conditions. The site varied with the applied stress condition. A regulatory CIRCE element was identified located between the transcription and translation start site. The promoter region including CIRCE was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene gusA and expressed in L. sakei LTH681. The kinetics of transcriptional induction of gusA by heat shocking were identical to those of the dnaK operon confirming the involvement of the CIRCE element in regulation of gene expression.
TI  - Disruption of the sole ldhL gene in Lactobacillus sakei prevents the production of both L- and D-lactate.
AB  - A 7 kb DNA fragment was cloned from Lactobacillus sakei which contains the IdhL gene encoding the L(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH). Analysis of the DNA sequence, Northern experiments and primer extension experiments showed that IdhL is transcribed from a single promoter, leading to a monocistronic 1.15 kb mRNA which yields the L-LDH. A stable mutant was constructed by chromosomal integration of a chloramphenicol cassette into IdhL by a double-crossover event. Both L- and D-lactate were produced by the wild-type strain whereas only residual amounts of both isomers were produced by the mutant. This demonstrates that L. sakei possesses an L-LDH producing L-lactate and a lactate racemase able to transform it to D-lactate, but is devoid of D-LDH activity. Moreover the ability to degrade L-lactate present in the medium that was observed with the mutant strain grown aerobically suggests that an L-lactate oxidase activity is also present in L. sakei.
TI  - Oxygen-dependent regulation of the expression of the catalase gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei LTH677.
AB  - The catalase gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei LTH677 was cloned and expressed in  Escherichia coli UM2, Lactobacillus casei LK1, and Lactobacillus curvatus LTH1432. The last host is a catalase-deficient plasmid-cured derivative of a starter organism used in meat fermentation. The regulation of katA expression was found to be the same in L. sakei LTH677 and the recombinant strains. The addition of H2O2 to anaerobic cultures, as well as a switch to aerobic conditions, resulted in a strong increase in KatA activity. The expression was investigated in more detail with L. sakei LTH677 and L. curvatus LTH4002. The recombinant strain LTH4002 did not accumulate H2O2 under glucose-limited aerobic conditions and remained viable in the stationary phase. Under inductive conditions, the katA-specific mRNA and the apoenzyme were synthesized de novo. Deletion derivatives of the katA promoter were produced, and the regulatory response was investigated by fusion to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene gusA and expression in L. sakei LTH677. The fact that gene expression was subject to induction was confirmed at the level of transcription and protein synthesis. A small putative regulatory sequence of at least 25 bp was identified located upstream of the -35 site. Competition experiments performed with L. sakei LTH677 harboring the fusion constructs consisting of the katA promoter and gusA revealed that an activator protein is involved in the transcriptional induction of katA.
