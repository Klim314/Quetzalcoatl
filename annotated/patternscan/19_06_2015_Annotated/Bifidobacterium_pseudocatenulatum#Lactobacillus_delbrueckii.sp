TI  == viability and activity of bifidobacteria during refrigerated storage of yoghurt containing mangifera pajang fibrous polysaccharides.
AB  == the viability and activity of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum g4, b. longum bb  536 and yoghurt cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied in yoghurt containing 0.75% mangefira pajang fibrous polysaccharides (mpfp) and inulin. growth of probiotic organisms,  their proteolytic activities, the production of short chain fatty acids (lactic,  acetic and propionic) and the ph of the yoghurt samples were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees c for 28 d. b. pseudocatenulatum g4 and b. longum bb 536 showed better growth and activity in the presence of mpfp and inulin, which significantly increased the production of short chain fatty acids as well as the proteolytic activity of these organisms. practical application: this is the first study reported on produce synbiotic yoghurt as a functional food for specified health uses contains bifidobacteria and m. pajang fibrous polysaccharides. m. pajang fibrous polysaccharides can be used as a prebiotic particularly in dairy products to increase the viability and activity of bifidobacteria which can be used as probiotic to exert health benefit to the human by yoghurt that is considered common use in society; thus, the benefits of  synbiotic yoghurt are readily accessible to the member of society.
