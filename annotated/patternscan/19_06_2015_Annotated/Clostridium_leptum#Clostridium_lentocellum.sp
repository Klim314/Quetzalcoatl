TI  == molecular biological detection and characterization of clostridium populations in municipal landfill sites.
AB  == primer sets specific for 16s rrna genes were designed for four phylogenetic groups of clostridia known to contain mesophilic cellulolytic species. specific amplification of these groups from landfill leachate dna extracts demonstrated the widespread occurrence of clostridia from the clostridium thermocellum and c.  leptum groups. in contrast, the c. botulinum group was never detected, and the c. coccoides-c. lentocellum group was only occasionally detected. amplification products were analyzed by temporal thermal gel electrophoresis to generate profiles of the clostridial groups and to identify dominant bands. sequence analysis of 17 landfill clones confirmed that the primers were specific for the clostridial subgroups and that the cloned sequences had a close relationship with known cellulose-degrading clostridia. the primers have therefore been authenticated for use in the rapid identification of clostridia in anaerobic environments.
