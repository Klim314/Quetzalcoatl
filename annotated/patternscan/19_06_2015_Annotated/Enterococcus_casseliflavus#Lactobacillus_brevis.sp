TI  == phenotypic and genotypic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional pickles of the cubuk region in turkey.
AB  == a total of 152 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from pickles produced in  the ankara-cubuk region. these isolates were clustered into eight groups on the basis of their phenotypic characteristics including cell morphology, co2 production from glucose, growth at 10 and 45 degrees c, growth in 6.5 % nacl, and growth at ph 9.6. api 50 ch carbohydrate fermentation test, 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequence analysis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) whole-cell protein profile analysis were also performed for precise identification of the isolates at the species level. molecular identification revealed that the most prevalent lab species involved in pickle fermentation were pediococcus ethanolidurans (46 isolates, 30.3 %), lactobacillus brevis (37 isolates, 24.3 %), lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates, 24.3 %), and lactobacillus buchneri (15 isolates, 9.9 %). other lab were found in minor frequencies such as pediococcus parvulus (8 isolates, 5.3 %), lactobacillus namurensis (6 isolates, 3.9 %), lactobacillus diolivorans (1 isolate, 0.7 %), lactobacillus parabrevis (1 isolate, 0.7 %), and enterococcus casseliflavus (1 isolate, 0.7 %). when results of phenotypic and genotypic identification methods  were compared, differences in the species distribution of lab associated with pickles were defined between the api and the 16s rrna sequencing. the api 50 chl  test coincided with the 16s rrna results in 71 out of the 152 tested isolates, indicating that api gave unreliable identification results. a clear correlation could not be found between the results of whole-cell sds profiles and 16s rrna sequencing. therefore, molecular characterization by 16s rrna sequencing was considered to be the most reliable method for identifying isolates. the results presented in this work provide insight in to the lab population associated with traditional cubuk pickles and constitute a lab strain resource for further studies involving the development of starter cultures.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == enterococcus and lactobacillus contamination of raw milk in a farm dairy environment.
AB  == enterococci and lactobacilli are ubiquitously found in the intestinal microflora  of humans and animals. the aim of the present study was to determine the importance of bovine faeces as a source of these organisms in raw milk. one hundred and fifty six putative enterococci and 362 lactobacilli were isolated from bovine faeces (n=26), cows' teats, raw milk, the milking machine and the milking environment on one farm. the clonal relationships of each group were investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and representatives of the different clusters were identified by repetitive dna element (rep)-pcr fingerprinting, protein profiling, phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) sequence analysis or 16s rdna gene sequencing. lactobacilli were present at approximately  3 orders of magnitude greater than enterococci in the bovine faeces. the majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal isolates were identified as aerococcus viridans. seven teat isolates belonged to a potential novel aerococcus sp. and one bovine faecal isolate to a potential second novel aerococcus sp. the lactobacilli present in the bovine faeces were predominantly lactobacillus mucosae and lactobacillus brevis, with small numbers of lactobacillus plantarum.  only one enterococcus (a strain of e. casseliflavus) out of 76 and one lactobacillus (a strain of l. parabuchneri/kefir) out of 247 of the bovine faecal isolates was found in the milk. the major source of these bacteria in the milk was the milking equipment.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.
