TI  - Effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to Caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Yeast cell wall (YCW) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of LAB. This extract was metabolised by the bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium to Caco-2 cells. Yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance LAB intestinal populations and control pathogens.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Mixed culture fermentation studies on the effects of synbiotics on the human intestinal pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Batch and continuous culture anaerobic fermentation systems, inoculated with human faeces, were utilised to investigate the antimicrobial actions of two probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum 0407, combined with oligofructose and Bifidobacterium bifidum Bb12, combined with a mixture of oligofructose and xylo-oligosaccharides (50:50 w/w) against E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni. In batch fermenters, both E. coli and C. jejuni were inhibited by the synbiotics, even when the culture pH was maintained at around neutral. In continuous culture C. jejuni was inhibited but the synbiotic failed to inhibit E. coli. Although no definitive answer in addressing the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial activity was derived, results suggested that acetate and lactate directly were conferring antagonistic action, rather than as a result of lowering culture pH. In the course of the study culturing and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) methodologies for the enumeration of bacterial populations were compared. Bifidobacterial populations were underestimated using plating techniques, suggesting the non-culturability of certain bifidobacterial species.
TI  - In vitro investigations of the effect of probiotics and prebiotics on selected human intestinal pathogens.
AB  - Abstract This study investigated the effects of selected probiotic microorganisms, in combination with prebiotics, on certain human intestinal food-borne pathogens. Probiotics grown with different carbohydrate sources were observed to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enteritidis, with the extent of inhibition varying according to the carbohydrate source provided. Prebiotics identified as being preferentially utilised by the probiotics tested were oligofructose (FOS), inulin, xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS), and mixtures of inulin:FOS (80:20 w/w) and FOS:XOS (50:50 w/w). Two of the probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium bifidum were selected for further co-culture experiments. Each was combined with the selected prebiotics, and was observed to inhibit pathogen growth strongly. Results suggested that acetate and lactate were directly conferring antagonistic action, which was not necessarily related to a lowering of culture pH.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
