TI  == production of bacteriocin by leuconostoc mesenteroides 406 isolated from mongolian fermented mare's milk, airag.
AB  == the purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides strain 406 that was isolated from traditional mongolian fermented mare's milk, airag, were carried out. leuconostoc mesenteroides strain 406 was identified on the basis of its morphological and biochemical characteristics and  carbohydrate fermentation profile and by api 50 ch kit and 16s ribosomal dna analyses. the neutral-ph cell-free supernatant of this bacterium inhibited the growth of several lactic acid bacteria and food spoilage and pathogenic organisms, including listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum. the bacteriocin was heat-stable and not sensitive to acid and alkaline conditions, but was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes such as pepsin, pronase e, proteinase k, trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin, but not catalase. optimum bacteriocin production (4000 activity units/ml) was achieved when the strain was  cultured at 25 degrees c for 24-36 h in man rogosa sharpe medium. the bacteriocin was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation), dialysis (cut-off mw: 1000), and gel filtration chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the bacteriocin had a molecular weight of approximately 3.3 kda. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of a bacteriocin-producing leuconostoc strain from airag. an application to fermented milks would be desired.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of foodborne paenibacillus and bacillus spp. against clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the saprophytic paenibacillus and bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. culture supernatants of 200 strains of paenibacillus and bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against c.  botulinum type a, proteolytic type b, and type e strains in a well diffusion assay. nineteen strains were positive against c. botulinum. among those, seven paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the  largest antimicrobial spectrum against c. botulinum strains. the antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive p. polymyxa strains. the antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees c and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees c in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. in co-cultures with the positive strain of p. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a c. botulinum type e strain was inhibited whenever p. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before c. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. the antimicrobial activity of p. polymyxa against c. botulinum was attributed to the  production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to  these antimicrobial peptides.
