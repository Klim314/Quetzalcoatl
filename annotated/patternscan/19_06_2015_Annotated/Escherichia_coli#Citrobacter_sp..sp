TI  == locus of enterocyte effacement: a pathogenicity island involved in the virulence  of enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic escherichia coli subjected to a complex  network of gene regulation.
AB  == the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) is a 35.6 kb pathogenicity island inserted in the genome of some bacteria such as enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e.coli, citrobacter rodentium, and escherichia albertii.  lee comprises the genes responsible for causing attaching and effacing lesions, a characteristic lesion that involves intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, a signaling cascade leading to brush border and microvilli destruction, and loss of ions, causing severe diarrhea. it is composed of 41 open reading frames and five major operons encoding a type three system apparatus, secreted proteins, an adhesin, called intimin, and its receptor called translocated intimin receptor (tir). lee is subjected to various levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators located  both inside and outside of the pathogenicity island. several molecules were described being related to feedback inhibition, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression. these molecules are involved in a complex network of  regulation, including mechanisms such as quorum sensing and temporal control of lee genes transcription and translation. in this mini review we have detailed the complex network that regulates transcription and expression of genes involved in  this kind of lesion.

TI  == identification, cloning and heterologous expression of active [nife]-hydrogenase  2 from citrobacter sp. sg in escherichia coli.
AB  == hydrogen (h2) is a potential alternative energy carrier which only produces water and heat upon combustion. today, industrial hydrogen production mainly uses thermochemical processes based on fossil fuels or electrolysis of water. therefore, biotechnological approaches to produce h2 from biomass are an interesting alternative. we introduce here a novel direct hydrogen measurement system using a semiconducting device specific for hydrogen detection. using this  device, a bacterium producing considerable amounts of hydrogen under aerobic cultivation was isolated and identified by 16s ribosomal dna sequencing as citrobacter sp. the enzyme responsible for the observed hydrogenase activity was  partially purified by 3 chromatographic purification steps and could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting to be a type 2 [nife]-hydrogenase. expression of the [nife]-hydrogenase 2 containing operon from citrobacter sp. sg  in escherichia coli allowed recombinant hydrogen production. the [nife]-hydrogenase 2 identified here may be useful for biotechnological hydrogen  production. we speculate that the expression of the hydrogenase in citrobacter may be an adaptation to growth in acidic conditions.

TI  == screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == purpose: escherichia coli (e. coli) o157:h7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen producing different types of shiga toxin. this bacterium is the most corporate cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. administration of antibiotics (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people. around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. in the present study, we have focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the treatment of patients infected with e. coli o157:h7. this study is based on the identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude e. coli o157:h7 from the gut of the infected individual. materials and methods: hundred samples from human, animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative rods (gnrs). results: out of these samples, 175 isolates of gnrs were checked for their activity against e. coli o157:h7. only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of  e. coli o157:h7, among which majority were identified as e. coli. these e. coli strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. some of the closely  related species i. e., citrobacter sp, pantoea sp. and kluyvera sp. also showed considerable colicinogenic activity. moreover, colicinogenic species were found to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (ph 3) and sensitive to commonly used antibiotics. conclusion: nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells (cec) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in e. coli o157:h7 infections.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == selective oxidation of glycerol to 1,3-dihydroxyacetone by covalently immobilized glycerol dehydrogenases with higher stability and lower product inhibition.
AB  == glycerol dehydrogenase (glydh) catalyzes the regioselective oxidation of glycerol to yield 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (dha); an important building block in chemical industry. three recombinant glydhs from geobacillus stearothermophilus, from citrobacter braakii and from cellulomonas sp. were stabilized by covalent immobilization. the highest activity recoveries (40-50%) of the insoluble preparations were obtained by immobilizing these enzymes in presence of polyethylene glycol (peg). noteworthy, these immobilized preparations were more stable and less inhibited by dha than their soluble counterparts. in particular,  glydh from g.stearothermophilus immobilized on agarose activated with both amine  and glyoxyl groups and crosslinked with dextran aldehyde was 3.7-fold less inhibited by dha than its soluble form and retained 100% of its initial activity  after 18h of incubation at 65 degrees c and ph 7. this is one of the few examples where the same immobilization protocol has minimized enzyme product inhibition and maximized thermal stability.

TI  == molecular detection of esbls production and antibiotic resistance patterns in gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  == background: beta-lactam resistance is more prevalent in gram negative bacterial isolates worldwide, particularly in developing countries. in order to provide data relating to antibiotic therapy and resistance control, routine monitoring of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes is necessary. aims: the aim of this study was the characterization of beta-lactam resistance genes and its plasmid profile in bacteria isolated from urinary tract infection samples. materials and  methods: in this study, 298 gram negative bacteria isolated from 6739 urine specimens were identified by biochemical standard tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains were also detected by the double-disk synergy test. the presence of blatem and blashv genes in the strains studied was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. results: of all gram negative bacteria, escherichia coli (69.1%) was the most common strain, followed by klebsiella sp. (12.1%), enterobacter sp. (8.4%), proteus sp. (4.4%),  citrobacter (4%) and pseudomonas sp. (2%). the most antibiotic resistance was shown to tetracycline (95.16%), nalidixic acid (89.78%) and gentamycin (73.20%) antibiotics. among all the strains tested, 35 isolates (11.75%) expressed esbl activity. the prevalence of tem and shv positivity among these isolates was 34.29%, followed by tem (31.43%), tem and shv negativity (20.0%) and shv (14.29%), respectively. conclusions: regular monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance seems necessary to improve our guidelines in the use of the empirical  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  == background: hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. methods: cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in brooklyn, ny. as a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr method. results: of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. cephalosporin-resistant citrobacter freundii (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 2), and enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not  from control sites. one isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated vim-2. acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6  miles (p = .004). eleven a baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr and were also related to a known clinical isolate. conclusions: strains of a baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand  cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. the finding of integron-associated vim-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further  vigilance is warranted.

TI  == anti-esbl activity of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized using soil streptomyces species.
AB  == emergence of antibiotic resistance by bacteria has become a serious threat for public health worldwide. in this study, streptomyces isolated from fertile soil sample was tested for biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using cell-free supernatant and synthesized agnps were screened for anti-esbl (extended spectrum b-lactamase) activity against multi-drug resistant (mdr) esbl-producing  strain klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603) and other medically important pathogens. synthesis of agnps was confirmed by change in pale yellow color to dark brown color and characteristic absorption spectra at 420 nm. the xrd spectrum displayed typical peaks of crystalline silver and edax analysis showed a major signal for silver. ftir spectra revealed prominent peaks at 3,294 cm-1 (nh  stretching due to amide group), 2,952 cm-1 (aldehydic c-h stretching) 1,658 cm-1  indicating the presence of carbonyl group. agnps were spherical in shape with size ranging from 20 to 70 nm. the synthesized agnps showed significant antimicrobial activity against standard esbl pathogen k. pneumoniae (22 mm), 21 mm against clinical esbl isolate e. coli and 16 mm against clinical esbl isolates k. pneumoniae and citrobacter species, respectively. the results of this study suggest that agnps synthesized by streptomyces sp. vitsjk10 can be used as a potential alternative to control mdr esbl pathogens. the present study aimed for  green synthesis of agnps using streptomyces species and to explore its anti-esbl  activity.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == prevalence of community acquired urinary tract infections in silchar medical college, assam, india and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
AB  == background: this study was conducted to know the rate of prevalence of community  acquired uti infections in both males and females, assam, north-east india. materials and methods: a 50 mul of urine sample from each of the subjects was streaked on cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient agar medium. the plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees c. pure, isolated colonies of each type was separately cultured and characterized. the susceptibility of the clinical isolates to routinely prescribed antibiotics in the hospital was performed against various antibiotics. results: of the total 40 patients, 26 positive samples were obtained of which 19 females (73.07%) and 7 male (26.92%) patients were shown to be urine culture positive. the most commonly isolated bacterium was escherichia coli with a frequency rate of (33.3%) followed by staphyloccous aureus (22.2%), klebsiella pnemoniae (11.1%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (7.4%), pseudomonas sp. (7.4%), proteus myxofaciens (3.7%), proteus mirabilis (3.7%), edwardsiella tarda (3.7%), morganella morganii (3.7%), and citrobacter fruendii (3.7%). analysis of the samples showed that uti was more common in females of younger age group as compared with males. it was also observed that the patients responded effectively to imepenem (ie), cepefime, amikacin, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole antimicrobial agents against gram-negative bacilli. furthermore, the most effective antibiotics against gram-positive cocci was found to be ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, ie, and penicillin g (benzyl penicillin). conclusions: antibiotics have been in use for a long period and more often the misuse of antimicrobial drugs has today led to a general rise in the emergence of resistant bacteria.

TI  == amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance in fecal enterobacteriaceae from patients  with cystic fibrosis and healthy siblings.
AB  == background: the present study set out to detect and identify amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae in fecal samples of two patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and their respective siblings. methods: fecal enterobacteriaceae were enumerated onto emb agar containing amoxicillin (amx). a total of 173 cf isolates and 41 sibling isolates were grouped into seven matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) clusters and identified through 16s rrna and rpob sequence analysis. results: the fecal microbiota of patients with cf revealed a higher prevalence of amx resistant enterobacteriaceae compared to that of their healthy  siblings. whereas all selected isolates of healthy siblings were assigned to escherichia coli, isolates of patients with cf belonged to klebsiella oxytoca (58.4%), e. coli (28.3%), klebsiella variicola (7.5%) or citrobacter sp. (5.8%).  all tested cf isolates showed a high resistance rate to amx, and a lower level of resistance to the combination with clavulanic acid. in contrast, all tested sibling isolates were susceptible for both amx and amc. conclusion: the higher abundance of amx resistance in the investigated patients with cf suggests that frequent amc administration may be one of the major contributing factors in the proliferation of enterobacteriaceae and the development of resistant strains in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == enterobacterial detection and escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance in parrots seized from the illegal wildlife trade.
AB  == enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility  of the escherichia coli isolates cultured. fecal samples were collected from 300  parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in goias, brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. a total of 508 isolates  were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 e. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 hafnia  aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. these results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers  of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including e. coli strains with antimicrobial  resistance.

AB  == the molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in jinan, china. out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance  were found. these isolates were classified into 19 rep-pcr types. these strains were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing and found to be as follows: proteus mirabilis (16), escherichia coli (7), providencia spp. (7), proteus spp.  (2), p. vulgaris (3), shigella sp. (1), citrobacter freundii (1), and acinetobacter sp. (1). their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and  then either analyzed using pcr-rflp or sequenced. the typical array dfra1-sat2-aada1 was detected in 27 isolates. six atypical arrays were observed,  including three kinds of novel arrangements (linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1-orf441 or linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1, dfra1-catb2-sat2-aada1, and estx(vr)-sat2-aada1) and a hybrid with the 3'cs of class 1 integrons (dfra1-sat2-aada1-qach), and dfra1-sat1. twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. results showed that water sources in the jinan  region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in jiaozhou bay, china.
AB  == diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of jiaozhou bay, china. five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by pcr  amplification, including qnra3 gene in a shewanella algae isolate, qnrb9 gene in  a citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrd gene in 22 proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrs1  gene in 1 enterobacter sp. and 4 klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrs2 gene in 1 pseudomonas sp. and 4 pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. the qnrc, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qepa genes could not be detected in this study. the 22 qnrd-positive proteus  vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on eric-pcr assay. the qnrs1 and qnrd genes could be transferred to escherichia coli j53 azi(r) or e. coli top10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the qrdrs of gyra protein (ala67ser, ser83ile, or ser83thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(cmy), bla(oxy), bla(shv), and bla(tem) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrb9 or qnrs1 gene. our current study is the first identification of qnrs2 gene in pseudoalteromonas and pseudomonas strains, and qnrd gene in proteus vulgaris strains. high prevalence of diverse qnr genes in jiaozhou bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.

TI  == immunization of mice with lactobacillus casei expressing a beta-intimin fragment  reduces intestinal colonization by citrobacter rodentium.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries. intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the tir receptor exposed on cell surfaces. here, lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of beta-intimin (l. casei-int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen citrobacter rodentium. oral or sublingual immunization of c57bl/6 mice with l. casei-int(cv) induced anti-int(cv) iga in feces but no igg in sera. conversely, anti-int(cv) igg was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified int(cv).  all vaccines were able to decrease c. rodentium recovery from feces. however, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with l. casei-int(cv) by the sublingual route. these mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (il-6) and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of c3h/hepas mice, which are highly susceptible to c. rodentium infection, with l. casei-int(cv) induced anti-int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed  that c. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from c3h/hepas mice immunized with l. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with l. casei-int(cv.) the results indicate that vaccines composed of l. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the c3h/hepas infection model with c. rodentium can be used to  evaluate potential vaccines against epec.

TI  == rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in madagascar.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (esbl-pe) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. in recent years, community-acquired infections due to esbl-pe have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including madagascar. objectives: this study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of esbl-pe in the community of antananarivo. methods: non-hospitalized patients were recruited  in three health centers in different socio economic settings. fresh stool collected were immediately plated on drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. gram-negative bacilli species were identified and esbl production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. characterization of esbls were perfomed by pcr and direct sequencing. molecular epidemiology was analysed by rep-pcr and eric-pcr. results: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 esbl-pe were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). the isolates included escherichia coli (31), klebsiella pneumoniae (14), enterobacter cloacae (3), citrobacter freundii (3), kluyvera spp. (1) and pantoae sp. (1). in multivariate  analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with esbl-pe carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. conclusions: the prevalence of carriage of esbl in the community of  antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. this alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.

TI  == analysis of the dna region mediating increased thermotolerance at 58 degrees c in cronobacter sp. and other enterobacterial strains.
AB  == cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens associated with serious infections in neonates. the increased stress tolerance, including thermoresistance, of some  cronobacter strains can promote their survival in production facilities and thus  raise the possibility of contamination of dried infant milk formula, which has been identified as a potential source of infection. in this study, we characterized a dna region which is present in some cronobacter strains and which contributes to their prolonged survival at 58 degrees c. the 18 kbp long region containing 22 open reading frames was sequenced in cronobacter sakazakii atcc 29544. the major feature of the region contained a cluster of conserved genes, most of them having significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation and acid stress. the same thermoresistance dna region was detected in strains belonging to the genera cronobacter, enterobacter, citrobacter and escherichia and its presence positively correlated with increased thermotolerance.

AB  == conjugative mating between the selenate-reducing bacterium citrobacter sp. strain jsa and escherichia coli s17-1 harboring the broad-host-range plasmid pkt230 or pkt240 (incq) allowed genetic transfer to strain jsa at a maximum frequency of 2.5x10(-5) (pkt230) and 5.1x10(-6) (pkt240) per recipient jsa cell. kanamycin-resistant (selection marker of pkt230 and pkt240) transconjugants were  routinely obtained with this method, and we confirmed that both vectors were also successfully transferred and replicated in strain jsa without alteration of the replicon. furthermore, an electroporation method has also allowed transformation  of jsa at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6) transformants per mug vector dna (per recipient cell), and pcr and hybridization analyses revealed that pkt230 and pkt240 are stably maintained in transformed jsa cells. these results indicated that both inq plasmids can be used as vectors for gene transfer to selenate-reducing strain jsa. this is the first study to demonstrate an effective method for genetic transfer in a selenate-reducing citrobacter bacterium and will aid in the elucidation of the selenium oxyanion reduction mechanism in this genus of environmental selenate-respiring isolates.

TI  == a small-molecule inhibitor of the bacterial type iii secretion system protects against in vivo infection with citrobacter rodentium.
AB  == the type iii secretion system (t3ss) is highly conserved in many gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and functions as an injector of bacterial proteins (effectors) into host cells. t3sss are involved in establishing disease processes, but this machinery is not essential for bacterial growth or homeostasis. thus, t3ss is expected to be a candidate therapeutic target, and inhibitors of t3sss could potentially reduce virulence without causing bacterial  death, thereby avoiding any subsequent development of resistance. we identified a linear polyketide compound, aurodox, as a specific t3ss inhibitor from the culture broth of streptomyces sp. using a screening system for the t3ss-mediated  hemolysis of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) established by our group. aurodox strongly inhibited t3ss-mediated hemolysis with an ic(50) value of 1.5 mug ml(-1) without affecting bacterial growth in liquid media. we also demonstrated that aurodox specifically inhibits the secretion of type iii-secreted proteins such as espb, espf and map, without affecting the expression of the housekeeping protein groel. furthermore, an in vivo infection study using mice clearly indicated that the administration of aurodox allowed the mice to survive a lethal dose of citrobactor rodentium, a model bacterium for human pathogens such as epec. thus, our in vivo study directly demonstrated for the first time that this putative t3ss inhibitor can be applied as a novel class  of anti-infective agents.

AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from duganella sp. b2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  == violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and  antifungal activities. however, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. in order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of duganella sp. b2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. the gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from duganella sp. b2, and  three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the t7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter palkb. our results showed that violacein could be  stably synthesized in e. coli, c. freundii, and e. aerogenes. interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant  c. freundii strain reached 1.68 g l(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other  groups. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.

AB  == pseudomonas luteola (formerly classified as cdc group ve-1 and named chryseomonas luteola) is an unusual pathogen implicated in rare but serious infections in humans. a novel beta-lactamase gene, bla(lut-1), was cloned from the whole-cell dna of the p. luteola clinical isolate lam, which had a weak narrow-spectrum beta-lactam-resistant phenotype, and expressed in escherichia coli. this gene encoded lut-1, a 296-amino-acid ambler class a beta-lactamase with a pi of 6 and  a theoretical molecular mass of 28.9 kda. the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme was higher for cephalothin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime than for penicillins. it was found to be 49% to 59% identical to other ambler class a beta-lactamases from burkholderia sp. (pena to penl), ralstonia eutropha (reut), citrobacter sedlakii  (sed-1), serratia fonticola (fona and sfc-1), klebsiella sp. (kpc and oxy), and ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. no gene homologous to the regulatory ampr genes of class a beta-lactamases was found in the vicinity of the bla(lut-1) gene. the entire bla(lut-1) coding region was amplified by pcr and sequenced in five other genetically unrelated p. luteola strains (including the p. luteola type strain). a new variant of bla(lut-1) was found for each strain. these genes  (named bla(lut-2) to bla(lut-6)) had nucleotide sequences 98.1 to 99.5% identical to that of bla(lut-1) and differing from this gene by two to four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms. the bla(lut) gene was located on a 700- to 800-kb chromosomal i-ceui fragment, the precise size of this fragment depending on the p. luteola strain.

AB  == the objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (pbs/ic) presenting with symptoms  of uti have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their pbs/ic symptoms. one hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed ic were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. at  the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (bard 14fr female) and cultured for bacteria. eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of pbs/ic was confirmed. a pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (puf) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. after the diagnosis of pbs/ic, all patients received multimodal treatment. patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of uti, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. greater than 10(3) colonies  were considered positive. patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. seventy-two patients (68%) had no uti episodes or flares. the remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54  flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. a single  flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). recurrent uti symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli  (n = 6), proteus mirabilis (n = 1), klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and citrobacter sp. (n = 1). one grew streptococcus sp. there was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or puf scores between groups. this study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed utis in a large group of pbs/ic patients followed longitudinally. these data suggest that only a small number of pbs/ic patients with uti symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). although the symptoms of recurrent uti are prevalent in ic patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent utis is only 6.6%. because the flares of ic are  usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. these data suggest that the symptom flares of ic are not usually associated with recurrent uti and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in ic patients who are culture-negative.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == antifungal and antibacterial activities of araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch heartwood lignans.
AB  == five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an meoh extract from araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. the antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria citrobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi mucor miehei, paecilomyces variotii, ceratocystis pilifera, trametes versicolor, and penicillium notatum, and in addition, the meoh extract was evaluated against aspergillus niger, candida albicans, fusarium moniliforme, f. sporotrichum and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the gram-positive. however, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of t. versicolor and c. pilifera at 300  and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. on the other hand, the meoh extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as t. versicolor, fusarium spp. and trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.

TI  == triphenylmethane reductase from citrobacter sp. strain kctc 18061p: purification, characterization, gene cloning, and overexpression of a functional protein in escherichia coli.
AB  == we purified to homogeneity an enzyme from citrobacter sp. strain kctc 18061p capable of decolorizing triphenylmethane dyes. the native form of the enzyme was  identified as a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of about 31 kda. it catalyzes the nadh-dependent reduction of triphenylmethane dyes, with remarkable  substrate specificity related to dye structure. maximal enzyme activity occurred  at ph 9.0 and 60 degrees c. the enzymatic reaction product of the triphenylmethane dye crystal violet was identified as its leuco form by uv-visible spectral changes and thin-layer chromatography. a gene encoding this enzyme was isolated based on its n-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. the nucleotide sequence of the gene has a single open reading frame encoding 287  amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 30,954 da. although the deduced amino acid sequence displays 99% identity to the hypothetical protein from listeria monocytogenes strain 4b h7858, it shows no overall functional similarity to any known protein in the public databases. at the n terminus, the amino acid sequence has high homology to sequences of nad(p)h-dependent enzymes containing the dinucleotide-binding motif gxxgxxg. the enzyme was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant enzyme showed characteristics similar to those of the native enzyme. this is the first report of a triphenylmethane reductase characterized from any organism.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  == 'enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain salmonella serotypes, notably: salmonella typhi, a gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, salmonella paratyphi a, b and c. in addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". brucella sp., campylobacter sp., edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia alcalifaciens, pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens, francisella sp. and yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever this is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of citrobacter to be reported  presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in thailand.

TI  == detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in norway and usa were screened for the presence of the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), bla(ampc), bla(cfxa), and bla(cepa/cbla) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified dna. thirty-four of the  53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the pcr assays. all beta-lactamase-producing prevotella and capnocytophaga spp. were cfxa positive. tem-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of escherichia coli and neisseria sp., and one strain of citrobacter freundii possessed an ampc-type  beta-lactamase. screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. sequence analyses showed that most cfxa positive prevotella and capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the cfxa2 and cfxa3 enzyme. the present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.

TI  == isolation of citrobacter sp. mutants defective in decolorization of brilliant green by transposon mutagenesis.
AB  == to identify genes involved in the decolorization of brilliant green, we isolated  random mutants generated by transposon insertion in brilliant green-decolorizing  bacterium, citrobacter sp. the resulting mutant bank yielded 19 mutants with a complete defect in terms of the brilliant green color removing ability. southern  hybridization with a tn5 fragment as a probe showed a single hybridized band in 7 mutants and these mutants appeared to have insertions at different sites of the chromosome. tn5-inserted genes were isolated and the dna sequence flanking tn5 was determined. by comparing these with a sequence database, putative protein products encoded by bg genes were identified as follows: bg 3 as a lysr-type regulatory protein; bg 11 as a malg protein in the maltose transport system; bg 14 as an oxidoreductase; and bg 17 as an abc transporter. the sequences deduced from the three bg genes, bg 2, bg 7 and bg 16, showed no significant similarity to any protein with a known function, suggesting that these three bg genes may encode unidentified proteins responsible for the decolorization of brilliant green.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. esbl producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. as information on esbl producers causing urinary tract infection (uti) is not available from our country, the occurrence of esbl producing strains causing uti was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of esbl and non-esbl producers. methods: urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by stoke's method and esbl production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). the clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. results: sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were esbl producers. approximately 38.5 per cent of klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of escherichia coli, 24 per cent of enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of proteus sp. and the only citrobacter strain produced esbl. recent surgery was found to be a significant (p < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of esbls. approximately 30 per cent of the esbl producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. there was no difference between the esbl producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. interpretation & conclusion: a high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced esbl. since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for esbl production routinely to avoid treatment failures.

AB  == the distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria was investigated in windermere (cumbria, uk), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. culturable is1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in windermere north basin (wnb) and south basin (wsb), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in wsb and to a depth of 12-13 cm in wnb). polymerase chain reaction amplification of is1 and the escherichia coli/shigella  sp. specific gene uida, from community dna from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. this detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from wnb as is1 and uida were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. analysis of a representative subset of 90 is1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous is1 profiles with estimated  copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to enterobacter spp. however, this study showed is1 to be present in citrobacter freundii for the first time. plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried is1. dna sequence analysis of five is1 clones demonstrated that is1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known is1 isoforms. two isoforms of is1 from a single enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.

(34 samples), staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), proteus sp. (11), pseudomonas sp. (11), klebsiella sp. (8), enterobacter sp. (6), citrobacter sp. (3), and acinetobacter sp. (1). the uropathogenic e. coli strains found were p-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, sds-page of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (tem). all e. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 mic). our results showed that: 1) p-fimbriated e. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute uti (34%); 2) exposure to sub-mics of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production  in 79% of e. coli strains; 3) the pattern of sds-page fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the  protein at 18 kd known as p-fimbriae.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the use of escherichia coli bearing a phon gene for the removal of uranium and nickel from aqueous flows.
AB  == a citrobacter sp. originally isolated from metal-polluted soil accumulates heavy  metals via metalphosphate deposition utilizing inorganic phosphate liberated via  phon phosphatase activity. further strain development was limited by the non-transformability of this environmental isolate. recombinant escherichia coli  dh5 alpha bearing cloned phon or the related phoc acquired metal-accumulating ability, which was compared with that of the citrobacter sp. with respect to removal of uranyl ion (uo2(2+)) from dilute aqueous flows and its deposition in the form of polycrystalline hydrogen uranyl phosphate (huo2po4). subsequently, huo2po4-laden cells removed ni2+ from dilute aqueous flows via intercalation of ni2+ into the huo2po4 lattice. despite comparable acid phosphatase activity in all three strains, the e. coli dh5 alpha (phon) construct was superior to citrobacter n14 in both uranyl and nickel accumulation, while the e. coli dh5 alpha (phoc) construct was greatly inferior in both respects. expression of phosphatase activity alone is not the only factor that permits efficient and prolonged metal phosphate accumulation, and the data highlight possible differences in the phon and phoc phosphatases, which are otherwise considered to  be related in many respects.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == coliforms and salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in fortaleza (ceara, brazil).
AB  == the bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of fortaleza (ceara, brasil), including the coastal zones of the ceara and coco rivers, were examined. the study was conducted during june, september and december 1993, and march 1994. the region was divided into two areas: (i) direct influence area (dia), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) indirect influence area (iia), located near to the coastal zone, including barra do ceara, kartodromo, volta de jurema, mucuripe, farol and caca e pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. the most probable number (mpn) of both total and fecal coliforms in dia was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. the following bacteria were identified: citrobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli. kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. results of total fecal mpn was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at caca e pesca beach. in december, at both dia and iia, salmonella was identified in several samples. in dia, the spatial distribution for salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. in iia, salmonella was identified at kartodromo and farol beaches throughout the sampling period.

TI  == purification and characterization of acid-type phosphatases from a heavy-metal-accumulating citrobacter sp.
AB  == an acid phosphatase from a heavy-metal-accumulating strain of a citrobacter sp. was resolved into two forms on the basis of their nonbinding (phosphatase i) or binding (phosphatase ii) behaviour on the cation-exchange resin sp-sephadex c50.  both holoenzymes had a molecular mass of 103-108 kda as determined by superose q-6 column chromatography in the presence of 150 mm kcl and a subunit molecular mass of 27 kda as determined by sds-page; the enzyme was tetrameric. both enzymes had a pi approximately 9.0 and were immunologically cross-reactive. there were minor differences in amino acid composition and in peptide maps following tryptic digest. the ph optimum for phosphatases i and ii was 5.5 and 6.25, respectively;  phosphatase ii alone retained activity at ph values up to 9.0. phosphatase i was  more resistant to mechanical shear, gamma-irradiation, high temperature, and toxins (f- and formaldehyde). glycerol increased the thermostability of both enzymes, particularly the more thermosensitive phosphatase ii. phosphatase ii had a lower km and a lower vmax for glycerol 2-phosphate hydrolysis. the production of enzyme isoforms is a phenomenon similar to that described previously for the alkaline phosphatase of escherichia coli, where the isoforms relate to precursive and final processed forms of the enzyme. acid phosphatase is physiologically distinct, with a role that is still obscure but that may relate to cellular stress responses.

TI  == bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural ethiopian setting, jimma zone, south west ethiopia.
AB  == a community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from november 1994 to august 1995 in six peasant associations, jimma zone. the households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets  water from unprotected sources. the predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. these and other foods given to weaning age children were  found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. the most frequent bacterial isolates were enterobacter sp, gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp.,  and escherichia coli in that order. various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. this calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.

AB  == bacterial cultures from 1801 human diarrhoeal faecal specimens were examined for  verocytotoxins i and ii by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich elisas. of the 68 elisa-positive cultures selected from initial screening, 32 were positive by elisa on repeat or from freshly grown cultures. elisa-positive pure cultures were obtained from 13 of these, of which seven were confirmed as verocytotoxin positive by cytotoxicity assay. these seven strains were typed as o26 (5) and o146 (2). the six false positive results were from isolates of enterobacter sp. (1), citrobacter freundii (1) and escherichia coli (4), one each of types o1, o18ac and o98 and an untypable strain. despite the occurrence of false positive reactions, sandwich elisa was a useful method for the rapid screening of samples, and detected verocytotoxin-positive e. coli strains, other than o157, from patients with clinical conditions in which they could be implicated.

TI  == slya, a regulatory protein from salmonella typhimurium, induces a haemolytic and  pore-forming protein in escherichia coli.
AB  == a chromosomal fragment from salmonella typhimurium, when cloned in escherichia coli, generates a haemolytic phenotype. this fragment carries two genes, termed slya and slyb. the expression of slya is sufficient for the haemolytic phenotype. the haemolytic activity of e. coli carrying multiple copies of slya is found mainly in the cytoplasm, with some in the periplasm of cells grown to stationary  phase, but overexpression of slyb, a 15 kda lipoprotein probably located in the outer membrane, may lead to enhanced, albeit unspecific, release of the haemolytic activity into the medium. polyclonal antibodies raised against a purified slya-hlya fusion protein identified the overexpressed monomeric 17 kda slya protein mainly in the cytoplasm of e. coli grown to stationary phase, although smaller amounts were also found in the periplasm and even in the culture supernatant. however, the anti-slya antibodies reacted with the slya protein in a periplasmic fraction that did not contain the haemolytic activity. conversely, the periplasmic fraction exhibiting haemolytic activity did not contain the 17 kda slya protein. furthermore, s. typhimurium transformed with multiple copies of the slya gene did not show a haemolytic phenotype when grown in rich culture media, although the slya protein was expressed in amounts similar to those in the recombinant e. coli strain. these results indicate that slya is not itself a cytolysin but rather induces in e. coli (but not in s. typhimurium) the synthesis of an uncharacterised, haemolytically active protein which forms pores with a diameter of about 2.6 nm in an artificial lipid bilayer. the slya protein thus seems to represent a regulation factor in salmonella, as is also suggested by the similarity of the slya protein to some other bacterial regulatory proteins. slya- and slyb-related genes were also obtained by pcr from e. coli, shigella sp. and citrobacter diversus but not from several other gram-negative bacteria tested.

TI  == copper-resistant enteric bacteria from united kingdom and australian piggeries.
AB  == thirty-three enteric isolates from australian (escherichia coli only) and united  kingdom (u.k.) (salmonella sp., citrobacter spp., and e. coli) piggeries were characterized with respect to their copper resistance. the copper resistance phenotypes of four new australian e. coli isolates were comparable with that of the previously studied e. coli k-12 strain ed8739(prj1004), in that the resistance level in rich media was high (up to 18 mm cuso4) and resistance was inducible. copper resistance was transferable by conjugation from the new australian isolates to e. coli k-12 recipients. dna similarity between the new australian isolates and the pco copper resistance determinant located on plasmid  prj1004 was strong as measured by dna-dna hybridization; however, the copper resistance plasmids were nonidentical as indicated by the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms between the plasmids. dna-dna hybridization and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated dna homology between the pco determinant and dna from the u.k.e. coli, salmonella sp., and citrobacter freundii isolates. however, the copper resistance level and inducibility were variable among the u.k. strains. of the u.k. e. coli isolates, 1 demonstrated a high level of copper resistance, 4 exhibited intermediate resistance, and 16 showed a low level of copper resistance; all of these resistances were expressed  constitutively. a single u.k. c. freundii isolate, had a high level of copper resistance, inducible by subtoxic levels of copper. transconjugants from one e. coli and one c. freundii donor, with e. coli k-12 strain ub1637 as a recipient, showed copper resistance levels and inducibility of resistance which differed from that expressed from plasmid prj1004.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

TI  == ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  == a prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. all patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. in 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. in two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. subsequently, 17 patients died. the cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens) and enterococci. ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial  spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well  suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of enterobacteriaceae  (50 escherichia coli, 48 klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 enterobacter cloacae, 32 proteus mirabilis, 22 proteus indole-positive [providencia sp.], 24 serratia sp., and 12 citrobacter sp. all strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. in addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/ml. the highest intrinsic activity was observed against proteus sp. tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. it is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.

AB  == tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. thirty-two strains of pseudomonas and 960 strains of enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and salmonella enterica). tigemonam displayed good activity against enterobacteriaceae. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were as follows: mic50s were 0.01 mg/l for p. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/l for s. marcescens, mic90s were 0.03 mg/l for p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and 4 mg/l for citrobacter freundii. tigemonam inhibited e. coli and p. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. despite mic90s of 9.5 and 4 mg/l for enterobacter and c. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. tigemonam was found to be inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with mic50s and mic90s higher than 128 mg/l (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/l). tigemonam's activity was found to  be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against p. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (mic90, 8 mg/l for norfloxacin; mic50, 8 mg/l and mic90, 32 mg/l for aztreonam). cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested.

TI  == antibacterial activity of tigemonam dicholate (sq 30836) and interaction with beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == sq 30836 is an orally absorbed salt of tigemonam, a new monobactam similar to aztreonam in structure and microbiologic properties. when assayed against 400 clinical isolates, tigemonam's activity was similar to that of aztreonam and carumonam. it was highly effective against enterobacteriaceae but showed poor activity against gram-positive organisms. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella, shigella, yersinia, proteus, providencia, and morganella strains at 0.5 micrograms/ml or less, and all salmonella and hafnia strains at 1 micrograms/ml or less. citrobacter, enterobacter, and serratia strains were less  susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations [mic30] of 2, 32, and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). the activity of the new compound against enterobacteriaceae is comparable with and often higher than that of third-generation cephalosporins and oral comparison compounds. in contrast to aztreonam, tigemonam had minimal activity against pseudomonas sp and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. data suggest that poor penetration through  the outer membranes of pseudomonas sp may be responsible for this failure. tigemonam was stable to hydrolysis by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the kl enzyme of klebsiella and by the proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. also, measurement of the ic50 (concentration of inhibitor able to reduce the activity of the enzyme by 59%) showed that tigemonam has less affinity than aztreonam for class i cephalosporinases. however, only levels of beta-lactamase, not hydrolysis rates or affinity, correlated to mics of the two monobactams for the resistant enterobacter and citrobacter strains.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == ten patients, 6 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 53 years, having pyogenic liver abscess, were studied to review the principal features of the clinical and  bacteriological diagnosis. in 9 cases the abscess was located in the right hepatic lobe. bacteriological diagnosis was made in 6 cases: the etiology was nonmicrobian in 3 and two microorganisms were found in the other 3 cases. the isolated pathogens were: escherichia coli (3 cases), staphylococcus sp (3 cases), enterobacter agglomerans (1 case), citrobacter sp (1 case), streptococcus sp (1 case). the basic clinical pattern included fever in 9 patients, pain in upper right side of the abdomen in 8, jaundice in 5 and respiratory symptoms in 5. in 2 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography, in 2 by scintigraphy and in 3 both methods were used. surgical drainage was practiced in 7 patients, with favorable course in 6. three patients were not operated; 2 died and the third was cured with medical treatment. the importance of the clinical suspicion even with  few data is pointed out, specially prolonged fever with painful syndrome in upper right side of the abdomen. the aid of the diagnosis imaging is valuable for verification. the precise bacteriological diagnosis by culture of the material obtained in surgery or by percutaneous drainage of the abscess allows the selection of the most suitable antibiotic therapy.

TI  == use of aztreonam in patients suffering from urinary tract infections with contraindications for the use of aminoglycosides.
AB  == the clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. duration of therapy was 2-8 days. bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: escherichia coli (60%); proteus mirabilis (10%); pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter sp. (7%); proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens; klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas species (3%). at completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. no significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. it is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

AB  == beta-lactamase was isolated from the cells of e. coli, strain 1039, a transconjugant carrying the plasmid first detected in citrobacter sp. beta-lactamase was purified to obtain a homogeneous preparation. the activity of  the enzyme was estimated by a modification of the potentiometric method providing determination of up to 0.1 mumol of penicilloinic acid. the activity of the pure  enzyme was 206 mumol per 1 mg of protein per minute. the molecular weight determined by gel filtration was 21500. the substrate profile of beta-lactamase corresponded to the tem type. preliminary incubation with methicillin resulted in a significant decrease in the enzyme activity. carbenicillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin and cephalothin induced no decrease in the activity of the enzyme when  subjected to preliminary incubation with it. the use of the functional group reagents allowed detecting residues of serine and lysine in the enzyme active centre or close to it. km and kcat for some antibiotics were evaluated. the ratio of alpha- and beta-structures in the molecule of beta-lactamase was determined with the method of circular dichroism (cd). the fraction of the alpha-spiral areas amounted to 30 +/- 5 per cent and the fraction of beta-structures amounted  to 20 +/- 5 per cent. on attachment of methicillin to the molecule of the enzyme  the ratio of alpha- and beta-structures did not change which may be considered as a preliminary indication of the centre "immobility" in the process of catalysis.  slow hydroysis of methicillin by beta-lactamase was shown with the method of cd.

AB  == dissimilatory reduction of no(2) to n(2)o and nh(4) by a soil citrobacter sp. was studied in an attempt to elucidate the physiological and ecological significance  of n(2)o production by this mechanism. in batch cultures with defined media, no(2) reduction to nh(4) was favored by high glucose and low no(3) concentrations. nitrous oxide production was greatest at high glucose and intermediate no(3) concentrations. with succinate as the energy source, little or no no(2) was reduced to nh(4) but n(2)o was produced. resting cell suspensions reduced no(2) simultaneously to n(2)o and free extracellular nh(4). chloramphenicol prevented the induction of n(2)o-producing activity. the k(m) for no(2) reduction to n(2)o was estimated to be 0.9 mm no(2), yet the apparent k(m)  for overall no(2) reduction was considerably lower, no greater than 0.04 mm no(2). activities for n(2)o and nh(4) production increased markedly after depletion of no(3) from the media. amendment with no(3) inhibited n(2)o and nh(4) production by molybdate-grown cells but not by tungstate-grown cells. sulfite inhibited production of nh(4) but not of n(2)o. in a related experiment, three escherichia coli mutants lacking nadh-dependent nitrite reductase produced n(2)o  at rates equal to the wild type. these observations suggest that n(2)o is produced enzymatically but not by the same enzyme system responsible for dissimilatory reduction of no(2) to nh(4).

TI  == poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects rna from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
AB  == short lengths (18 residues) of poly(a), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of escherichia coli 5 s rrna, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of rnaases (ribonucleases) from citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. as the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. furthermore, poly(a) sequences, present only  on a small subpopulation of rna, and accounting for less than 1% of total rna, serve to protect all rna, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. the quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the  amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. the exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(a) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of rnaase activity, by using linked poly(a) and similar quantities of free poly(a), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits rnaase activity, covalent linkage of poly(a) to rna is more advantageous to the stability of an rna substrate. however, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(a) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.

AB  == fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (brl 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. ticarcillin mics were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. thirty-nine strains of enterobacteriaceae tested included escherichia coli (14), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), citrobacter sp. (3), enterobacter sp. (3), salmonella enteritidis (1), serratia marcescens (1), and proteus mirabilis (1). ticarcillin mics for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. against 33 strains (85%), the mics were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. in contrast, the mics for seven of eight strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (mic >/= 2,048 mug/ml) e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, and p. mirabilis.

TI  == [efficacy, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of sisomicin in urinary tract infections (author's transl)].
AB  == since 1973 30 patients with urinary tract infections (uti) or pyelonephritis have been treated with sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside, in a daily dose of 2 mg/kg for a period of seven to nine days. from a clinical point of view the result of treatment was good. complete resolution was achieved in 17 patients, improvement  in nine, and there was no effect in four patients. thirty-five causative organisms (escherichia coli = 23, proteus sp. = 7, klebsiella sp. = 3, pseudomonas aeruginosa = 1, citrobacter = 1) were isolated before treatment. thirty of the organisms were eliminated during treatment, but seven reappeared during the follow-up period; five strains persisted. side effects observed consisted of reversible increase of serum creatinine in four patients, excretion  of granular casts in 14 patients, and a transient rise of alkaline phosphatase, sgot and/or sgpt in five patients. no signs of ototoxicity or any other adverse reactions were found and local tolerance was good. in 20 patients blood samples for assay were obtained daily one hour after i. m. injection of 1.0 mg/kg. no evidence of drug accumulation in the serum was found: the mean serum concentrations one hour after injection remained between 3.4 and 3,9 microgram/ml during the entire treatment period. sisomicin is a highly effective antibiotic for the treatment of uti caused by gramnegative pathogens. on account of its potential toxicity however, it should be used, like other aminoglycosides, only in selected cases.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in the compromised host.
AB  == the clinical and radiological characteristics of 217 consecutive episodes of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia occurring in 189 adult cancer patients between  november 1968 and december 1974 were analyzed. the majority of patients had acute leukemia (54%). fever larger than or equal to 101 degrees f was the single most common symptom and sign of the presence of infection (90%). next in frequency were crepitant rales (65%), cough (41%), dyspnea (19%) and chest pain (18%). radiographic evidence of pneumonia was found in 83% of cases and it consisted mainly of alveolar infiltrates involving both lung fields and predominantly the bases. up to one-third of the patients had normal chestx-ray examinations at the  onset of infection, though they subsequently became abnormal in 42% of them. the  majority of patients (81%) whose initial chest x-rays did not reveal the presence of pneumonia were neutropenic (less than 1000 circumlating neutrophils/mm3). klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas sp. were the most common infecting organisms. the  overall cure rate was 61%; 70% for klebsiella sp. infections and 64% for pseudomonas sp. infections. pulmonary abscesses occurred in 14% of the cases. cures were related to the antibiotic sensitivity of the infecting organisms and to the number of circulating neutrophils during the period of infection. best results were obtained with the administration of gentamicin, the newer aminoglycoside antibiotic sisomicin, tobramycin and amikacin, or the combination  of gentamicin with carbenicillin or with cephalosporins. early and vigorous therapy of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics has improved the prognosis of this infection at our institution.

TI  == two distinct types of trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase specified by r-plasmids of different compatibility groups.
AB  == r-plasmids from a number of trimethoprim-resistant escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. were studied after transfer to e. coli k12 hosts. each was found  to specify a dihydrofolate reductase which was resistant to trimethoprim and methotrexate, and which could be completely separated from the host chromosomal enzyme by gel filtration. two distinct types of r-plasmid dihydrofolate reductases were identified. type i enzymes, typified by the r483 enzyme previously described (skold, o., and widh, a. (1974) j. biol. chem. 249, 4324-4325), are synthesized in amounts severalfold higher than the chromosomal enzyme. the 50% inhibitory concentrations (i50) of trimethoprim, methotrexate, and aminopterin are increased several thousandfold over the corresponding values  for the chromosomal enzyme. type ii r-plasmid dihydrofolate reductases are synthesized in about the same amount, or less, as the chromosomal enzyme, but are practically several hundredfold higher than those for the type i enzymes. both types of r-plasmid dihydrofolate reductase showed little difference from the chromosomal enzyme in the binding of dihydrofolate, nadph, folic acid, and 2,4-diaminopyrimidine.

TI  == bactericidal factor produced by haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  == when aerobically grown on complex media, haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other haemophilus species and certain genera of the enterobacteriaceae. a total of 341 clinical isolates of haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. ninety-three percent of h. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of h. haemolyticus, 71% of h. parainfluenzae, and 22% of h. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. h. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and h. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. only one strain each of h. aegyptius and h. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of escherichia coli, 85% of salmonella sp., and all citrobacter sp., shigella sp., and yersinia  sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by h. influenzae b. attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. however, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown h. influenzae b by a series of extractions. the ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. the converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed h. influenzae rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of h. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of h. influenzae b.

TI  == biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  == normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on  serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. gaffkya tetragena and bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and proteus mirabilis and micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and toolan's h-1 viruses, and theiler's gdvii antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for gdvii virus in  all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (salmonella, pseudomonas, and citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. the endoparasites found in these agoutis were ascaris, toxascaris, strongyloides, trichuris, and trichomonas.

TI  == immunological relationships of bacterial l-asparaginases.
AB  == rabbit antisera against l-asparaginase preparations from escherichia coli, erwinia carotovora, citrobacter sp. and chromobacterium violaceum showed on immunoelectrophoresis that only the enzymes from e. coli and citrobacter are immunologically related. purified preparations had to be used to determine the immunological cross-reactions. immunoelectrophoresis at different ph values yielded the zero mobility points of the enzymes. the activity of the er. carotovora preparation was enhanced up to fourfold by homologous antiserum but not by normal sera. heterologous antisera also enhanced, but only at a higher concentration. less enhancement was observed for the other enzymes with antisera  as well as with bovine serum albumin. inhibition was not observed.

TI  == [in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  == in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc  and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris.  morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.

TI  == comparison of the rates of motility of salmonella with those of other enteric bacteria.
AB  == comparison of the rates of motility through a semisolid medium of 16 common salmonella sp., 14 escherichia coli serotypes, 4 arizona strains, 2 escherichia freundii (citrobacter) isolates, 2 proteus sp., and 2 pseudomonas sp. revealed the following. (i) very closely related bacteria could demonstrate markedly different rates of progression. (ii) all of the salmonellae tested advanced faster than the proteus and pseudomonas test cultures but some salmonella sp., notably s. choleraesuis and s. typhi, progressed relatively slowly compared to many other test cultures. (iii) the mean rate of motility for the fastest 14 salmonella sp. (1.49 cm/hr) was not statistically greater than the mean value for the 14 e. coli serotypes (1.31 cm/hr) at the 1% level of significance. selective  motility procedures may not be a reliable means of isolating all salmonella sp. from materials contaminated with other bacteria.
