TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2006 to march 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, b. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b. wadsworthia in this order. in this series, we noticed no  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa. there were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various  anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia.
