TI  == expression and crystallization of a bacterial glycoside hydrolase family 116 beta-glucosidase from thermoanaerobacterium xylanolyticum.
AB  == the thermoanaerobacterium xylanolyticum gene product txgh116, a glycoside hydrolase family 116 protein of 806 amino-acid residues sharing 37% amino-acid sequence identity over 783 residues with human glucosylceramidase 2 (gba2), was expressed in escherichia coli. purification by heating, immobilized metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography produced >90% pure txgh116 protein with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kda on sds-page. the purified txgh116 enzyme hydrolyzed the p-nitrophenyl (pnp) glycosides pnp-beta-d-glucoside, pnp-beta-d-galactoside and pnp-n-acetyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, as well as cellobiose and cellotriose. the txgh116 protein was crystallized using a precipitant consisting of 0.6 m sodium citrate tribasic, 0.1 m tris-hcl ph 7.0 by vapour diffusion with micro-seeding to form crystals with maximum dimensions of 120x25x5 microm. the txgh116 crystals diffracted x-rays to 3.15 a resolution and belonged to the monoclinic space group p2(1). structure solution will allow a structural explanation of the effects of human gba2 mutations.
