in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
am-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the antibacterial activity of am-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. the in vivo efficacy of am-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (e. coli and b. fragilis) model of rats. the accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in the am-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent am-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
