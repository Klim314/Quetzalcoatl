TI  - 16S ribosomal RNA-based methods to monitor changes in the hindgut bacterial community of piglets after oral administration of Lactobacillus sobrius S1.
AB  - 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene based PCR/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR were used to monitor the changes in the composition of microbiota in the hindgut of piglets after oral administration of Lactobacillus sobrius S1. Six litters of neonatal piglets were divided randomly into control group and treatment group. At 7, 9, and 11 days of age, piglets in the treatment group orally received a preparation of L. sobrius S1. At 7, 14, 21(weaning), 24, and 35 days of age, one piglet from each litter was sacrificed and digesta samples of hindgut were collected. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene V6-V8 region for all bacteria showed that several populations present in the hindgut of piglets, represented by far-migrating bands, disappeared after weaning. Most of these bands corresponded to Lactobacillus spp. as revealed by sequence analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR specific for lactobacilli further demonstrated that the number of lactobacilli population tended to decrease after the piglets were weaned. Drastic changes of L. amylovorus and L. sobrius in total Lactobacillus populations were also observed in the colon of piglets around weaning, as monitored by 16S rRNA gene V2-V3 region based Lactobacillus-specific PCR-DGGE. Species-specific real-time PCR also revealed that the population of L. sobrius declined apparently in the colon of piglets after weaning. No remarkable changes in the overall microbial community in the hindgut were found between control and treatment groups. However, comparison of DGGE profiles between the two groups revealed a specific band related to Clostridium disporicum that was found in treatment group on day 14. On day 35, a specific band appeared only in the control group, representing a population most closely related to Streptococcus suis (99%). Real-time PCR showed that L. sobrius 16S rRNA gene copies in treatment group were relatively higher than in the control group (10(8.45) vs. 10(6.83)) on day 35, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups.
TI  - [Changes of bacterial flora from hindguts of piglets after oral administration of lactobacillus amylovorus S1 as a probiotic strain].
AB  - Changes of bacterial flora from hindguts of piglets from 7 to 35 days of age (two weeks after weaning) were studied after oral administration of L. amylovorus S1, using molecular techniques based on 16S rDNA gene. Six litters of neonatal piglets were divided randomly into control group and treatment group. At 7, 9, 11 days of age, piglets in treatment group received 1, 2 and 3mL preparation of S1 (5 x 10(9) CFU/mL) through oral administration, respectively. On D 7, 14, 21, 24 and 35, one piglet from each litter was slaughtered and samples of hindguts were collected for analysis. The results showed that high G + C mol% bacteria in hindguts of piglets disappeared after weaning and restored gradually two weeks later. Sequencing analysis indicated that most of these high G + C mol% bacteria blonged to Lactobacillus spp. . Statistical analysis showed that treatment with S1 had no marked effect on diversity index of predominant bacteria from hindguts in piglets. By comparing the bands in DGGE profiles between two groups, a specific band in treatment group was found in profiles from piglets at 14 days of age, sequence matched with that showed 95 % similarity to Clostridium disporicum. At 35 days of age, another specific band appeared in control group, which was identified to be Streptococcus suis (99% ).
