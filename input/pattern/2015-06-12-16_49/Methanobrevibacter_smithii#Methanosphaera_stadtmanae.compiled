TI  - Archaea and the human gut: new beginning of an old story.
AB  - Methanogenic archaea are known as human gut inhabitants since more than 30 years  ago through the detection of methane in the breath and isolation of two methanogenic species belonging to the order Methanobacteriales, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae. During the last decade, diversity of archaea encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has been extended by sequence identification and culturing of new strains. Here we provide an updated census of the archaeal diversity associated with the human GIT and their possible role in the gut physiology and health. We particularly focus on the still poorly characterized 7th order of methanogens, the Methanomassiliicoccales, associated to aged population. While also largely distributed in non-GIT environments, our actual knowledge on this novel order of methanogens has been mainly revealed through GIT inhabitants. They enlarge the number of final electron acceptors of the gut metabolites to mono- di- and trimethylamine. Trimethylamine is exclusively a microbiota-derived product of nutrients (lecithin, choline, TMAO, L-carnitine) from normal diet, from which seems originate two diseases, trimethylaminuria (or Fish-Odor Syndrome) and cardiovascular disease through the proatherogenic property of its oxidized liver-derived form. This therefore supports interest on these methanogenic species and its use as archaebiotics, a term coined from the notion of archaea-derived probiotics.
TI  - Temporal analysis of the effect of extruded flaxseed on the swine gut microbiota.
AB  - Flaxseed is a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid reported to have beneficial health effects in humans. Feeding swine a diet supplemented with flaxseed has been found to enrich pork products with omega-3 fatty acids. However, the effect of flaxseed supplementation on the swine gut microbiota has not been assessed to date. The purpose of this study was to investigate if extruded flaxseed has any impact on the bacterial and archaeal microbiota in the feces of growing-finishing pigs over a 51-day period, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR. Bacterial DGGE profile analysis revealed major temporal shifts in the bacterial microbiota with only minor ones related to diet. The archaeal microbiota was significantly less diverse than that of Bacteria. The majority of bacterial DGGE bands sequenced belonged to the Firmicutes phylum while the archaeal DGGE bands were found to consist of only 2 species, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae. The abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased significantly from day 0 to day 21 in all diet groups while the abundance of Firmicutes was relatively stable across all diet cohorts and sampling times. There was also no significant correlation between pig mass and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. While the addition of extruded flaxseed to the feed of growing-finishing pigs was beneficial for improving omega-3 fatty acid content of pork, it had no detectable impact on the fecal bacterial and archaeal microbiota, suggesting that extruded flaxseed may be used to improve meat quality without adverse effect on the swine gut microbiota or animal performance.
TI  - Biofilm formation of mucosa-associated methanoarchaeal strains.
AB  - Although in nature most microorganisms are known to occur predominantly in consortia or biofilms, data on archaeal biofilm formation are in general scarce. Here, the ability of three methanoarchaeal strains, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae, which form part of the human gut microbiota, and the Methanosarcina mazei strain Go1 to grow on different surfaces and form biofilms was investigated. All three strains adhered to the substrate mica and grew predominantly as bilayers on its surface as demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses, though the formation of multi-layered biofilms of Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii was observed as well. Stable biofilm formation was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. Methanosarcina mazei and Methanobrevibacter smithii also formed multi-layered biofilms in uncoated plastic mu-dishes(TM), which were very similar in morphology and reached a height of up to 40 mum. In contrast, biofilms formed by Methanosphaera stadtmanae reached only a height of 2 mum. Staining with the two lectins ConA and IB4 indicated that all three strains produced relatively low amounts of extracellular polysaccharides most likely containing glucose, mannose, and galactose. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that methanoarchaea can develop and form biofilms on different substrates and thus, will contribute to our knowledge on the appearance and physiological role of Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae in the human intestine.
TI  - The intestinal archaea Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii activate human dendritic cells.
AB  - The methanoarchaea Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii are known to be part of the indigenous human gut microbiota. Although the immunomodulatory effects of bacterial gut commensals have been studied extensively in the last decade, the impact of methanoarchaea in human's health and disease was rarely examined. Consequently, we studied and report here on the effects of M. stadtmanae and M. smithii on human immune cells. Whereas exposure to M. stadtmanae leads to substantial release of proinflammatory cytokines in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), only weak activation was detected after incubation with M. smithii. Phagocytosis of M. stadtmanae by moDCs was demonstrated by confocal microscopy as well as transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and shown to be crucial for cellular activation by using specific inhibitors. Both strains, albeit to different extents, initiate a maturation program in moDCs as revealed by up-regulation of the cell-surface receptors CD86 and CD197 suggesting additional activation of adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, M. stadtmanae and M. smithii were capable to alter the gene expression of antimicrobial peptides in moDCs to different extents. Taken together, our findings strongly argue that the archaeal gut inhabitants M. stadtmanae and M. smithii are specifically recognized by the human innate immune system. Moreover, both strains are capable of inducing an inflammatory cytokine response to different extents arguing that they might have diverse immunomodulatory functions. In conclusion, we propose that the impact of intestinal methanoarchaea on pathological conditions involving the gut microbiota has been underestimated until now.
TI  - Increased prevalence of Methanosphaera stadtmanae in inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is associated with the modulation of mucosal immunity and the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Previous studies focused on the impact of bacterial species on IBD but seldom suspected archaea, which can be a major constituent of intestinal microbiota, to be implicated in the diseases. Recent evidence supports that two main archaeal species found in the digestive system of humans, Methanobrevibacter smithii (MBS) and Methanosphaera stadtmanae (MSS) can have differential immunogenic properties in lungs of mice; with MSS but not MBS being a strong inducer of the inflammatory response. We thus aimed at documenting the immunogenic potential of MBS and MSS in humans and to explore their association with IBD. METHODS: To validate the immunogenicity of MBS and MSS in humans, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects were stimulated with these two microorganisms and the production of inflammatory cytokine TNF was measured by ELISA. To verify MBS and MSS prevalence in IBD, stool samples from 29 healthy control subjects and 29 patients suffering from IBD were collected for DNA extraction. Plasma was also collected from these subjects to measure antigen-specific IgGs by ELISA. Quantitative PCR was used for bacteria, methanogens, MBS and MSS quantification. RESULTS: Mononuclear cells stimulated with MSS produced higher concentrations of TNF (39.5 ng/ml) compared to MBS stimulation (9.1 ng/ml). Bacterial concentrations and frequency of MBS-containing stools were similar in both groups. However, the number of stool samples positive for the inflammatory archaea MSS was higher in patients than in controls (47% vs 20%). Importantly, only IBD patients developed a significant anti-MSS IgG response. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MSS is increased in IBD patients and is associated with an antigen-specific IgG response.
TI  - Diversity of methanogens in the hindgut of captive white rhinoceroses, Ceratotherium simum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The white rhinoceros is on the verge of extinction with less than 20,200 animals remaining in the wild. In order to better protect these endangered animals, it is necessary to better understand their digestive physiology and nutritional requirements. The gut microbiota is nutritionally important for herbivorous animals. However, little is known about the microbial diversity in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the white rhinoceros. Methanogen diversity in the GIT may be host species-specific and, or, function-dependent. To assess methanogen diversity in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses, an archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed from pooled PCR products obtained from the feces of seven adult animals. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of 153 archaeal 16S rRNA sequences revealed 47 unique phylotypes, which were assigned to seven operational taxonomic units (OTUs 1 to 7). Sequences assigned to OTU-7 (64 out of 153 total sequencs - 42%) and OTU-5 (18%, 27/153) had 96.2% and 95.5% identity to Methanocorpusculum labreanum, respectively, making Methanocorpusculum labreanum the predominant phylotype in these white rhynoceroses. Sequences belonging to OTU-6 (27%, 42/153) were related (97.6%) to Methanobrevibacter smithii. Only 4% of the total sequences (6/153) were assigned to Methanosphaera stadtmanae (OTU-1). Sequences belonging to OTU-2 (4%, 6/153), OTU-3 (3%, 5/153) and OTU-4 (2%, 3/153) were distantly related (87.5 to 88,4%) to Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and were considered to be novel species or strains that have yet-to-be cultivated and characterized. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the methanogen species in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses were more similar to those in the hindgut of horses. Our findings may help develop studies on improving the digestibility of forage for sustainable management and better health of these endangered animals.
TI  - Rumen methanogenic genotypes differ in abundance according to host residual feed  intake phenotype and diet type.
AB  - Methane is an undesirable end product of rumen fermentative activity because of associated environmental impacts and reduced host feed efficiency. Our study characterized the rumen microbial methanogenic community in beef cattle divergently selected for phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI) while offered a high-forage (HF) diet followed by a low-forage (LF) diet. Rumen fluid was collected from 14 high-RFI (HRFI) and 14 low-RFI (LRFI) animals at the end of both dietary periods. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were used, and methanogen-specific tag-encoded pyrosequencing was carried out on the samples. We found that Methanobrevibacter spp. are the dominant methanogens in the rumen, with Methanobrevibacter smithii being the most abundant species. Differences in the abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae genotypes were detected in the rumen of animals offered the LF compared to the HF diet while the abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii genotypes was different between HRFI and LRFI animals irrespective of diet. Our results demonstrate that while a core group of methanogen operational taxonomic units (OTUs) exist across diet and phenotype, significant differences were observed in the distribution of genotypes within those OTUs. These changes in genotype abundance may contribute to the observed differences in methane emissions between efficient and inefficient animals.
TI  - Technical note: Comparison of biomarker and molecular biological methods for estimating methanogen abundance.
AB  - Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become a popular method for estimation of methanogen abundance in the ruminant digestive tract. However, there is no established method in terms of primer choice and quantification, which means that results are variable and not directly comparable between studies. Archaeol has been proposed as an alternative marker for methanogen abundance, as it is ubiquitous in methanogenic Archaea, and can be quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The aim of this experiment was to compare total methanogen populations estimated using the new archaeol approach with estimates based on qPCR. Specific primer sets and probes were used to detect dominant ruminal methanogen species Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, and total methanogen populations. There was variation in the relationships among total methanogen abundance estimates based on archaeol and qPCR. In addition, the universal methanogen primers appeared to preferentially amplify genes from M. smithii. Archaeol had the strongest relationship with the dominant rumen methanogen M. ruminantium, whereas the total methanogen primers had a comparatively weak relationship with archaeol. Archaeol analysis was a useful adjunct to molecular biology methods, but it seems that a valid specific primer for M. ruminantium would be more useful than a biased primer for total methanogens.
TI  - In-vitro archaeacidal activity of biocides against human-associated archaea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several methanogenic archaea have been detected in the human intestinal microbiota. These intestinal archaea may contaminate medical devices such as colonoscopes. However, no biocide activity has been reported among these human-associated archaea. METHODOLOGY: The minimal archaeacidal concentration (MAC) of peracetic acid, chlorhexidine, squalamine and twelve parent synthetic derivatives reported in this study was determined against five human-associated methanogenic archaea including Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and two environmental methanogens Methanobacterium beijingense and Methanosaeta concilii by using a serial dilution technique in Hungates tubes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MAC of squalamine derivative S1 was 0.05 mg/L against M. smithii strains, M. oralis, M. arboriphilicus, M. concilii and M. beijingense whereas MAC of squalamine and derivatives S2-S12 varied from 0.5 to 5 mg/L. For M. stadtmanae and M. luminyensis, MAC of derivative S1 was 0.1 mg/L and varied from 1 to >/= 10 mg/L for squalamine and its parent derivatives S2-S12. Under the same experimental conditions, chlorhexidine and peracetic acid lead to a MAC of 0.2 and 1.5 mg/L, respectively against all tested archaea. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Squalamine derivative S1 exhibited a 10-200 higher archaeacidal activity than other tested squalamine derivatives, on the majority of human-associated archaea. As previously reported and due to their week corrosivity and their wide spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal properties, squalamine and more precisely derivative S1 appear as promising compounds to be further tested for the decontamination of medical devices contaminated by human-associated archaea.
TI  - A versatile medium for cultivating methanogenic archaea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanomassilicoccus luminyensis and Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus have been cultured from human digestive microbiota. Each one of these fastidious methanogenic archaea requires a specific medium for its growth, hampering their routine isolation and the culture. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A new culture medium here referred as SAB medium was optimized and tested to cultivate methanogens associated with human microbiota, as well as two mesophile methanogens Methanobacterium beijingense and Methanosaeta concilii. It was further tested for the isolation of archaea from 20 human stool specimens including 10 specimens testing positive for PCR detection of M. smithii. After inoculating 10(5) colony-forming-unit archaea/mL or 1 g stool specimen in parallel in SAB medium and reference DSMZ medium in the presence of negative controls, growth of archaea was determined by optical microscopy and the measurement of methane production by gas chromatography. While the negative controls remained sterile, all tested archaea grew significantly more rapidly in SAB medium than in reference medium in 1-3 days (P<0.05, Student test). Among PCR-positive stool specimens, 10/10 grew in the SAB medium, 6/10 in DSMZ 119 medium, 5/10 in DSMZ 322 medium and 3/10 in DSMZ 334 c medium. Four out of ten PCR-negative stool specimens grew after a 3-week incubation in the SAB-medium whereas no growth was detected in any of the reference media. 16S rRNA gene sequencing yielded 99-100% sequence similarity with reference M. smithii except for one specimen that yielded 99-100% sequence similarity with reference Methanobrevibacter millerae. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SAB medium allows for the versatile isolation and growth of methanogenic archaea associated with human gut microbiota including the archaea missed by inoculation of reference media. Implementation of the SAB medium in veterinary and medical microbiology laboratories will ease the routine culture-based detection of methanogenic archaea in clinical and environmental specimens.
TI  - Hydrophobicity of imidazole derivatives correlates with improved activity against human methanogenic archaea.
AB  - Methanogenic archaea are involved in periodontitis in humans. They have also been implicated in digestive tract pathologies and obesity. These microorganisms are broadly resistant to antibiotics, except for metronidazole and ornidazole. In this study, eight imidazole derivatives were synthesised and their in vitro cytotoxicity and activity against six species of methanogenic archaea, including Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanobacterium beijingense, Methanosaeta concilii and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, were tested. Whilst the effective half-maximum cytotoxic concentrations (EC50 values) of all compounds were </=50 mg/L, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 0.05-0.8 mg/L for most methanogenic archaea and 0.1-1mg/L for M. stadtmanae. These results indicated a >20-400 therapeutic index (EC50/MIC) for these compounds, which compared with metronidazole exhibited 1-log increased activity against methanogenic archaea cultured from the human microbiota. These compounds are therefore promising molecules for the treatment of methanogenic archaea-related infections.
TI  - Biodiversity and composition of methanogenic populations in the rumen of cows fed alfalfa hay or triticale straw.
AB  - It is clear that methanogens are responsible for ruminal methane emissions, but quantitative information about the composition of the methanogenic community in the bovine rumen is still limited. The diversity and composition of rumen methanogens in cows fed either alfalfa hay or triticale straw were examined using a full-cycle rRNA approach. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization undertaken applying oligonucleotide probes designed here identified five major methanogenic populations or groups in these animals: the Methanobrevibacter TMS group (consisting of Methanobrevibacter thaueri, Methanobrevibacter millerae and Methanobrevibacter smithii), Methanbrevibacter ruminantium-, Methanosphaera stadtmanae-, Methanomicrobium mobile-, and Methanimicrococcus-related methanogens. The TMS- and M. ruminantium-related methanogens accounted for on average 46% and 41% of the total methanogenic cells in liquid (Liq) and solid (Sol) phases of the rumen contents, respectively. Other prominent methanogens in the Liq and Sol phases included members of M. stadtmanae (15% and 33%), M. mobile (17% and 12%), and Methanimicrococcus (23% and 9%). The relative abundances of these methanogens in the community varied among individual animals and across diets. No clear differences in community composition could be observed with dietary change using cloning techniques. This study extends the known biodiversity levels of the methanogenic communities in the rumen of cows.
TI  - Age-related prevalence of Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis in the human gut microbiome.
AB  - A 16S rDNA sequence-based investigation of methanogenic Archaea in the human stools found Methanobrevibacter smithii in 99.2% and Methanosphaera stadtmanae in 32.6%. The recently described Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis found by others to be representative of a new order of methanogenic Archaea was found in 4% of stool specimens. The prevalence of M. luminyensis significantly increased with age, contrary to M. smithii and M. stadtmanae.
TI  - Laboratory tools for detection of archaea in humans.
AB  - This work represents an update of knowledge regarding the detection methods for human microbiome-associated archaea. Despite the fact that, during the last three decades, only four methanoarchaeal species have been isolated from the human mucosa, including faeces, subgingival plaque, and vaginal mucosa (Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanobrevibacter oralis and, most recently, 'Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis'), molecular studies, including PCR and metagenomic analyses, have detected DNA sequences indicative of the presence of additional methanoarchaea, as well as non-methanogenic archaea, in the human intestinal tract. Opinion is divided on the roles (if any) of these organisms in human disease, and certainly the data are still unclear. Future research and recently reported data highlighting the antimicrobial susceptibility of the human methanoarchaea could help in the design of selective media to discover additional human mucosa-associated archaea and ascertain their role in human infections involving complex flora.
TI  - Effects of antimicrobial peptides on methanogenic archaea.
AB  - As members of the indigenous human microbiota found on several mucosal tissues, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae are exposed to the effects of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) secreted by these epithelia. Although antimicrobial and molecular effects of AMPs on bacteria are well described, data for archaea are not available yet. Besides, it is not clear whether AMPs affect them as the archaeal cell envelope differs profoundly in terms of chemical composition and structure from that of bacteria. The effects of different synthetic AMPs on growth of M. smithii, M. stadtmanae, and Methanosarcina mazei were tested using a microtiter plate assay adapted to their anaerobic growth requirements. All three tested methanoarchaea were highly sensitive against derivatives of human cathelicidin, of porcine lysin, and a synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptide (Lpep); however, sensitivities differed markedly among the methanoarchaeal strains. The potent AMP concentrations affecting growth were below 10 muM, whereas growth of Escherichia coli WBB01 was not affected at peptide concentrations up to 10 muM under the same anaerobic growth conditions. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the structural integrity of the methanoarchaeal cells is destroyed within 4 h after incubation with AMPs. The disruption of the cell envelope of M. smithii, M. stadtmanae, and M. mazei within a few minutes of exposure was verified by using LIVE/DEAD staining. Our results strongly suggest that the release of AMPs by eukaryotic epithelial cells is a potent defense mechanism targeting not only bacteria, but also methanoarchaea.
TI  - Molecular diversity of methanogens in fecal samples from captive Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii).
AB  - Methane emissions have been previously detected from orangutans, but characterization of the diversity of methanogens in this species has yet to be completed. This preliminary study identified methanogen producing microorganims, also called methanogens, present in the feces from a colony of captive Sumatran orangutans at the Perth Zoo. All animals were housed in the same enclosure and were fed primarily a frugivorous diet. Methanogens were detected using a 16S rRNA gene clone library. A total of 207 clones were examined, revealing 37 different methanogen 16S rRNA sequences, or phylotypes. Of these, 31 phylotypes represented by 170 clones had 96.4-100% sequence identity to Methanosphaera stadtmanae, four phylotypes (32 clones) had 95.1-100% sequence identity to Methanobrevibacter smithii, while two phylotypes (five clones) had 95.9-97.7% sequence identity to Methanobacterium beijingense. Overall, five possible new species were identified from the clone library. This represents the first report of Msp. stadtmanae, a methanol utilizer, as the most predominant methanogen in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. This is likely due to the increased availability of methanol from the highly frugivorous diet of the orangutans. Further studies are warranted to properly assess the effects of frugivorous diets on the methanogen population.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identification of Archaea: towards the universal identification of living organisms.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) identification of Archaea has been limited to some environmental extremophiles belonging to distant taxa. We developed a specific protocol for MALDI-TOF-MS identification of Archaea and applied it to seven environmental human-associated Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, and the recently described Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensi Archaea. After mechanical lyse, we observed a unique protein profile for each organisms comprising 7-24 peaks ranging from 3,015 to 10,632 Da with a high quality score of 7.38 +/- 1.26. Profiles were reproducible over successive experiments performed at 1, 2, and 3-week growth durations and unambiguously distinguished the Archaea from all of the 3,995 bacterial spectra in the Bruker database. After the incorporation of the determined profiles into a local database, archaeal isolates were blindly identified within 10 min with an identification score of 1.9-2.3. The MALDI-TOF-MS-based clustering of these archaeal organisms was consistent with their 16S rDNA sequence-based phylogeny. These data prove that MALDI-TOF-MS profiling could be used as a first-line technique for the identification of human Archaea. In complement to previous reports for animal cells, Bacteria and giant viruses, MALDI-TOF-MS therefore appears as a universal method for the identification of living unicellular and multicellular organisms.
TI  - Immunogenic properties of archaeal species found in bioaerosols.
AB  - The etiology of bioaerosol-related pulmonary diseases remains poorly understood.  Recently, archaea emerged as prominent airborne components of agricultural environments, but the consequences of airway exposure to archaea remain unknown. Since subcomponents of archaea can be immunogenic, we used a murine model to study the pulmonary immune responses to two archaeal species found in agricultural facilities: Methanobrevibacter smithii (MBS) and Methanosphaera stadtmanae (MSS). Mice were administered intranasally with 6.25, 25 or 100 microg of MBS or MSS, once daily, 3 days a week, for 3 weeks. MSS induced more severe histopathological alterations than MBS with perivascular accumulation of granulocytes, pronounced thickening of the alveolar septa, alveolar macrophages accumulation and increased perivascular mononucleated cell accumulation. Analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids revealed up to 3 times greater leukocyte accumulation with MSS compared to MBS. Instillation of 100 microg of MBS or MSS caused predominant accumulation of monocyte/macrophages (4.5x10(5) and 4.8x10(5) cells/ml respectively) followed by CD4(+) T cells (1.38x10(5) and 1.94x10(5) cells/ml respectively), B cells (0.73x10(5) and 1.28x10(5) cells/ml respectively), and CD8(+) T cells (0.20x10(5) and 0.31x10(5) cells/ml respectively) in the airways. Both archaeal species induced similar titers of antigen-specific IgGs in plasma. MSS but not MBS caused an accumulation of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lungs, which surprisingly, correlated inversely with the size of the inoculum. Stronger immunogenicity of MSS was confirmed by a 3 fold higher accumulation of myeloid dendritic cells in the airways, compared to MBS. Thus, the dose and species of archaea determine the magnitude and nature of the pulmonary immune response. This is the first report of an immunomodulatory role of archaeal species found in bioaerosols.
TI  - A 'universal' type II chaperonin PCR detection system for the investigation of Archaea in complex microbial communities.
AB  - Bacteria and Archaea are evolutionarily and biochemically distinct domains found  together in many environments. Robust 'universal' PCR primer sets targeting both the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the type I chaperonin gene have been established. However, 'universal' PCR primers for Archaea are currently limited to the 16S rRNA gene. We investigated the type II chaperonin (known as the thermosome, TF55, CCT or TCP-1) as a potential universal target (UT) for Archaea. Reproducible amplification of thermosome gene sequences from all major phyla tested was achieved through the application of a mixture or 'cocktail' of two forward and two reverse primers. Phylogenies based on the approximately 750-bp thermosome UT were congruent with 16S rRNA gene phylogenies while exhibiting longer branch lengths, improving resolution of closely related taxa. 'Universal' thermosome primers were applied to profiling the archaeal community of dairy cow rumen and results compared with profiles based on the 16S rRNA gene and methyl co-enzyme M reductase (methanogen-specific) gene. Clone libraries generated from each target gene, as well as a pyrosequencing profile of one thermosome rumen library, revealed that all three targets consistently detected Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter ruminantium and Methanosphaera stadtmanae as the dominant constituents; however, thermosome gene sequences were more diverse than either of the other targets providing a higher resolution description of the archaeal community. These findings demonstrate that a 'universal' thermosome PCR protocol is a powerful metagenomic tool for detecting and characterizing Archaea and archaeal communities.
TI  - The antimicrobial resistance pattern of cultured human methanogens reflects the unique phylogenetic position of archaea.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Methanogenic archaea are constant members of the human oral and digestive microbiota retrieved, in particular, from periodontitis lesions. The objective of the study was to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobials. METHODS: Using the macrodilution method in Hungate tubes with optical microscope observation combined with monitoring methane production, we determined the antibiotic resistance characteristics of eight methanogenic archaea. RESULTS: Methanobrevibacter smithii strains were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, ofloxacin, tetracycline and amphotericin B, with MICs >/= 100 mg/L; these strains were also highly resistant to vancomycin (MIC >/= 50 mg/L). They were moderately resistant to chloramphenicol (MIC </= 25 mg/L), and were susceptible to bacitracin (MIC </= 4 mg/L), metronidazole, ornidazole and squalamine (MIC </= 1 mg/L). The susceptibility of Methanosphaera stadtmanae was the same as M. smithii, except for chloramphenicol (MIC </= 4 mg/L), and Methanobrevibacter oralis yielded the same data as M. smithii, except for bacitracin (MIC </= 25 mg/L). The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of 'Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis', which was recently isolated from human faeces, was identical to that of M. smithii. CONCLUSIONS: Human methanogenic archaea are highly resistant to antibiotics, being susceptible only to molecules that are also effective against both bacteria and eukarya. Methanogenic archaea are good candidates to test for antimicrobial activity against members of this unique domain of life. Further studies to develop new molecules specifically targeting archaea as potential causes of infection are warranted.
TI  - Archaea as emerging organisms in complex human microbiomes.
AB  - In this work, we review the state of knowledge of Archaea associated with the human microbiome. These prokaryotes, initially discovered in extreme environments, were named Archaea because these environments were thought to be the most primitive on Earth. Further research revealed that this terminology is misleading because these organisms were later found in various non-extreme environments, including the human host. Further examination of the human microbiome has enabled the isolation of three archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter oralis, which are associated with oral, intestinal and vaginal mucosae in humans. Moreover, molecular studies including metagenomic analyses detected DNA sequences indicative of the presence of additional methanogenic and non-methanogenic Archaea in the human intestinal tract. All three culturable Archaea are strict anaerobes, although their potential role in human diseases remains to be established. Future research aims to detect and culture additional human mucosa-associated Archaea and to look for their presence in additional human tissues, to establish their role in human infections involving complex flora.
TI  - The discussion goes on: What is the role of Euryarchaeota in humans?
AB  - The human body (primarily the intestinal tract, the oral cavity, and the skin) harbours approximately 1,000 different bacterial species. However, the number of archaeal species known to colonize man seems to be confined to a handful of organisms within the class Euryarchaeota (including Methanobrevibacter smithii, M. oralis, and Methanosphaera stadtmanae). In contrast to this conspicuously low diversity of Archaea in humans their unique physiology in conjunction with the growing number of reports regarding their occurrence at sites of infection has made this issue an emerging field of study. While previous review articles in recent years have addressed the putative role of particularly methanogenic archaea for human health and disease, this paper compiles novel experimental data that have been reported since then. The aim of this paper is to inspire the scientific community of "Archaea experts" for those unique archaeal organisms that have successfully participated in the human-microbe coevolution.
TI  - Molecular evaluation of the human gut methanogenic archaeal microbiota reveals an age-associated increase of the diversity.
AB  - The methanogenic diversity of the human intestinal microbiota has long been viewed as composed of two Methanobacteriales: Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae. Recently, Mx-01, a new phylotype hypothesized to belong to a putative sixth methanogenic order, was recovered from human faeces. Here we examined the diversity and the distribution of methanogens among healthy people of three age groups by analysing mcrA and 16S rDNA clones. The mcrA analysis of approximately 1200 clones revealed that the usual Methanobacteriales were present without any significant difference among adults and elderly (respectively 60% and 80% of carriers, n = 40, P = 0.3). In addition, four new phylotypes that grouped with Mx-01 in the same monophyletic clade were recovered. These phylotypes were significantly more frequently detected in elderly people (40%, n = 20) than in adults (10%, n = 20, P = 0.065). In parallel, new 16S rDNA phylotypes affiliated near or within Thermoplasmatales were recovered. Altogether, these results indicate an age-related apparition of Mx-phylotypes, putatively methanogenic, which are formed of several species carrying a mcrA gene and that are not related to any of the five methanogenic orders. These species may be related to Thermoplasmatales or may cohabit with archaeal species related to Thermoplasmatales.
TI  - High prevalence of Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae detected in the human gut using an improved DNA detection protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The low and variable prevalence of Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae DNA in human stool contrasts with the paramount role of these methanogenic Archaea in digestion processes. We hypothesized that this contrast is a consequence of the inefficiencies of current protocols for archaeon DNA extraction. We developed a new protocol for the extraction and PCR-based detection of M. smithii and M. stadtmanae DNA in human stool. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stool specimens collected from 700 individuals were filtered, mechanically lysed twice, and incubated overnight with proteinase K prior to DNA extraction using a commercial DNA extraction kit. Total DNA was used as a template for quantitative real-time PCR targeting M. smithii and M. stadtmanae 16S rRNA and rpoB genes. Amplification of 16S rRNA and rpoB yielded positive detection of M. smithii in 95.7% and M. stadtmanae in 29.4% of specimens. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR products from 30 randomly selected specimens (15 for M. smithii and 15 for M. stadtmanae) yielded a sequence similarity of 99-100% using the reference M. smithii ATCC 35061 and M. stadtmanae DSM 3091 sequences. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to previous reports, these data indicate a high prevalence of the methanogens M. smithii and M. stadtmanae in the human gut, with the former being an almost ubiquitous inhabitant of the intestinal microbiome.
TI  - A putative new order of methanogenic Archaea inhabiting the human gut, as revealed by molecular analyses of the mcrA gene.
AB  - The diversity of methanogenic Archaea from the gut of 6 humans was investigated by targeting mcrA, a molecular metabolic marker of methanogenesis. Three operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were recovered from about 400 clones analyzed, two of which were attributed to the expected Methanobacteriales Methanobrevibacter smithii (4 volunteers) and Methanosphaera stadtmanae (1 volunteer). The third OTU (1 volunteer) corresponded to a distant phylotype that does not cluster with any of the five methanogenic orders. This result, also supported by 16S archaeal sequences retrieved from the same volunteer, strongly suggests there may be a sixth order and hence potential underestimation of the role of methanogens in gut physiology.
TI  - Volatilisation of metals and metalloids: an inherent feature of methanoarchaea?
AB  - As shown by recent studies, anaerobic members of Archaea and Bacteria are involved in processes that transform ionic species of metals and metalloids (arsenic, antimony, bismuth, selenium, tellurium and mercury) into volatile and mostly toxic derivatives (mainly methyl derivatives or hydrides). Since the fact that these transformations proceed in both environmental settings and in parts of the human body, we have to consider that these processes also interfere directly with human health. The diversity of the volatile derivatives produced and their emission rates were significantly higher in methanoarchaeal than in bacterial strains, which supports the pivotal role of methanoarchaea in transforming metals and metalloids (metal(loid)s) into their volatile derivatives. Compared with methanoarchaea, 14 anaerobic bacterial strains showed a significantly restricted spectrum of volatilised derivatives and mostly lower production rates of volatile bismuth and selenium derivatives. Since methanoarchaea isolated from the human gut (Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanobrevibacter smithii) showed a higher potential for metal(loid) derivatisation compared to bacterial gut isolates, we assume that methanoarchaea in the human gut are mainly responsible for the production of these volatile derivatives. The observation that trimethylbismuth ((CH(3))(3)Bi), the main volatile derivative of bismuth produced in human feces, inhibited growing cultures of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a representative member of the human physiological gut flora, suggests that these volatiles exert their toxic effects on human health not only by direct interaction with host cells but also by disturbing the physiological gut microflora.
TI  - Evidence of increased diversity of methanogenic archaea with plant extract supplementation.
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of selected essential oils on archaeal communities using the ovine rumen model. Forty weaned Canadian Arcott ewes, fed with barley-based diet, were allotted to one of three essential oil supplementation treatments or a control (10 ewes per treatment) for 13 weeks. The treatments were cinnamaldehyde, garlic oil, juniper berry oil, and a control with no additive. Rumen content was sampled after slaughter and grouped by treatment by combining subsamples from each animal. DNA was extracted from the pooled samples and analyzed for methanogenic archaea using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cloning, and sequencing. Our results suggest that the total copy number of archaeal 16S rRNA was not significantly affected by the treatments. The phylogenetic analysis indicated a trend toward an increased diversity of methanogenic archaea related to Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanobrevibacter smithii, and some uncultured groups with cinnamaldehyde, garlic, and juniper berry oil supplementation. The trends in the diversity of methanogenic archaea observed with the essential oil supplementation may have resulted from changes in associated protozoal species. Supplementation of ruminant diets with essential oils may alter the diversity of rumen methanogens without affecting the methanogenic capacity of the rumen.
TI  - Postinoculation protozoan establishment and association patterns of methanogenic  archaea in the ovine rumen.
AB  - Association patterns between archaea and rumen protozoa were evaluated by analyzing archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from ovine rumen inoculated with different protozoa. Five protozoan inoculation treatments, fauna free (negative control), holotrich and cellulolytic protozoa, Isotricha and Dasytricha spp., Entodinium spp., and total fauna (type A) were tested. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR, and phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the impact of the protozoan inoculants on the respective archaeal communities. Protozoan 18S ribosomal DNA clone libraries were also evaluated to monitor the protozoal population that was established by the inoculation. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that archaeal clones associated with the fauna-free, the Entodinium, and the type A inoculations clustered primarily with uncultured phylotypes. Polyplastron multivesiculatum was the predominant protozoan strain established by the holotrich and cellulolytic protozoan treatment, and this resulted predominantly in archaeal clones affiliated with uncultured and cultured methanogenic phylotypes (Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, and Methanobacterium bryantii). Furthermore, the Isotricha and Dasytricha inoculation treatment resulted primarily in archaeal clones affiliated with Methanobrevibacter smithii. This report provides the first assessment of the influence of protozoa on archaea within the rumen microbial community and provides evidence to suggest that different archaeal phylotypes associate with specific groups of protozoa. The observed patterns may be linked to the evolution of commensal and symbiotic relationships between archaea and protozoa in the ovine rumen environment. This report further underscores the prevalence and potential importance of a rather large group of uncultivated archaea in the ovine rumen, probably unrelated to known methanogens and undocumented in the bovine rumen.
TI  - Analysis of methanogen diversity in the rumen using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis: identification of uncultured methanogens.
AB  - A temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) method was developed to determine the diversity of methanogen populations in the rumen. Tests with amplicons from genomic DNA from 12 cultured methanogens showed single bands for all strains, with only two showing apparently comigrating bands. Fingerprints of methanogen populations were analyzed from DNA extracted from rumen contents from two cattle and four sheep grazing pasture. For one sheep, dilution cultures selective for methanogens were grown and the culturable methanogens in each successive dilution examined by TTGE. A total of 66 methanogen sequences were retrieved from bands in fingerprints and analyzed to reveal the presence of methanogens belonging to the Methanobacteriales, the Methanosarcinales, and to an uncultured archaeal lineage. Twenty-four sequences were most similar to Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, five to Methanobrevibacter smithii, four to Methanosphaera stadtmanae, and for three, the nearest match was Methanimicrococcus blatticola. The remaining 30 sequences did not cluster with sequences from cultured archaea, but when combined with published novel sequences from clone libraries formed a monophyletic lineage within the Euryarchaeota, which contained two previously unrecognized clusters. The TTGE bands from this lineage showed that the uncultured methanogens had significant population densities in each of the six rumen samples examined. In cultures of dilutions from one rumen sample, TTGE examination revealed these methanogens at a level of at least 10(5)g(-1). Band intensities from low-dilution cultures indicated that these methanogens were present at similar densities to Methanobrevibacter ruminantium-like methanogens, the sole culturable methanogens in high dilutions (10(6)-10(-10) g(-1)). It is suggested that the uncultured methanogens together with Methanobrevibacter spp. may be the predominant methanogens in the rumen. The TTGE method presented in this article provides a new opportunity for characterizing methanogen populations in the rumen microbial ecosystem.
TI  - 16S rDNA directed PCR primers and detection of methanogens in the bovine rumen.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the diversity of ruminal methanogens in a grazing cow, and develop PCR primers targeting the predominant methanogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was extracted from rumen contents collected from a cow grazing pasture. Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR using two pairs of archaea-specific primers, and clone libraries prepared. Selected clones were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that for one primer pair, most sequences clustered with Methanobrevibacter spp. whereas with the other primer pair most clustered with Methanosphaera stadtmanae. One sequence belonged to the Crenarcheota. PCR primers were designed to detect Msp. stadtmanae and differentiate between Mbb. ruminantium and Mbb. smithii and successfully tested. CONCLUSIONS: The ruminal methanogens included Mbb. ruminantium, Mbb. smithii, Mbb. thaueri and methanogens similar to Msp.stadtmanae. The study showed that apparent methanogen diversity can be affected by selectivity from the archaea-specific primers used to create clone libraries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed a greater diversity of ruminal methanogens in grazing cows than previously recognized. It also shows the need for care in interpreting methanogen diversity using PCR-based analyses. The new PCR primers will enable more information to be obtained on Msp. stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter spp. in the rumen.
TI  - A structural comparison of the total polar lipids from the human archaea Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae and its relevance to the adjuvant activities of their liposomes.
AB  - Mice were immunized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) entrapped within archaeosomes (i.e. liposomes) composed of the total polar lipids (TPL) from the two methanogenic archaea common to the human digestive tract. Methanobrevibacter smithii archaeosomes boosted serum anti-BSA antibody to titers comparable to those achieved with Freund's adjuvant, whereas Methanosphaera stadtmanae archaeosomes were relatively poor adjuvants. An explanation for this difference was sought by analysis of the polar lipid composition of each archaeobacterium. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and NMR analyses of the purified lipids revealed a remarkable similarity in the ether lipid structures present in each TPL extract. However, the relative amounts of each lipid species varied dramatically. The phospholipid fraction in M. stadtmanae TPL was dominated by archaetidylinositol (50 mol% of TPL) and the glycolipid fraction by beta-Glcp-(1,6)-beta-Glcp-(1,1)-archaeol (36 mol%), whereas in M. smithii extracts, both caldarchaeol and archaeol lipids containing a phosphoserine head group were relatively abundant. Liposomes prepared from purified archaetidylinositol and from M. stadtmanae TPL supplemented with increasing amounts of phosphatidylserine elicited poor humoral responses to encapsulated BSA. A dramatic loss in the adjuvanticity of M. smithii archaeosomes was seen upon incorporation of 36 mol% of the uncharged lipid diglucosyl archaeol and, to a lesser extent, of 50 mol% of archaetidylinositol. Interestingly, the relative rates of uptake of M. smithii and M. stadtmanae archaeosomes by phagocytic cultures in vitro were similar. Thus, the lipid composition may influence archaeosome adjuvanticity, particularly a high diglucosyl archaeol and/or archaetidyl inositol content, resulting in a low adjuvant activity.
TI  - Methanogenic bacteria from human dental plaque.
AB  - Samples of human dental plaque were examined for the presence of methanogenic bacteria. Of 54 samples from 36 patients, 20 yielded H2/CO2-using methanogenic enrichment cultures. All methanogen-positive samples were from patients with some degree of periodontal disease. The predominant populations in the enrichments had morphologies characteristic of Methanobrevibacter spp. In six enrichments derived from three patients, the common methanogen was antigenically similar to Methanobrevibacter smithii. The same was true for the three methanogenic isolates obtained in axenic culture from a fourth patient. The six enrichments and two of the three isolates were antigenically closer to strain ALI than to PS. Two of the enrichments also had subpopulations with weak antigenic similarity to Methanosphaera stadtmanae. The data indicate that methanogens in the oral cavity of humans are antigenically close to those found in the intestinal tract.
