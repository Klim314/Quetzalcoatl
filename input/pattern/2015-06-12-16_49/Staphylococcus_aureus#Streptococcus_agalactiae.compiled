TI  - A Comparison of In-House Real-Time LAMP Assays with a Commercial Assay for the Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria.
AB  - Molecular detection of bacterial pathogens based on LAMP methods is a faster and  simpler approach than conventional culture methods. Although different LAMP-based methods for pathogenic bacterial detection are available, a systematic comparison of these different LAMP assays has not been performed. In this paper, we compared 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays with a commercialized kit (Isothermal Master Mix) for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157, E. coli O26, E. coli O45, E. coli O103, E. coli O111, E. coli O121, E. coli O145 and Streptococcus agalactiae. False-positive results were observed in all 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays, while all the negative controls of Isothermal Master Mix remained negative after amplification. The detection limit of Isothermal Master Mix for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157, E. coli O26, E. coli O45, E. coli O103, E. coli O111, E. coli O121 and Streptococcus agalactiae was 1 pg, whereas the sensitivity of the commercialized kit for E. coli O145 was 100 pg. In conclusion, the 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays were impractical to use, while the commercialized kit Isothermal Master Mix was useful for the detection of most bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Selecting anti-microbial treatment of aerobic vaginitis.
AB  - Aerobic vaginitis (AV) is a vaginal infectious condition which is often confused  with bacterial vaginosis (BV) or with the intermediate microflora as diagnosed by Nugent's method to detect BV on Gram-stained specimens. However, although both conditions reflect a state of lactobacillary disruption in the vagina, leading to an increase in pH, BV and AV differ profoundly. While BV is a noninflammatory condition composed of a multiplex array of different anaerobic bacteria in high quantities, AV is rather sparely populated by one or two enteric commensal flora bacteria, like Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylocuccus aureus, or Escherichia coli. AV is typically marked by either an increased inflammatory response or by prominent signs of epithelial atrophy or both. The latter condition, if severe, is also called desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. As AV is per exclusionem diagnosed by wet mount microscopy, it is a mistake to treat just vaginal culture results. Vaginal cultures only serve as follow-up data in clinical research projects and are at most used in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis or exclude Candida infection. AV requires treatment based on microscopy findings and a combined local treatment with any of the following which may yield the best results: antibiotic (infectious component), steroids (inflammatory component), and/or estrogen (atrophy component). In cases with Candida present on microscopy or culture, antifungals must be tried first in order to see if other treatment is still needed. Vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide rapid relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Local antibiotics most suitable are preferably non-absorbed and broad spectrum, especially those covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, like kanamycin. To achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms, oral therapy with amoxyclav or moxifloxacin can be used, especially in deep dermal vulvitis and colpitis infections with group B streptococci or (methicillin resistant) Staphylococcus aureus. Since the latter colonizations are frequent, but seldom inflammatory infections, we in general discourage the use of oral antibiotics in women with AV. In cases with a severe atrophy component (more than 10 % of epithelial cells are of the parabasal type), local estrogens can be used; and in postmenopausal or breast cancer patients with a contraindication for estrogens, even a combination of probiotics with an ultra-low dose of local estriol may be considered.
TI  - A C-type lectin from Bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts Staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. Staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. Several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of Bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against S. aureus NRS155. Crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against S. aureus. Biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. Two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were also assayed against S. epidermidis NRS101. Fraction 15 was identified by TripleTOF mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding C-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kDa. The lectin was purified from the crude venom by D-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. This pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of S. aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. The lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. The antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. A pre-formed S. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the C-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. chromogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Escherichia coli. These findings reveal a new activity for C-type lectins. Studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.
TI  - Effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by animal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance toward quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) is widespread  among a diverse range of microorganisms and is facilitated by several mechanisms such as biofilm formation. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by some field isolates of animal bacterial pathogens were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella serotypes, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (10 isolates of each) were examined for effects of benzalkonium chloride on biofilm formation and planktonic growth using microtiter plates. For all the examined strains in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of disinfectant. RESULTS: The means of strains growth increase after the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) were significant in all the bacteria (except for E. coli in 1/32 and S. agalactiae in of 1/8 MIC). Biofilm formation increased with decrease of antiseptics concentration; a significant increase was found in all the samples. The most turbidity related to S. aureus and the least to Salmonella. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance against quaternary ammonium compounds is increasing which can increase the bacterial biofilm formation.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. A total of 33,688 Staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (VGS), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) were included in this cross-susceptibility (DAL versus vancomycin [VAN]) analysis as well as 4576 coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). Isolates were collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program for the United States (USA) and Europe (2011-2013). Susceptibility testing followed CLSI (M07-A9 and M100-S24) methods. USA Food and Drug Administration (DAL) and CLSI (VAN) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between DAL and VAN susceptibility results. A categorical agreement (CA; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between DAL and VAN when testing S. aureus. Only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against VAN-susceptible isolates that displayed a DAL-nonsusceptible (MIC, 0.25 or 0.5mug/mL) phenotype. When susceptible MIC correlations were analyzed against indicated BHS species (Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes), an overall CA rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. Complete (100.0%) CA was documented for S. pyogenes, as well as against all VGS isolates, including the indicated Streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). In conclusion, high susceptible CA rates between DAL and VAN were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in ABSSSI. VAN-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by DAL (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/mL.
TI  - Reduction of Lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. The mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (SCC). Although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk SCC, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, Lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and SCC have not been determined previously. Thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. The overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. The Lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative PCR. Mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. Based on comparison with the pairwise Mann-Whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (P=0.0175), but lower E. coli (P=0.0002), S. aureus (P<0.0001), S. agalactiae (P=0.0001) and T. pyogenes (P=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. The negative correlation between Lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the SCC, was confirmed with Spearman correlation analysis. Data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between Lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.
TI  - Microbiology of Pelvic Lymphocyst Infection after Lymphadenectomy for Malignant Gynecologic Tumors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. Although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. The purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between October 2002 and March 2013. The participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. Computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. RESULTS: During the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors, and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. Cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus (three patients), S. epidermidis (one patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), Enterococcus (two patients), Escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). They were all monomicrobial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and other smaller ones suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. These bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein and Peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in the neonatal period. STUDY DESIGN: Breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. Concentrations of lactoferrin, LL-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of AMPs. Samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent LOS were compared for levels of AMPs and inhibition of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Levels of most AMPs and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. Lactoferrin was the only AMP that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. Levels of AMPs were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without LOS, however, infants who developed LOS consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk AMPs than those who were free from LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of lactoferrin and defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.
TI  - Heart transplantation as salvage treatment of intractable infective endocarditis.
AB  - This study reports six consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation as salvage treatment for endocarditis (Duke criteria) with extensive perivalvular lesions and end-stage heart failure. The median age was 45 years (range, 24 to 64), and the aortic valve was affected in all patients. Pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1), or not documented (n = 1). All patients survived, with no relapse, after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. The 10 patients with heart transplantation for endocarditis previously reported also survived (median follow-up, 27.5 months). Heart transplantation may be considered as salvage treatment in selected patients with intractable infective endocarditis.
TI  - Update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of Gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - A revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Telavancin activity was assessed against Gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. A total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the Telavancin International Surveillance Program for the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/mL, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/mL (revised FDA breakpoint). Telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All 692 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/mL) at </=0.25 mug/mL (FDA breakpoint), except for 1 strain (MIC, 0.5 mug/mL). All Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis with telavancin MIC values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/mL, respectively, had a VanA phenotype. A comparison data analysis based on the MIC90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Streptococci showed telavancin MIC50 values of </=0.015 mug/mL, except for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50, 0.03 mug/mL). These in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Effects of cathode design parameters on in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of electrically-activated silver-based iontophoretic system.
AB  - Post-operative infection is a major risk associated with implantable devices. Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ionic silver as an alternative to antibiotic-based infection prophylaxis and treatment. The focus of this study is on an electrically activated implant system engineered for active release of antimicrobial silver ions. The objective was to evaluate the effects of the cathode design, especially the cathode material, on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the system. A modified Kirby-Bauer diffusion technique was used for the antimicrobial efficacy evaluations (24 h testing interval). In phase-1 of the study, a three-way ANOVA (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was performed to determine the effects of cathode material (silver, titanium, and stainless steel), cathode surface area and electrode separation distance on the efficacy of the system against Staphylococcus aureus. The results show that within the design space tested, none of these parameters had a statistically significant effect on the antimicrobiality of the system (P > 0.15). Subsequently, one-way ANOVA (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was conducted in phase-2 to validate the inference regarding the non-significance of the cathode material to the system efficacy using a broader spectrum of pathogens (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Aspergillus flavus) responsible for osteomyelitis. The results confirmed the lack of statistical difference between efficacies of the three cathode material configurations against all pathogens tested (P > 0.58). Overall, the results demonstrate the ability to alter the cathode material and related design parameters in order to minimize the silver usage in the system without adversely affecting its antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - Inducible expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta and Toll-like receptor 2 promoters in goat mammary epithelial cells in response to bacterial challenges.
AB  - The development of a bacteria-inducible expression system has several advantages  compared with persistent expression of anti-bacterial proteins in milk to prevent and treat mastitis. The present study determined whether mastitis responsive promoters could regulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) in response to challenges with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. The level of expression of interleukin (IL)-1alpha was significantly increased in GMECs challenged with E. coli, S. aureus or S. agalactiae compared with untreated GMECs. IL-1beta was induced by E. coli and S. aureus, while Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was induced by E. coli only. GMECs were transfected with IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TLR2 promoter-EGFP reporter gene lentiviral expression vectors and the levels of expression of EGFP were measured by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis after bacterial challenge. EGFP expression driven by the IL-1alpha and IL-1beta promoters was higher in GMECs challenged with E. coli, S. aureus or S. agalactiae than in untreated GMECs. There were no differences in EGFP expression driven by the TLR2 promoter between GMECs challenged with S. aureus or S. agalactiae and untreated GMECs, but EGFP expression was significantly increased in GMECs challenged with E. coli. Overall, these results indicate that the promoters of some bacteria-inducible genes can regulate EGFP expression in GMECs in response to bacterial challenges. This bacteria-inducible expression strategy could be used for production of mastitis resistant animals by regulating the expression of anti-bacterial proteins in the mammary gland.
TI  - Influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  - Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases, to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. The performance of RPA with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in DNA sequences on RPA amplification reaction is not well understood. We investigated the specificity of RPA by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the cfb gene sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on RPA efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, S. agalactiae, P. aeruginosa, and M. tuberculosis as well as Bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. A total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. We observed that target specific RPA primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered RPA reaction. In addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected RPA yield. We demonstrated that the specificity of RPA was multifactorial. Therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. We recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. It is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.
TI  - Outcome of patients over 80 years of age on prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy for at least 6 months for prosthetic joint infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe elderly patients treated with prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy for a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in cases where the infected prosthesis could not be removed. METHODS: All patients aged >/=80 years with a documented PJI and treated with prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy for more than 6 months were included retrospectively in this study. The following events were noted: failure including persisting infection, relapse, new infection, treatment discontinuation due to severe adverse events, and related death, and also unrelated death. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with a median age of 84 years (80-95 years) were included; there were 24 hip infections, 13 knee infections, and one shoulder infection. The main causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (39%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (16%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics as prolonged suppressive therapy were penicillins. The median follow-up duration was 24 months; 60% of the patients were event-free at 24 months and were still on prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy. Fifteen events (six failures and nine unrelated deaths) were observed. Hypoalbuminaemia, the presence of a sinus tract, and a staphylococcal PJI were associated with an increased risk of an event. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy is an alternative therapy in elderly patients with PJI when surgery is contraindicated and when the bacteria are susceptible to well-tolerated oral antimicrobial therapy such as beta-lactams.
TI  - Antibacterial compounds from Salvia adenophora Fernald (Lamiaceae).
AB  - From the aerial parts of Salvia adenophora Fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. Compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. The structures were established by extensive 1D, 2D NMR and HRESI-TOFMS spectroscopic methods. Finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ECD spectra. Despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on Gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, Staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against S. epidermidis. Interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. No action was reported on Gram-negative strains nor on Candida albicans. These results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Molecular and bacteriological investigation of subclinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in domestic bovids from Ismailia, Egypt.
AB  - A study was carried out to establish the prevalence of subclinical mastitis (SCM) in smallholder dairy farms in Ismailia, Egypt. A total of 340 milking cows and buffaloes were sampled from 60 farms, and 50 nasal swabs were collected from consenting farm workers. Milk samples were subjected to California mastitis test (CMT) and the positive samples were examined by bacterial culture and PCR to identify etiological agents. Based on CMT, the prevalence of SCM was 71.6 % in cattle and 43.5 % in buffaloes while the prevalence was 25.2 % at cow-quarter level and 21.7 % at buffaloes-quarter level. Bacteriological analysis showed that the most frequently identified bacteria were Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (38.3 %) and Streptococcus (Str.) agalactiae (20 %). The diagnostic sensitivity of PCR compared to bacterial culture was superior with S. aureus and Str. agalactiae detection being 41 and 22.6 %, respectively. Furthermore, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains occurred in 52.2 and 45 % of isolates of animals and workers, respectively. Subclinical mastitis due to S. aureus and Str. agalactiae is endemic in smallholder dairy herds in Ismailia. The occurrence of MRSA in animals and workers highlights a need for wide epidemiological studies of MRSA and adopting control strategies.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Baseline activity of telavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in U.S. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher MIC values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). Streptococci showed telavancin modal MIC results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against Streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). This study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the United States (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive pathogens isolated in Canadian hospital laboratories from 2011 to 2013.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens isolated in 15 Canadian hospital laboratories between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility to oritavancin and comparative antimicrobial agents using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Oritavancin demonstrated in vitro activity equivalent to, or more potent than, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against the isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=1460; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.7% oritavancin-susceptible), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n=427; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.5% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=132; oritavancin MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL; 99.2% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=156; oritavancin MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL; 100% oritavancin-susceptible), and Enterococcus faecalis (n=304; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 98.7% oritavancin-susceptible) tested.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of recombinant Siganus oramin L-amino acid oxidase expressed in Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Siganus oraminl-amino acid oxidase is a novel natural protein (named SR-LAAO) isolated from serum of the rabbitfish (S. oramin), which showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and had a lethal effect on the parasites Cryptocaryon irritans, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. In order to test whether recombinant SR-LAAO (rSR-LAAO) produced by the eukaryotic expression system also has antimicrobial activity, the yeast Pichia pastoris was used as the expression host to obtain rSR-LAAO in vitro. Crude rSR-LAAO produced by P. pastoris integrated with the SR-LAAO gene had antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as shown by inhibition zone assay of the antibacterial spectrum on agar plates. The average diameter of the inhibition zone of crude rSR-LAAO against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was 1.040 +/- 0.045 cm and 1.209 +/- 0.085 cm, respectively. For the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sobria, Escherichia coli, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio cholera and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, the average diameter of inhibition zone was 1.291 +/- 0.089 cm, 0.943 +/- 0.061 cm, 0.756 +/- 0.057 cm, 0.834 +/- 0.023 cm and 1.211 +/- 0.026 cm, respectively. These results were obtained at the logarithmic growth phase of S. agalactiae and A. sobria cell suspensions after incubation with 0.5 mg/mL crude rSR-LAAO for 24 h. The final bacterial growth rate was decreased significantly. The relative inhibition rate can reach 50% compared to crude products from P. pastoris integrated with an empty vector at the same concentration of protein. The antimicrobial activity of crude rSR-LAAO was likely associated with H2O2 formation, because its inhibition zones were disturbed significantly by catalase. Scanning electron microscopy results showed crude rSR-LAAO-treated bacterial surfaces became rough and particles were attached, cell walls were retracted and cell membranes were ruptured. Together, the results of this study indicated rSR-LAAO from the P. pastoris expression system is a potential antibiotic for application as a therapeutic agent against bacterial diseases.
TI  - Plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  - Autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. The rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. In addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. In this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. The antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. Results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus oralis and Staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. The findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  - The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of </=10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants.
TI  - [Species and quantitative characteristics of pharyngeal mucosa microflora in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Species and quantitative characteristics of upper respiratory tract (URT) mucosa microflora in women at gestation period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of a bacteriological study of 68 samples of mucus from posterior pharyngeal wall in women at gestation period (from 14 weeks), 52 of those--from pregnant women with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and 16--from women without signs of disease, are presented. Qualitative and quantitative composition of microflora was studied by a generally accepted bacteriological method. RESULTS: During primary bacteriological study 111 microorganism cultures were isolated. 88 (79.3%) of strains belonged to Gram-positive flora, 20 (18.0%)--to Gram-negative, and Candida genus fungi constituted 3 (2.7%) isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from pregnant women with ARI signs at 23.1% and 5.8% frequency of occurrence, respectively. A higher detectability of Staphylococcus aureus--in 31.3% and Candida spp.--in 6.3% of women who did not complain as opposed to patients with URT lesions (in 21.2 and 3.9%, respectively) was determined. In patients without ARI signs the amount of bacteria did not exceed 10(5)--10(6) CFU/ml, in pregnant women with ARI diagnosis in 8 of 52 cases semination of pharyngeal mucuswas observed--10(7)--10(8) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans in composition of pharyngeal mucus microflora of pregnant women both with URT lesion signs and without them was shown, however the degree of semination by pathogens in the groups was different that determined the severity of disease manifestations.
TI  - Subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. A small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. This review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. Understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.
TI  - Short communication: comparing real-time PCR and bacteriological cultures for Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus in bulk-tank milk samples.
AB  - For more than 30 yr, a control plan for Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus has been carried out in more than 1,500 dairy herds of the province of Brescia (northern Italy). From 2010 to 2011, the apparent prevalence of Strep. agalactiae has been relatively stable around 10%, but the apparent prevalence of Staph. aureus has been greater than 40% with an increasing trend. The aim of this paper was to estimate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of 3 assays for the detection of Strep. agalactiae and Staph. aureus in bulk-tank milk samples (BTMS) in field conditions. The assays were a qualitative and a quantitative bacteriological culture (BC) for each pathogen and a homemade multiplex real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Because a gold standard was not available, the sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were evaluated using a Bayesian latent class approach. In 2012 we collected one BTMS from 165 dairy herds that were found positive for Strep. agalactiae in the previous 2-yr campaigns of eradication plan. In most cases, BTMS collected in these herds were positive for Staph. aureus as well, confirming the wide spread of this pathogen. At the same time we also collected composite milk samples from all the 8,624 lactating cows to evaluate the within-herd prevalence of Strep. agalactiae. Streptococcus agalactiae samples were cultured using a selective medium Tallium Kristalviolette Tossin, whereas for Staph. aureus, we used Baird Parker modified medium with added Rabbit Plasma Fibrinogen ISO-Formulation. In parallel, BTMS were tested using the rt-PCR. Regarding Strep. agalactiae, the posterior median of Se and Sp of the 2 BC was similar [qualitative BC: Se=98%, posterior credible interval (95%PCI): 94-100%, and Sp=99%, 95%PCI: 96-100%; quantitative BC: Se=99%, 95%PCI: 96-100%, and Sp=99%, 95%PCI: 95-100%] and higher than those of the rt-PCR (at 40 cycle threshold, Se=92%, 95%PCI: 85-97%; Sp=94%, 95%PCI: 88-98%). Also in case of Staph. aureus, the posterior medians of BC were generally higher than those of rt-PCR. In fact, although the Se of BC was slightly lower (rt-PCR at 40 cycle threshold, median Se=99%, 95%PCI: 97-100%, and qualitative BC, median Se=94%, 95%PCI: 87-99%), the Sp was much higher (rt-PCR at 40 cycle threshold, median Sp=67%, 95%PCI: 38-97%; qualitative BC, median Sp=95%; 95%PCI: 76-100%). Our study confirms that BC and rt-PCR are reliable diagnostic tools to detect Strep. agalactiae and Staph. aureus, and rt-PCR results should be confirmed by BC carried out on BTMS and possibly on composite milk samples.
TI  - Electrospun DOXY-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) nanofiber mats: in vitro drug release and antibacterial properties investigation.
AB  - Electrospun DOXY-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) nanofiber mats (PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats) were prepared by the electrospinning technique and post-spinning sorption method at various doses: PAA/DOXY-h125, PAA/DOXY-h250, PAA/DOXY-h500, and PAA/DOXY-h1000. The morphology, drug content, release characteristics, and antibacterial activities of the PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats were investigated with scanning electron microscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and disc diffusion methodology. The PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats had a diameter range of 285-340 nm, and a smooth surface without beads. Adsorption isotherms of DOXY-h could be described well with the Freundlich model. The amounts of DOXY-h, after the post-spinning sorption process, in the PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats ranged between 27.57 and 101.71 mg/g. All of the PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats exhibited an initial burst release characteristic with cumulative releasing percentages between 37.14 and 45.97%, which followed the Fickian diffusion mechanism. Based on the antibacterial investigation, the tested gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, seemed to be more sensitive to PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats than the tested gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These PAA/DOXY-h nanofiber mats could be used as an antibacterial wound dressing.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Silver sucrose octasulfate (IASOS) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  - This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with a substituted thiadiazole moiety as potent drug-resistant bacteria inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thiadiazole moieties were  synthesized via acylation reactions under mild conditions. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by the agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. The majority of the tested compounds displayed moderate antibacterial activities. Importantly, the three compounds with amino or tertiary amine groups in their side chains, 11, 13b, and 15c, were the most active antibacterial agents. Docking experiments carried out on the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA proved that there is a reasonable direct correlation between the binding free energy (DeltaGb, kcal/mol) and the antibacterial activity. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 11 and 15c in rat were characterized by moderate clearance and oral bioavailability.
TI  - Chlorhexidine digluconate effects on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in some field isolates of animal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study chlorhexidine digluconate disinfectant effects on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in some bacterial field isolates from animals. OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated chlorhexidine digluconate effects on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in some field isolates of veterinary bacterial pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella serotypes, Staphylococcus. aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (10 isolates for each) were examined for chlorhexidine digluconate effects on biofilm formation and planktonic growth using microtiter plates. In all of the examined strains in the presence of chlorhexidine digluconate, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of the disinfectant. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the planktonic growth of different bacterial species at sub-MICs. But they were able to induce biofilm development of the E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and Str. agalactiae strains. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance against chlorhexidine is increasing. Sub-MIC doses of chlorhexidine digluconate can stimulate the formation of biofilm strains.
TI  - Mastitogenic bacteria isolated from dairy cows in Kenya and their antimicrobial sensitivity.
AB  - There is limited epidemiological knowledge on udder health in Kenyan dairy cattle that would aid in a pro-active approach towards mastitis prevention. The study objectives were: (1) to investigate the prevalence and distribution of clinical and subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Mukurwe-ini and Nakuru Districts, Kenya, and (2) to determine the antibacterial sensitivity of the organisms causing bovine mastitis in these districts. The study involved field-screening of milk samples from 241 dairy cows on 128 farms by use of the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and, if CMT-positive, followed by bacteriological culture of the major causative agents and their respective antibiotic sensitivity to eight commonly used antibiotics. All participating farms were visited twice during the study period. The results obtained during the first and second visits showed the prevalence of clinical mastitis to be very low: 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively; 56.0% and 65.0% of cows were CMT-positive on at least one quarter and 49.6% and 58.7% of cows were culture-positive, respectively. There was no significant difference in mastitis prevalence between Nakuru and Mukurwe-ini districts (p &gt; 0.10). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 68.0% and 77.0% of samples during the first and second visits, respectively. Other frequently isolated agents included Streptococcus agalactiae, and other Streptococcus spp., S. aureus and S. agalactiae were most sensitive to gentamycin and norfloxacin, and least sensitive to cotrimazole and ampicillin. Knowing the prevalence of mastitogenic organisms and their antibiotic sensitivities could improve treatment efficacy and cow longevity.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius for CAMP-test.
AB  - CAMP test reliably detects Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS); it is traditionally performed streaking the tested isolate perpendicularly to Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), provided that reference Sa strains (that produce beta-hemolysin) are used. In a zone of beta-hemolysin activity, in fact, GBS and Lm form typical arrow-shaped hemolytic areas. While Sa production of the toxin is strain-dependent, however, that of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (Sp), a pet-owner colonizer and an emerging human pathogen, is constitutive, then observed in all clinical isolates. Therefore, Sp may indeed represent a valid alternative to perform the assay.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Herd- and cow-level risk factors associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy farms from the High Plains of the northern Antioquia, Colombia.
AB  - Mastitis is the main disease entity affecting dairy farms in the Colombian High Plains of northern Antioquia, Colombia. However, no previous epidemiologic studies have determined the characteristics that increase the risk of infection in this region, where manual milking is still the prevailing system of milking. A 24-mo longitudinal study was designed to identify the predominant mastitis pathogens and important herd- and cow-level risk factors. Monthly visits were made to 37 commercial dairy farms to collect herd- and cow-level data and milk samples. Herd size varied from 6 to 136 cows (mean 37.0, median 29). Herd-level factors included type of milking system (manual or mechanical) and a range of management practices recommended by the National Mastitis Council (Madison, WI) to prevent mastitis. Individual cow-level risk factors included parity, stage of lactation, breed, udder hygiene, and lameness. A logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between herd- and cow-level risk factors with the presence of subclinical mastitis and infection caused by Streptococcus agalactiae at the quarter level. A quarter was considered to have subclinical mastitis if it had a positive California Mastitis Test and was subsequently confirmed to have a somatic cell count of >/=200,000 cells/mL. Any cow with one or more quarters with subclinical mastitis was considered to have subclinical mastitis at the cow level. Using 17,622 cow observations, the mean prevalence of subclinical mastitis at the cow level was 37.2% (95% confidence interval: 31.2, 43.3) for the first month and did not substantially change throughout the study. The predominant microorganisms isolated from quarters meeting the subclinical mastitis definition were contagious pathogens, including Strep. agalactiae (34.4%), Corynebacterium spp. (13.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8.0%). Significant variables associated with subclinical mastitis risk at the quarter level included being a purebred Holstein cow, higher parity, and increased months in milk. Variables that were protective for mastitis risk included being a crossbreed cow and adequate premilking udder hygiene. Significant variables associated with Strep. agalactiae infection were higher parity, increased months in milk, and manual milking. Variables that were protective were postmilking teat dipping and adequate cleaning of the udder. The results highlight the importance of hygiene practices in contagious mastitis control in manually milked herds.
TI  - Evaluation of the Minnesota Easy Culture System II Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate for identification of common mastitis pathogens in milk.
AB  - The objective of this study was to validate use of the Minnesota Easy Culture System II Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate (University of Minnesota Laboratory for Udder Health, St. Paul) to identify common mastitis pathogens in milk. A total of 283 quarter and composite milk samples submitted to the University of Minnesota Laboratory for Udder Health during the spring of 2010 were cultured simultaneously using 3 methods: standard laboratory culture (reference method) and the Minnesota Easy Culture System II Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate methods. Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate cultures were incubated for 18 to 24h and interpreted by 2 independent, untrained readers within 5h of each other. An experienced technician completed the standard laboratory culture. For each sample, all 3 study personnel recorded the culture result (yes/no) for each of the following diagnostic categories: no bacterial growth (NG), mixed (2 organisms), contaminated (3 or more organisms), gram-positive (GP), gram-negative (GN), Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and other. For each category, the prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values of a positive and negative test were calculated, and the agreement between readers and between each reader and the laboratory was assessed. Specificity, overall accuracy, and negative predictive values were generally high (>80%) for the Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate for each category. Sensitivity and positive predictive values were intermediate (>60%) or high (>80%) for the broad categories of NG, GP, GN, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and for Staph. aureus, but were generally lower (<60%) for other more specific categories. Similarly, interreader agreement (kappa value) was moderate to substantial (40-80%) for the broad categories of NG, GP, GN, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and for Staph. aureus and E. coli, but was lower for other categories. The Tri-Plate had a higher sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value for Streptococcus spp., and higher interreader agreement for some of the more specific categories. Our conclusion was that Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate results will be most reliable when used to classify infections in broad diagnostic categories such NG, GP, or GN. The Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate will have intermediate ability to identify infections as being caused by Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., or Staph. aureus.
TI  - Predischarge postpartum methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and group B streptococcus carriage at the individual and hospital levels.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to characterize the relationship between individual group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization and pre-discharge postpartum methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in United States women delivering at term. We also sought to examine the association between hospital GBS colonization prevalence and MRSA infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a representative sample of United States community hospitals. Hierarchical regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusted for patient age, race, expected payer, and prepregnancy diabetes and hospital teaching status, urbanicity, ownership, size, and geographic region. We used multiple imputation for missing covariate data. RESULTS: There were 3,136,595 deliveries and 462 cases of MRSA infection included in this study. The odds ratio for individual GBS colonization was 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 1.5). For a five-percent increase in the hospital prevalence of GBS colonization, the odds ratio was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.1 to 5.6). CONCLUSIONS: The odds ratio estimate for the association of hospital GBS prevalence with MRSA infection is too imprecise to make conclusions about its magnitude and direction. Barring major bias in our estimates, individual GBS carriage does not appear to be strongly associated with predischarge postpartum MRSA infection.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.
TI  - Efficacy of on-farm use of ultraviolet light for inactivation of bacteria in milk for calves.
AB  - Ultraviolet light is being employed for bacterial inactivation in milk for calves; however, limited evidence is available to support the claim that UV light effectively inactivates bacteria found in milk. Thus, the objective of this observational study was to investigate the efficacy of on-farm UV light treatment in reducing bacteria populations in waste milk used for feeding calves. Samples of nonsaleable milk were collected from 9 Pennsylvania herds, twice daily for 15 d, both before and after UV light treatment (n=60 samples per farm), and analyzed for standard plate count, coliforms, noncoliform, gram-negative bacteria, environmental and contagious streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus count, and total solids percentage, and log reduction and percentage log reduction were calculated. Data were analyzed using the mixed procedure in SAS. In all bacteria types, samples collected after UV treatment contained significantly fewer bacteria compared with samples collected before UV treatment. Weighted least squares means for log reduction (percentage log reduction) were 1.34 (29%), 1.27 (58%), 1.48 (53%), 1.85 (55%), 1.37 (72%), 1.92 (63%), 1.07 (33%), and 1.67 (82%) for standard plate count, coliforms, noncoliform, gram-negative bacteria, environmental and contagious streptococci, Strep. agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Staph. aureus, respectively. A percentage log reduction greater than 50% was achieved in 6 of 8 bacteria types, and 43 and 94% of samples collected after UV treatment met recommended bacterial standards for milk for feeding calves. Based on these results, UV light treatment may be effective for some, but not all bacteria types found in nonsaleable waste milk. Thus, farmers should take into account the bacteria types that may need to be reduced when considering the purchase of a UV-treatment system.
TI  - Investigation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Bacillus licheniformis Strains Isolated from Retail Powdered Infant Milk Formulae.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten Bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Listeria innocua) and clinically relevant (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli) microorganisms. Deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all B. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive target organisms. PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the B. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. The remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. Further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 Da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. N-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 Da peptide from one strain identified it as ILPEITXIFHD. This peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by Bacillus spp. Subsequent PCR analyses demonstrated that the six B. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that the ~1,422 Da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.
TI  - Acute Neonatal Parotitis with Late-Onset Septic Shock due to Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Acute neonatal parotitis (ANP) is a very rare disease. Most cases are managed conservatively; early antibiotics and adequate hydration may reduce the need for surgery. The most common cause of ANP is Staphylococcus aureus. We report a rare case of acute neonatal parotitis with late-onset septic shock due to Streptococcus agalactiae. The diagnosis was confirmed with ultrasound and isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae from blood culture. The patient was treated successfully with 10 days of intravenous antibiotics and supportive measures. Despite being rare, streptococcal ANP should be considered in the etiological diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic might prevent serious complications.
TI  - Prospective analysis of risk factors associated with group B streptococcal colonisation in neonates born at a tertiary care centre in India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial colonisation of neonates and the birth canal by group B streptococci (GBS) plays a significant role in the development of neonatal infections. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of GBS colonisation in neonates in the first 48 hours of life and to identify the risk factors associated with GBS colonisation. METHODS: To estimate GBS colonisation, a prospective cross-sectional analysis of 1050 neonates delivered at a tertiary care hospital in India was undertaken. Swabs were taken from the neonates' skin and/or mucus membranes of the external ear canal, anterior nares, umbilicus, throat and ano-rectal sites between 24 and 48 hours of age. Data regarding the various risk factors were collected on a predesigned performa. RESULTS: 338 (32.2%) of 1050 neonates had bacterial colonisation. Escherichia coli (25.9%), was the bacteria most commonly isolated, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.3%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CONS) (12.6%). The overall rate of GBS colonisation was 3.23%. Preterm birth, respiratory distress at birth, prolonged rupture of membranes (>==18 hrs), intrapartum antibiotics, underlying medical illness in the mother, prolonged labour, maternal fever and other obstetric complications were identified as significant risk factors associated with neonatal GBS colonisation (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Multi-centre and community-based studies in India are recommended to identify the true colonisation rates for GBS, and it is necessary to perform cultures from multiple body sites of neonates in order to obtain an accurate bacteriological evaluation.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates collected from complicated skin and skin structure infections and intra-abdominal infections in Africa and Middle East countries: TEST 2007-2012.
AB  - Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are problematic due to decreasing therapeutic options available against multidrug-resistant pathogens common among these types of infections. A total of 2245 isolates from African and the Middle Eastern (AfME) countries were collected to determine in vitro activity for tigecycline and comparators during 2007-2012 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation Surveillance Trial program. Tigecycline was launched in the AfME in 2007 and remains active against a wide range of targeted pathogens worldwide. Isolates were recovered from cSSSI (1990) and IAI (255) from 38 sites in 11 AfME countries. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common species from cSSSI (27.9%), and the methicillin-resistant S. aureus rate was 25%. Enterococcus spp. (7.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2.9%) were other common Gram-positive pathogens represented. Enterobacter spp. (14.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Escherichia coli (11.4%), Klebsiella spp. (10.9%), and Acinetobacter spp. (7.2 %) were the most common Gram-negative species collected. Tigecycline MIC(90) values were 0.25 mug/mL against S. aureus. E. coli and Enterobacter spp. had tigecycline MIC(90) values of 1 and 2 mug/mL, respectively. E. coli was the most frequently collected species from IAI (28.3%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (20.8%), Enterococcus spp. (11.8%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.3%). Isolates collected from IAI had the following tigecycline MIC(90) values: E. coli (1 mug/mL), Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae (2 mug/mL), Enterococcus spp. (0.25 mug/mL), and S. maltophilia (1 mug/mL). Tigecycline in vitro activity was observed against a broad spectrum of bacterial species, including strains resistant to other antimicrobial classes.
TI  - Evaluation of the effects of ultraviolet light on bacterial contaminants inoculated into whole milk and colostrum, and on colostrum immunoglobulin G.
AB  - Raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. According to the USDA, more than 58% of calves in the United States are fed unpasteurized milk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of UV light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum IgG. A pilot-scale UV light continuous (UVC) flow-through unit (45 J/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. Colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with Listeria innocua, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with UVC. During UVC treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. The effect of UVC on IgG was evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. For each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and IgG was measured using ELISA. The UVC treatment of milk resulted in a significant final count (log cfu/mL) reduction of Listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), Escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), Staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/mL reduction), and A. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/mL) reduction for M. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/mL) of Listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), and Acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), but not of E. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), and Staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the IgG concentration, with an observed final mean IgG reduction of approximately 50%. Development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to IgG caused by manipulating colostrum.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem.The focused update on infective endocarditis of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis as not recommended for urinary tract procedures in the absence of active infection. A statistical association has been recently shown between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Actinobaculum schaalii, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and new findings indicate there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (Lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal Lb strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans strains) were assayed. Also, associative cultures of Lb strains and S. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, pH, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were determined at different times. Based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed in mice with Lactobacillus gasseri CRL 1509 or Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with S. agalactiae. Results were analysed by ANOVA (repeated measures and general linear models). Most of the Lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of S. agalactiae strains. Only one strain (Lactobacillus reuteri CRL 1324) positively affected the aggregation of S. aureus and none increased the aggregation of C. albicans. The inhibition of the growth of S. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids by lactobacilli was evidenced. The Lb-S. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. Parallel increases in lactic acid and H2O2 levels were observed. However, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with Lb. In conclusion, vaginal Lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on S. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against S. agalactiae challenge. However, as these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of Lb against challenge with S. agalactiae.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Trends in bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal meningitis in England and Wales 2004-11: an observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meningitis remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, yet there are few population-based studies on the epidemiology, causes, or trends over time in meningitis, especially in industrialised countries. Our aim was to do such a study using routinely reported data available in England and Wales. METHODS: In England and Wales, UK National Health Service hospitals routinely report laboratory-confirmed pathogens electronically to Public Health England. Records of all positive bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal results from cerebrospinal fluid or from blood cultures in patients with clinical meningitis were extracted for analysis. The percentage change in annual incidence was estimated using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual incidence. FINDINGS: During 2004-11, 7061 cases of meningitis were reported (mean annual incidence 1.62 per 100,000 people, 95% CI 1.58-1.66), including 2594 cases in children (37%). The incidence of bacterial (1.44 per 100,000 people, 1.41-1.48), fungal (0.09, 0.08-0.10), and mycobacterial (0.09, 0.08-0.09) meningitis remained stable overall and across the age groups, apart from significant year-on-year increases in children younger than 3 months (978 cases; incidence 72.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 7.4%, 5.1-9.8; p<0.0001) driven mainly by group B streptococci (GBS), and in adults aged 65 years or older (752 cases; incidence 1.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 3.0%, 1.4-4.8; p<0.0001) primarily because of Escherichia coli. By contrast, meningococcal meningitis rates declined steadily, but remained the most common cause of meningitis in children. Overall, five groups of bacteria accounted for 60% (3790/6286) of bacterial meningitis cases: Neisseria meningitidis (1350 cases, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1143, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (652, 10%), GBS (326, 5%), and E coli (319, 5%). INTERPRETATION: In England and Wales, laboratory-based surveillance shows a remarkably stable incidence of bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial meningitis in recent years, although there were differences in individual trends among the main pathogens causing meningitis in different age groups. FUNDING: None.
TI  - Trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  - Mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. The etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. They may be either contagious viz. Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, Corynebacterium bovis and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus. Conventional diagnostic tests viz. California Mastitis Test (CMT); R-mastitest and Mast-O-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and Bulk Tank Somatic Cell Count (BTSCC) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. In vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. The advent of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time PCR has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. Circulating micro RNA (miRNA) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important condition. Improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; Improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. The use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (Terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. Vaccines viz. cell based; Recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type C mutant) or chimeric (pauA); live (S. uberis 0140J stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; DNA-based and DNA-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. Quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, interleukin (IL) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (CACNA2D1) are also indispensable. This mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.
TI  - Properties of an Arcanobacterium haemolyticum strain isolated from a donkey.
AB  - The present study was designed to characterize phenotypically and genotypically an Arcanobacterium haemolyticum strain (A. haemolyticum P646) isolated from a purulent nasal discharge of a donkey. A. haemolyticum P646 showed, compared to sheep blood, an enhanced hemolytic reaction on rabbit blood agar, a synergistic CAMP-like reaction with Streptococcus agalactiae and Rhodococcus equi as indicator strains, a reverse CAMP reaction in the zone of Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin and the typical biochemical properties of this species. The species identity could be confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, by sequencing the 16S rDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene gap and by amplification of A. haemolyticum specific parts of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region and 23S rDNA. A. haemolyticum P646 and the reference strain A. haemolyticum DSM 20595 were further characterized by amplification of the putative virulence genes encoding arcanolysin, phospholipase D, hemolysin A, CAMP factor family protein, a collagen binding protein and two neuraminidases which were present for A. haemolyticum DSM 20595. A. haemolyticum P646 showed a comparable gene spectrum but was negative for the genes encoding collagen binding protein and neuraminidase H. To our knowledge, the present study is the first phenotypic and genotypic characterization of an A. haemolyticum strain isolated from a donkey.
TI  - Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time PCR and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  - Diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by Mycoplasma bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two California dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. M. bovis was investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI=1.9, 3.7), whereas Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were studied in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% CI=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% CI=12.9, 20.7), respectively. Diagnostic strategies involved a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), or both. Strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. Culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. The reference strategy was the strategy with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both M. bovis and Strep. agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95% CI: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% CI: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. The reference strategy for Staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% CI: 88.3, 99.6). The most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. QPCR testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for M. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. A stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. In the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. However, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. Several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.
TI  - Effect of two probiotic strains of Lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - The lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. This microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. In this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. For these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes) were used. The lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 Lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of S. aureus, S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (P < 0.01). The lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. The aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal Lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety.
AB  - Novel pleuromutilin derivatives designed based on the structure of valnemulin were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. These pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety exhibited excellent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Compound 5b showed the highest antibacterial activities and even exceeded tiamulin. Moreover, the docking experiments provided information about the binding model between the synthesized compounds and peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA.
TI  - Intensive mutagenesis of the nisin hinge leads to the rational design of enhanced derivatives.
AB  - Nisin A is the most extensively studied lantibiotic and has been used as a preservative by the food industry since 1953. This 34 amino acid peptide contains three dehydrated amino acids and five thioether rings. These rings, resulting from one lanthionine and four methyllanthionine bridges, confer the peptide with its unique structure. Nisin A has two mechanisms of action, with the N-terminal domain of the peptide inhibiting cell wall synthesis through lipid II binding and the C-terminal domain responsible for pore-formation. The focus of this study is the three amino acid 'hinge' region (N 20, M 21 and K 22) which separates these two domains and allows for conformational flexibility. As all lantibiotics are gene encoded, novel variants can be generated through manipulation of the corresponding gene. A number of derivatives in which the hinge region was altered have previously been shown to possess enhanced antimicrobial activity. Here we take this approach further by employing simultaneous, indiscriminate site-saturation mutagenesis of all three hinge residues to create a novel bank of nisin derivative producers. Screening of this bank revealed that producers of peptides with hinge regions consisting of AAK, NAI and SLS displayed enhanced bioactivity against a variety of targets. These and other results suggested a preference for small, chiral amino acids within the hinge region, leading to the design and creation of producers of peptides with hinges consisting of AAA and SAA. These producers, and the corresponding peptides, exhibited enhanced bioactivity against Lactococcus lactis HP, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2155 and Staphylococcus aureus RF122 and thus represent the first example of nisin derivatives that possess enhanced activity as a consequence of rational design.

TI  - Bacteria detected after instrumentation surgery for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a canine model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. METHODS: Dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. The implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. Bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. The positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. RESULTS: Radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. However, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. CONCLUSION: Within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. The use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. The metallic implants may not be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.
TI  - Antibiotic use during pregnancy alters the commensal vaginal microbiota.
AB  - Antibiotics may induce alterations in the commensal microbiota of the birth canal in pregnant women. Therefore, we studied the effect of antibiotic administration during pregnancy on commensal vaginal bacterial colonization at gestational week 36. Six hundred and sixty-eight pregnant women from the novel unselected Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010 ) pregnancy cohort participated in this analysis. Detailed information on oral antibiotic prescriptions during pregnancy filled at the pharmacy was obtained and verified prospectively. Vaginal samples were obtained at pregnancy week 36 and cultured for bacteria. Women who received oral antibiotics during any pregnancy trimester had an increased rate of colonization by Staphylococcus species in the vaginal samples as compared with samples obtained from women without any antibiotic treatment during pregnancy (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.06-2.52, p 0.028). Oral antibiotic administration in the third trimester were also associated with increased colonization by Staphylococcus species (adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04-3.76, p 0.037). These bacteriological changes were associated with urinary tract infection antibiotics. Women treated in the third trimester of pregnancy were more often colonized by Escherichia coli than women without antibiotic treatment in the third trimester (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04-3.52, p 0.038). This change was associated with respiratory tract infection (RTI) antibiotics. We did not observe any significant changes in vaginal Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptoccocus) or Staphylococcus aureus colonization following antibiotic treatment in pregnancy. Antibiotic administration during pregnancy leads to alterations in the vaginal microbiological ecology prior to birth, with potential morbidity, and long-term effects on the early microbial colonization of the neonate.
TI  - In vitro characterization of PlySK1249, a novel phage lysin, and assessment of its antibacterial activity in a mouse model of Streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia.
AB  - Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of bacteremia and invasive infections. These diseases are treated with beta-lactams or macrolides, but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. New bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. They hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. By using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis SK1249. The gene product, named PlySK1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an N-terminal amidase and a C-terminal CHAP domain. Purified PlySK1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for S. dysgalactiae (2-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min). Moreover, it also efficiently killed S. agalactiae (1.5-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. We further investigated the activity of PlySK1249 in a mouse model of S. agalactiae bacteremia. Eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) CFU of S. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of PlySK1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (P < 0.01). Thus, PlySK1249, which was isolated from S. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against S. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. These encouraging results indicated that PlySK1249 might represent a good candidate to be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic S. agalactiae infections.
TI  - Septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint: an uncommon location.
AB  - Septic pyogenic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a rare entity that occurs in immunosuppressed patients or those with discontinuity of defense barriers. There are only 15 cases described in the literature. The diagnosis is based on clinical features and the isolation of a microorganism in synovial fluid or blood cultures. The evidence of arthritis by imaging (MRI, ultrasound or scintigraphy) may be useful. Antibiotic treatment is the same as in septic arthritis in other locations. Staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most frequently isolated. Our objective was to describe the clinical features, treatment and outcome of patients diagnosed with septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint at a Rheumatology Department. We developed a study with a retrospective design (1989-2012). The medical records of patients with septic arthritis were reviewed (101 patients). Those involving the acromioclavicular joint were selected (6 patients; 6%).
TI  - New non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  - Hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. World health organization (WHO) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. In this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. The new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (CS) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MR S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant S. epidermidis (MDR S. epidermidis), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and three clinical isolates: MR S. aureus, MDR S. epidermidis, and an E. coli strain. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices were evaluated. Ethanol 70% V/V, isopropanol 60% V/V, and 4% w/V chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. Copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: The MIC and MBC for CS ranged from 781 mg/l against S. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against E. coli strains and C. albicans. In addition, PCA exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. The combination of CS and PCA showed a strong synergistic effect and all FIC indices were </=0.500. The combination of CS and PCA were more effective than ethanol 70% V/V and isopropanol 60% V/V. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. This work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Maternal and neonatal colonization in Bangladesh: prevalences, etiologies and risk factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of maternal colonizers in South Asia and their potential to colonize the umbilicus, an important precondition causing neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study at a maternity center in Dhaka with 1219 pregnant women and a subset of 152 newborns from 15 January to 31 October 2011. During labor, study paramedics collected vaginal swabs for bacterial culture and rectal swabs for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) testing. Community health workers collected neonatal umbilical swabs. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios. RESULT: In all, 454 women (37.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 34.5 to 40.0%) were colonized. The most common organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Non-GBS and GBS. A total of 94 women (7.7%, 95% CI 6.2 to 9.2%) were colonized with GBS. The risk of GBS umbilical colonization was higher (RR=12.98, 95% CI 3.97 to 42.64) among newborns of mothers with GBS colonization. CONCLUSION: Newborns of mothers colonized with GBS are at higher risk of developing umbilical colonization.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Menaquinone analogs inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria cause serious human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. We initiated studies with four of these organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exotoxin production, focusing on menaquinone analogs. Menadione, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzymes Q1 to Q3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme Q10 inhibited the growth and to a greater extent exotoxin production of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 mug/ml. Coenzyme Q1 reduced the ability of S. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four Gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit S. aureus growth. The staphylococcal two-component system SrrA/B was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme Q1. We hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasma membranes and biosynthetic machinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, and macromolecular synthesis. These compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Improved protease stability of the antimicrobial peptide Pin2 substituted with D-amino acids.
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted a great interest as novel class of antibiotics that might help in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. However, some AMPs with high antimicrobial activities are also highly hemolytic and subject to proteolytic degradation from human and bacterial proteases that limit their pharmaceutical uses. In this work a D-diastereomer of Pandinin 2, D-Pin2, was constructed to observe if it maintained antimicrobial activity in the same range as the parental one, but with the purpose of reducing its hemolytic activity to human erythrocytes and improving its ability to resist proteolytic cleavage. Although, the hydrophobic and secondary structure characteristics of L- and D-Pin2 were to some extent similar, an important reduction in D-Pin2 hemolytic activity (30-40 %) was achieved compared to that of L-Pin2 over human erythrocytes. Furthermore, D-Pin2 had an antimicrobial activity with a MIC value of 12.5 muM towards Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in agar diffusion assays, but it was half less potent than that of L-Pin2. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of D-Pin2 was equally effective as that of L-Pin2 in microdilution assays. Yet, when D- and L-Pin2 were incubated with trypsin, elastase and whole human serum, only D-Pin2 kept its antimicrobial activity towards all bacteria, but in diluted human serum, L- and D-Pin2 maintained similar peptide stability. Finally, when L- and D-Pin2 were incubated with proteases from P. aeruginosa DFU3 culture, a clinical isolated strain, D-Pin2 kept its antibiotic activity while L-Pin2 was not effective.
TI  - Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents among bovine mastitis pathogens isolated from North American dairy cattle, 2002-2010.
AB  - Approximately 8,000 isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, isolated by 25 veterinary laboratories across North America between 2002 and 2010, were tested for in vitro susceptibility to beta-lactam, macrolide, and lincosamide drugs. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the beta-lactam drugs remained low against most of the Gram-positive strains tested, and no substantial changes in the MIC distributions were seen over time. Of the beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested, only ceftiofur showed good in vitro activity against E. coli. The MICs of the macrolides and lincosamides also remained low against Gram-positive mastitis pathogens. While the MIC values given by 50% of isolates (MIC50) for erythromycin and pirlimycin and the streptococci were all low (</=0.5 microg/ml), the MIC values given by 90% of isolates (MIC90) were higher and more variable, but with no apparent increase over time. Staphylococcus aureus showed little change in erythromycin susceptibility over time, but there may be a small, numerical increase in pirlimycin MIC50 and MIC90 values. Overall, the results suggest that mastitis pathogens in the United States and Canada have not shown any substantial changes in the in vitro susceptibility to beta-lactam, macrolide, and lincosamide drugs tested over the 9 years of the study.
TI  - [The pharmacodynamic research on fuxiye, a Chinese herbal lotion for external wash].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe antisepsis, anti-swelling, and therapeutic effects of Fuxiye (FXY), a Chinese medical lotion for external wash in treating vaginitis model rats. METHODS: The cervicitis rat model was induced by agar plate diffusion, ear auricle swelling induced by dimethylbenzene, and chemical stimulus. The in vitro antibiotic actions of FXY were observed. Besides, its effects on the swelling and inflammation in model rats were also observed. RESULTS: FXY at 25 mg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, pyogenic Streptococcus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. FXY at 50 mg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. It obviously restrained dimethylbenzene induced ear auricle swelling. It significantly alleviated cervicitis induced by chemical stiumli. CONCLUSION: FXY showed better effects on antisepsis, anti-inflammation, and treating cervicitis.
TI  - Streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  - The role of Streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is considered to be of little relevance. We aimed to describe a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (SVO), to analyze the clinical features associated with different Streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with VO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. An incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of SVO (1991-2011) were performed. Statistical comparison of SVO by different species and between them and staphylococcal VO was carried out. Over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of VOs and SVOs per year (p <0.05). Among 58 cases of SVO, those caused by non-viridans streptococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked VO by S. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). In contrast, the latter have a sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis (p <0.05). Among non-viridans SVOs, concomitant infection was specifically related to S. pneumoniae (p <0.05). In conclusion, SVO presents a wide range of clinical patterns. The relationship between VO and diagnosis of endocarditis was established with SVO caused by the viridans group. Whereas non-viridans SVO mimics acute characteristics of VO caused by S. aureus, cases of viridans SVO are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. The increased incidence of SVO during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of plant-derived diterpenes against bovine mastitis bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antibacterial activity of three diterpenes isolated from natural sources against a panel of microorganisms responsible for bovine mastitis. ent-Copalic acid (CA) was the most active metabolite, with promising MIC values (from 1.56 to 6.25 microg mL-1) against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC and clinical isolate), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. We conducted time-kill assays of CA against S. aureus, a commensal organism considered to be a ubiquitous etiological agent of bovine mastitis in dairy farms worldwide. In the first 12 h, CA only inhibited the growth of the inoculums (bacteriostatic effect), but its bactericidal effect was clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). In conclusion, CA should be considered for the control of several Gram-positive bacteria related to bovine mastitis.
TI  - Characterization of Tn5801.Sag, a variant of Staphylococcus aureus Tn916 family transposon Tn5801 that is widespread in clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Tn5801, originally detected in Staphylococcus aureus Mu50, is a Tn916 family element in which a unique int gene (int5801) replaces the int and xis genes in Tn916 (int916 and xis916). Among 62 tet(M)-positive tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 43 harbored Tn916, whereas 19 harbored a Tn5801-like element (Tn5801.Sag, approximately 20.6 kb). Tn5801.Sag was characterized (PCR mapping, partial sequencing, and chromosomal integration) and compared to other Tn5801-like elements. Similar to Tn5801 from S. aureus Mu50, tested in parallel, Tn5801.Sag was unable to undergo circularization and conjugal transfer.
TI  - Anti-bacterial activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 secreted in the milk of transgenic goats produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer.
AB  - The present study was conducted to determine whether recombinant human beta-defensin-3 (rHBD3) in the milk of transgenic goats has an anti-bacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) that could cause mastitis. A HBD3 mammary-specific expression vector was transfected by electroporation into goat fetal fibroblasts which were used to produce fourteen healthy transgenic goats by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The expression level of rHBD3 in the milk of the six transgenic goats ranged from 98 to 121 microg/ml at 15 days of lactation, and was maintained at 90-111 microg/ml during the following 2 months. Milk samples from transgenic goats showed an obvious inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. aureus and S. agalactiae in vitro. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of rHBD3 in milk against E. coli, S. aureus and S. agalactiae were 9.5-10.5, 21.8-23.0 and 17.3-18.5 microg/mL, respectively, which was similar to those of the HBD3 standard (P>0.05). The in vivo anti-bacterial activities of rHBD3 in milk were examined by intramammary infusion of viable bacterial inoculums. We observed that 9/10 and 8/10 glands of non-transgenic goats infused with S. aureus and E. coli became infected. The mean numbers of viable bacteria went up to 2.9x10(3) and 95.4x10(3) CFU/ml at 48 h after infusion, respectively; the mean somatic cell counts (SCC) in infected glands reached up to 260.4x10(5) and 622.2x10(5) cells/ml, which were significantly higher than the SCC in uninfected goat glands. In contrast, no bacteria was presented in glands of transgenic goats and PBS-infused controls, and the SSC did not significantly change throughout the period. Moreover, the compositions and protein profiles of milk from transgenic and non-transgenic goats were identical. The present study demonstrated that HBD3 were an effective anti-bacterial protein to enhance the mastitis resistance of dairy animals.
TI  - Comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  - The objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the Milk Analysis Laboratory (L.I.G.A.L.) at Galicia, Spain from June 2005 to September 2011. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as Cluster Analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. The decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in IMI caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. The obtained results reflect a greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional classification into contagious or environmental. Staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. Among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, Strep. uberis showed a different behavior to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species and Streptococcus other than Strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. Time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as Cluster Analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. Furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.
TI  - Performance of the Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry system for identification of Gram-positive cocci routinely isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  - We evaluated the performance of the Vitek MS for identification of Gram-positive  cocci routinely isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories. With a total of 424 well-characterized isolates, the results of the Vitek MS were compared to those of conventional methods and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The Vitek MS correctly identified 97.9 % of the isolates tested to species level. The Vitek MS correctly identified the species of 97.2 % of the staphylococci (95.9 % of coagulase-negative staphylococci), 97.8 % of the streptococci, and 100 % of the enterococci. For the identification of Gram-positive cocci isolates, the overall concordance rate between conventional identification and the Vitek MS was 94.5 %. The Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system can be a reliable and rapid method for the identification of most relevant Gram-positive cocci. In addition, expanding the database of the Vitek MS, especially for coagulase-negative staphylococci, is needed to enhance the performance of the Vitek MS.
TI  - Pathogen profile of clinical mastitis in Irish milk-recording herds reveals a complex aetiology.
AB  - Effective mastitis control requires knowledge of the predominant pathogen challenges on the farm. In order to quantify this challenge, the aetiological agents associated with clinical mastitis in 30 milk-recording dairy herds in Ireland over a complete lactation were investigated. Standard bacteriology was performed on 630 pretreatment quarter milk samples, of which 56 per cent were culture-positive, 42 per cent culture-negative and 2 per cent contaminated. Two micro-organisms were isolated from almost 5 per cent of the culture-positive samples. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23 per cent), Streptococcus uberis (17 per cent), Escherichia coli (9 per cent), Streptococcus species (6 per cent), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (4 per cent) and other species (1 per cent). A wide variety of bacterial species were associated with clinical mastitis, with S aureus the most prevalent pathogen overall, followed by S uberis. However, the bacterial challenges varied widely from farm to farm. In comparison with previous reports, in the present study, the contagious pathogens S aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae were less commonly associated with clinical mastitis, whereas, the environmental pathogens S uberis and E coli were found more commonly associated with clinical mastitis. While S aureus remains the pathogen most commonly associated with intramammary infection in these herds, environmental pathogens, such as S uberis and E coli also present a considerable challenge.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. In this study, we examine susceptibility among Gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. A total of 9,422 Gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from Europe and North America. One-third of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. All S. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). Ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (P < 0.0001 for both). Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in Africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in Asia-Pacific Rim (38%). Penicillin resistance occurred in one-fifth of all S. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in Africa to 65% in Europe. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P < 0.001). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in TEST 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending Saint Camille Medical Centre in Ouagadougou. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. Furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. RESULTS: The results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. Candida albicans (48.76%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.67%), Streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. However, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. Efforts should be made to address these points in the country.
TI  - Prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk in Quebec.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of mycoplasma, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae in bulk tank milk (BTM) in Quebec dairy herds. BTM was sampled 3 times a month in 117 randomly selected dairy herds. Samples were submitted for S. aureus, S. agalactiae, and mycoplasma and for direct mycoplasma detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mycoplasma spp. was identified at least once in 3 herds (2.6%) by primary culture and/or PCR and in 4 herds (3.4%) by enrichment culture and/or PCR. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated at least once in 99 (84.6%) and 112 (95.7%) herds in primary culture and after enrichment, respectively. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated at least once in 9 (7.7%) and 10 (8.6%) herds in primary culture and after enrichment, respectively. Herd prevalence of mycoplasma was similar to that previously reported in Canada. Staphylococcus aureus is still by far the most important contagious mastitis pathogen.
TI  - Contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline HCL tested against Gram-positive pathogens: SENTRY Program results using CLSI and EUCAST breakpoint criteria.
AB  - Tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp. Also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and regulatory-approved documents. We have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline HCL and minocycline when tested against contemporary Gram-positive pathogens. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline HCL activity via reference methods (M07-A9) using a worldwide collection of S. aureus (SA; 4917 strains with 1955 MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 1899), S. pyogenes (GRA; 246), and S. agalactiae (GRB; 217). Regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline HCL of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for MRSA/SPN/GRB/GRA, respectively. Lower EUCAST susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/mL) for GRA to -8.9% (</=1 mug/mL) for MRSA (97.2% susceptible by CLSI; 88.3% by EUCAST). Use of tetracycline HCL-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (CLSI) to 98.4% to 99.6% (EUCAST) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the CLSI breakpoints (14.7%) compared to EUCAST criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for MRSA testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. In conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline HCL when testing SA (especially MRSA) and pathogenic streptococci. When testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. We conclude that EUCAST breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/mL) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel pleuromutilin derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thioether moiety has been  synthesized via acylation reaction under mild conditions. Their in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. Among the 17 compounds screened, 14-O-[(4-methoxybenzamide-2- methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 4i, 14-O-[(2-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5a and 14-O-[(4-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5c were resulted as most active antibacterial agents.
TI  - Host adapted intramammary infections in pregnant heifers which were co-housed and reared on fresh milk as calves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heifers can calve down with intramammary infections (IMI) and udder damage. This will have a negative impact on their longevity, future milk yield and financial return. Co-housed pre-weaned calves that are fed fresh milk have the opportunity to suckle each other's teats and may infect udders of fellow heifer calves with pathogens present in milk. The prevalence of IMI in pregnant heifers in South Africa (SA) which were co-housed and reared on fresh milk as calves, is not known. Quarter secretion samples from both pregnant heifers (n = 2065) and dry cows (n = 5365) were collected for microbiological analysis from eight SA dairy herds. All heifers tested in this study were co-housed pre-weaning and were fed fresh milk as calves. RESULTS: The prevalence of coagulase negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, environmental streptococci, coliforms and samples with no bacterial growth in heifers was 26%, 0.9%, 0.08%, 1.4%, 0.4% and 66%, respectively. The overall prevalence ratio between heifers and cows for Staphylococcus aureus IMI was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.98). Four of the individual herds had prevalence ratios of less than one (p < 0.05), one herd had a prevalence ratio of 3.15 (95% CI: 1.52, 6.32), and the remaining 3 herds had a prevalence ratio not significantly different from 1.0. Marginally significant differences were found between Staphylococcus aureus IMI in pregnant heifers compared to cows in their second and later lactations (p = 0.06, p = 0.05, respectively) but no significant differences between heifers and cows in their first lactation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Streptococcus agalactiae IMI in heifers came as a surprise, especially as herd infection rates were low. The high prevalence ratio of Staphylococcus aureus between heifers and cows in one herd warrants further investigation due to the potential danger of udder damage in a young cow at the start of her productive life. The IMI in heifers with host adapted pathogens can also act as a source of new IMI for lactating dairy cows.
TI  - Group B streptococcal bacteremia in a major teaching hospital in Malaysia: a case series of eighteen patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of infections such as  meningitis and septicemia in neonates and pregnant women; however the significance of invasive GBS disease has not been clearly defined in non-pregnant adults. METHODS: We reviewed the hospital records of 18 cases with GBS bacteremia who attended the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre from June 2010 to October 2011. We analyzed the clinical findings of both bacteremic adults and neonates and compared them to previous studies of GBS bacteremia. Serotyping was done by latex agglutination test using 10 distinct antisera (Ia, Ib, and II-IX). RESULTS: During the period of 1 year and 4 months, there were 18 patients with GBS bacteremia. Five cases occurred in neonates, one in a parturient woman, and 12 in other adults. All neonates with bacteremia were males and two of them were premature. Septicemia was the most common clinical presentation in neonates. They were treated with intravenous (IV) penicillin G and gentamicin. The adults included nine men (69%) and four women (31%). Their mean age was 60 years and all patients had more than two underlying conditions. The most common clinical syndrome was pneumonia (n=6, 46.5%). The others were peritonitis (n=3, 23.1%), primary bacteremia (n=2, 15.5%), septic arthritis (n=2, 15.5%), skin and soft tissue infection (n=1, 7.7%), meningitis (n=1, 8%), urinary tract infection (n=1, 8%), and intravascular device infection (n=1, 7.7%). Cardiovascular diseases (n=7, 53.8%) were the most common underlying conditions, and diabetes mellitus (n=5, 38.5%) was second. The other co-morbid conditions were hyperlipidemia (n=3, 23.1%), renal disease (n=3, 23.1%), liver disease and/or alcohol abuse (n=3, 23.1%), autoimmune disease or immunosuppressive condition (n=2, 15.5%), malignancy (n=2, 15.5%), respiratory disease (n=1, 8%), and postpartum condition (n=1, 8%), as well as miscellaneous conditions including intravenous drug abuse, HIV infection, and trauma (n=2, 15.5%). Polymicrobial bacteremia was found in five (45.4%) cases and Staphylococcus aureus was the most common concurrent bacterial isolate. Of the 18 GBS isolates in both adults and neonates, serotype Ia was predominant (38.9%), followed by VI (27.8%), V (11.1%), and III (5.5%); the remaining 16.7% were non-typeable. CONCLUSIONS: GBS bacteremia is a significant problem and is associated with serious underlying disease, which may result in a high rate of mortality, not only in neonates and pregnant women, but also in non-pregnant adults.
TI  - Vacuum assisted vegetation extraction for the management of large lead vegetations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete device and lead removal is recommended for management of infected implantable cardiac device. Management of large lead vegetation (2 cm) is still in debate. METHODS: We report a series of patients involving percutaneous extraction of large vegetations (>2 cm) from ICD/pacing leads using the AngioVac Cannula in patients with infective endocarditis. This approach was used to debulk the ICD/pacing lead vegetations in order to minimize the risk of septic pulmonary embolism during lead explantation. CONCLUSION: AngioVac Cannula can be used safely and effectively as an adjunctive method for patients with large lead vegetation.
TI  - Assessment of a semi-automated protocol for multiplex analysis of sepsis-causing  bacteria with spiked whole blood samples.
AB  - Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. Recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. In this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. We spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial DNA with the NorDiag Arrow device, using the SelectNA Blood pathogen DNA isolation kit. DNA extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and microarray-based Prove-it Bone and Joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/mL (CFU/mL). To understand the recovery losses of bacterial DNA during the sample preparation step and the capability of the PCR- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the PCR and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. In addition, the inclusivity of the Prove-it Bone and Joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones carrying SCCmec types I, II, IV, or V and a nontypable SCCmec type. The proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial DNA extraction method combined with the high-throughput PCR- and microarray-based platform. Further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.
TI  - Defining standardized protocols for determining the efficacy of a postmilking teat disinfectant following experimental exposure of teats to mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to define standardized protocols for determining  the efficacy of a postmilking teat disinfectant following experimental exposure of teats to both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The standardized protocols describe the selection of cows and herds and define the critical points in performing experimental exposure, performing bacterial culture, evaluating the culture results, and finally performing statistical analyses and reporting of the results. The protocols define both negative control and positive control trials. For negative control trials, the protocol states that an efficacy of reducing new intramammary infections (IMI) of at least 40% is required for a teat disinfectant to be considered effective. For positive control trials, noninferiority to a control disinfectant with a published efficacy of reducing new IMI of at least 70% is required. Sample sizes for both negative and positive control trials are calculated. Positive control trials are expected to require a large trial size. Statistical analysis methods are defined and, in the proposed methods, the rate of IMI may be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. The efficacy of the test product can be evaluated while controlling for important covariates and confounders in the trial. Finally, standards for reporting are defined and reporting considerations are discussed. The use of the defined protocol is shown through presentation of the results of a recent trial of a test product against a negative control.
TI  - Donor-derived bacteremia in liver transplant recipients despite antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  - As the disparity between the number of candidates listed for transplant and the number of donors continues to grow, marginal organ donors are increasingly utilized. This includes bacteremic donors which may carry an increased risk of transmission of infection. It is recommended that recipients of organs from bacteremic donors receive antibiotic prophylaxis based on the susceptibilities of the donor isolate to prevent transmission. Here, we present four cases of donor-derived bacteremia, despite appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, in four liver transplant recipients. Transmitted pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus in two cases, and Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus each in one case. Interestingly, none of the nonhepatic organs (n=10) utilized from these bacteremic donors resulted in transmissions. These cases highlight the fact that risk of transmission from bacteremic donors is not eliminated with antimicrobial therapy in the donor and recipient. As no transmissions occurred in recipients of nonhepatic organs from these donors, these cases also suggest that liver recipients may be at higher risk of donor transmitted bacteremia.
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees C and -20 degrees C on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen (N) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. Bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen. An effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the South African National Milk Recording Scheme (NMRS) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/mL milk. The organisation responsible for sample collection of the NMRS milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. This existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.Ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. An additional sampling was performed at week 30 for samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees C. Freezing and cryopreservation did not impair subsequent isolation of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus (STH) (phage type lytic group III) or Sta. aureus (STA) (phage typed, other than lytic group III). Survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. The survival of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and Escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. Coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.Both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in South African dairy herds.
TI  - Influence of the vaginal microbiota on toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 production by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a serious illness that afflicts women of  premenopausal age worldwide and arises from vaginal infection by Staphylococcus aureus and concurrent production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Studies have illustrated the capacity of lactobacilli to reduce S. aureus virulence, including the capacity to suppress TSST-1. We hypothesized that an aberrant microbiota characteristic of pathogenic bacteria would induce the increased production of TSST-1 and that this might represent a risk factor for the development of TSS. A S. aureus TSST-1 reporter strain was grown in the presence of vaginal swab contents collected from women with a clinically healthy vaginal status, women with an intermediate status, and those diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial supernatant challenge assays were also performed to test the effects of aerobic vaginitis (AV)-associated pathogens toward TSST-1 production. While clinical samples from healthy and BV women suppressed toxin production, in vitro studies demonstrated that Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus spp. significantly induced TSST-1 production, while some Lactobacillus spp. suppressed it. The findings suggest that women colonized by S. aureus and with AV, but not BV, may be more susceptible to menstrual TSS and would most benefit from prophylactic treatment.
TI  - Recent developments and current issues in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of bacterial and fungal neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Identifying neonates with sepsis is complicated by variability in clinical presentation. The incidence of early onset sepsis (EOS) resulting from invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) infections has been notably reduced by the widespread delivery of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Rates of EOS attributable to non-GBS etiologies have remained constant, and ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli has become more prevalent. Late-onset sepsis (LOS) attributable to gram-positive organisms including coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among premature infants. Invasive candidiasis is an emerging cause of LOS, especially among infants who receive broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Prophylactic fluconazole administration to very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates during the first 6 weeks of life prevents invasive candidiasis in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) with high rates of fungal infections. Targeted fluconazole prophylaxis may be beneficial in VLBW neonates who receive care in NICUs with lower rates of invasive fungal infections. Assessment of immune function, neutrophil markers, acute phase reactants, and utilization of sepsis screening scores may contribute to the management of sepsis. Maternal decolonization, antimicrobial stewardship, early enteral feeding, and optimal infection control practices are potential practical strategies for reducing the burden of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Short communication: relationship between herd intramammary infection incidence and elimination rate during the dry period.
AB  - The objective of the study was to explore the relationship between herd dry period (DP) intramammary infection (IMI) incidence and elimination rates. A cohort of 91 Canadian dairy herds was recruited and followed in 2007 and 2008. Universal dry cow therapy was widely adopted among the participating herds. At the beginning of years 2007 and 2008, a sample of 15 cows was selected in each herd. A series of quarter-milk samples consisting of 2 predry and 2 postcalving samples were collected on each quarter of these 30 cows. Milk samples were analyzed using routine bacteriological milk culture, and predry and postcalving IMI statuses of these quarters were established using parallel interpretation of the 2 predry and 2 postcalving tests, respectively. Intramammary infection status was defined as IMI by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), or Corynebacterium spp. Incidence and elimination rates of DP IMI were computed for each herd. Lowess curves and linear regression were used to investigate the association between DP IMI incidence and elimination rates. Significant negative associations were found between incidence and elimination rates of Staph. aureus and CNS. The relationship between incidence and elimination rates was nonlinear for CNS, with a relatively strong negative relationship between DP IMI incidence and elimination rates for herds with relatively low DP IMI incidence (<0.10 new IMI/quarter-month). For herds with higher DP IMI incidence (>/= 0.10 new IMI/quarter-month), a weaker negative relationship was observed between rates. No significant associations could be seen between DP incidence and elimination rates of streptococci other than Strep. agalactiae and of Corynebacterium spp. These results suggest that, conversely to the general belief, acquisition of new IMI and elimination of existing IMI during the DP may be driven, at least for staphylococci, by common mechanisms. The use of management strategies that would lead to the selection of pathogens less well adapted to the host could explain the associations observed between acquisition and elimination of IMI over the DP.
TI  - Molecular screening of ovine mastitis in different breeds.
AB  - Clinical and subclinical mastitis directly affect mammary gland function and have a great economic impact on the sheep and goat dairy industries. The present study explores molecular diagnosis of ovine subclinical mastitis as a faster and more precise screening method compared with microbiology and biochemical techniques to assess the molecular and chemical properties of raw milk samples from healthy animals from 3 breeds of sheep raised in Portugal. Based on 16S ribosomal RNA screening by PCR, milk samples from all sheep were categorized as contaminated (n=123) or noncontaminated (n=104). For contaminated milk, different specific primers were used for pathogen identification (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis). Streptococcus agalactiae was identified as the most frequent agent. We further assessed whether contaminated versus noncontaminated samples were chemically different in terms of fat, protein, lactose, pH, and solids-not-fat. This molecular screening method allowed rapid and efficient identification of contaminated raw sheep milk, including pathogen identification, before significant alterations in milk chemical properties could be detected. This methodology may lead to a specific and efficient animal treatment and consequently less expensive flock management.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of black thyme (Thymbra spicata L.) essential oils.
AB  - In order to study antimicrobial effects of essential oils of Wild Thyme (Thymbra  spicata L.) on two Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae RJTTC1978 and Staphylococcus aureus RJTTC1885) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli RJTTC2409 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RJTTC1097), the research carried out with five concentrations (0.2, 2, 4, 10 and 20 microl) using disk diffusion and microbroth dilution (to determine MIC and MBC) methods at Ilam University during 2010. Tetracycline and Gentamicin discs were used as control. Chemical composition of the EOs was analyzed by GC-MS. Antioxidant activity of the essential oils (EOs) was measured following DPPH assay. Results showed that Carvacrol (60.36%), gamma-Terpinene (15.09%), beta-Myrcene (2.15%), trans-Caryophyllene (1.78%) and alpha-Thujene (1.54%) were the main components of the oils. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity revealed that the oils were active against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. However, the biggest growth inhibitory zone (33.34 +/- 0.5 mm) was recorded on Streptococcus agalactiae at 20 microl/ml concentration. The lowest MIC (3.12 microl/ml) observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, while minimum MBC (6.25 microl/ml) recorded on Klebsiella pneumoniae. Radical-scavenging ability of the EOs and BHT ranged from 9.93 +/- 2.57 to 77.81 +/- 1.3% and 80.48 +/- 0.56 to 10.66 +/- 1.11%, respectively. The inhibiting effect of Thymbra oils was stronger than the synthetic BHT, particularly at lower concentrations, as IC50 concentration of EOs for the reduction of DPPH radicals was 1.28 microl/ml which was lower than IC50 calculated for BHT (1.31 microl/ml). The total phenolic content, determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, was 1.52 +/- 0.15 mg PyE/ml EOs.
TI  - [Clinical course of acute respiratory infection and the state of microbiocenosis  of upper respiratory tract in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Evaluate clinical features of the course of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and the state of microbiocenosis of nasopharynx of pregnant women at gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the stage of outpatient therapy of ARI 49 pregnant women at the gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks were examined: group 1--27 individuals consulting at day 1 and receiving Viferon (gel) intranasally for 10 days, group 2--22 individuals consulting at day 2 - 3 and receiving Viferon (gel and suppositorium). Respiratory viral infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Bacteriologic study of discharge from the middle section of the pharynx was performed by the standard technique. RESULTS: ARI in group 1 of pregnant women were regarded as mild severity and persisted for an average of 3 days. In group 2 in 13 (59%) of patients ARI of moderate severity was noted and the recovery occurred at day 6. Pyo-inflammatory diseases of ENT organs appeared in 10 (45.4%) of patients. Respiratory infections were determined in 16 (32.7%) of them: coronaviruses--in 5 (10.2%), rhinoviruses--in 3 (6.2%), respiratory syncytial viruses--in 6 (12.3%), parainfluenza (type 2) and influenza A viruses--1 (2%) both, without significant differences between the observed groups. Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus pyogenes with the predominance of the latter in 36.7% and 60% of cases, respectively, in pregnant women of the group 2 (p < 0.01), were detected in the microflora of the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Viferon preparation therapy prescribed at day 1 of outpatient visit of pregnant women may promote mild course o fARI and prophylaxis of complications of upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new MRSA-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2010. In over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility. An alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the USA. Very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at </= 8 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing S. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone MIC at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible category) when testing Haemophilus influenzae. Only when testing indicated Enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). These presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.
TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of a hand-held milk electrical conductivity meter compared to the California mastitis test for mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - Screening tests for mastitis can play an important role in proactive mastitis control programs. The primary objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of milk electrical conductivity (EC) to the California mastitis test (CMT) in commercial dairy cattle in South Africa using Bayesian methods without a perfect reference test. A total of 1848 quarter milk specimens were collected from 173 cows sampled during six sequential farm visits. Of these samples, 25.8% yielded pathogenic bacterial isolates. The most frequently isolated species were coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=346), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=54), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=42). The overall cow-level prevalence of mastitis was 54% based on the Bayesian latent class (BLC) analysis. The CMT was more accurate than EC for classification of cows having somatic cell counts >200,000/mL and for isolation of a bacterial pathogen. BLC analysis also suggested an overall benefit of CMT over EC but the statistical evidence was not strong (P=0.257). The Bayesian model estimated the sensitivity and specificity of EC (measured via resistance) at a cut-point of >25 m ohm/cm to be 89.9% and 86.8%, respectively. The CMT had a sensitivity and specificity of 94.5% and 77.7%, respectively, when evaluated at the weak positive cut-point. EC was useful for identifying milk specimens harbouring pathogens but was not able to differentiate among evaluated bacterial isolates. Screening tests can be used to improve udder health as part of a proactive management plan.
TI  - Examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Major mastitis pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens such as Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (IMI) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (NIMI) with a major pathogen. To investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of IMI with minor pathogens on the acquisition of NIMI with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The total extant English- and French-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. Results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. Random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of CNS and C. bovis on acquisition of new IMI with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and Staph. aureus. Significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. Overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. Underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. Larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen IMI identified less protection. Smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.
TI  - Bayesian estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of a multiplex real-time PCR assay and bacteriological culture for 4 common bovine intramammary pathogens.
AB  - Bacteriological culture (BC) is the traditional method for intramammary infection diagnosis but lacks sensitivity and is time consuming. Multiplex real-time PCR (mr-PCR) enables testing the presence of several bacteria and reduces diagnosis time. Our objective was to estimate bacterial species-specific sensitivity (Se) and specificity of both BC and mr-PCR tests for detecting bacteria in milk samples from clinical mastitis cases and from apparently normal quarters, using a Bayesian latent class model. Milk samples from 1,014 clinical mastitis cases and 1,495 samples from apparently normal quarters were analyzed by BC and mr-PCR. Two positive culture definitions were used: >/=1 cfu/0.01 mL and >/=10 cfu/0.01 mL of the specified bacteria. The mr-PCR was designed to simultaneously detect Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The priors used in our Bayesian model were weakly informative, with BC priors using the best available error data. Results were compared with those obtained using uniform priors for mr-PCR to test robustness. Weak and uniform priors gave about the same posterior distributions except for Strep. uberis from normal quarters and Strep. agalactiae. Multiplex real-time PCR Se on milk from clinical mastitis were lower than mr-PCR Se on milk from normal quarters. Multiplex real-time PCR Se was higher than BC on milk from normal quarters. Multiplex real-time PCR Se was generally lower than BC on milk from clinical mastitis and it varied by clinical severity. The estimate specificities of detection for all pathogens were >/=99%, regardless of sample type. The effect of milk sample preservation before testing was evaluated and may have been a factor that affected our observed results. A significant association was observed between sample age and mr-PCR results leading to reduced detection of E. coli and Strep. agalactiae in nonclinical samples. Differences in sample age between conduct of BC and of mr-PCR did not concur with any apparent differences between Se estimates of the 2 tests. Further work should be done to extend these results to other PCR-based tests for detecting bacterial species in milk samples, for which presented results could be used as prior parameter distributions. Limits of sample handling and storage and the potential existence of substances in clinical case samples that may interfere with PCR reactions also are worth further investigation.
TI  - Whole-cell MALDI-TOF MS: a new tool to assess the multifaceted activation of macrophages.
AB  - Whole-cell MALDI-TOF MS is routinely used to identify bacterial species in clinical samples. This technique has also proven to allow identification of intact mammalian cells, including macrophages. Here, we wondered whether this approach enabled the assessment human macrophages plasticity. The whole-cell MALDI-TOF spectra of macrophages stimulated with IFN-gamma and IL-4, two inducers of M1 and M2 macrophage polarisation, consisted of peaks ranging from 2 to 12 kDa. The spectra of unstimulated and stimulated macrophages were clearly different. The fingerprints induced by the M1 agonists, IFN-gamma, TNF, LPS and LPS+IFN-gamma, and the M2 agonists, IL-4, TGF-beta1 and IL-10, were specific and readily identifiable. Thus, whole-cell MALDI-TOF MS was able to characterise M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes. In addition, the fingerprints induced by extracellular (group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus) or intracellular (BCG, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Coxiella burnetii) bacteria were bacterium-specific. The whole-cell MALDI-TOF MS fingerprints therefore revealed the multifaceted activation of human macrophages. This approach opened a new avenue of studies to assess the immune response in the clinical setting, by monitoring the various activation patterns of immune cells in pathological conditions.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from western European countries in 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western Europe. METHODS: Forty-one centres in Spain (8), Italy (9), Germany (8), France (8) and the UK (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 101 VRE, 193 Streptococcus agalactiae and 191 Streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. These were re-identified and susceptibilities to oritavancin and comparators were determined. RESULTS: Oritavancin was very active against MRSA (MIC(50)/MIC(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/L), MRCoNS (0.06/0.12 mg/L), VRE (0.03/0.06 mg/L), S. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/L). The highest oritavancin MIC observed was 0.25 mg/L (species were S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis). CONCLUSIONS: These data from recently collected Gram-positive bacteria in western Europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant MRSA, MRCoNS and VRE isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.
TI  - Quality of bulk tank milk samples from Danish dairy herds based on real-time polymerase chain reaction identification of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Results of a commercial real-time PCR analysis for 11 mastitis pathogens from bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from all 4,258 Danish dairy herds in November 2009 to January 2010 were compared with somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacteria count (TBC) estimates in BTM. For Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis, a low real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value (corresponding to high bacterial DNA quantity) was correlated with higher SCC and higher TBC. For Staphylococcus aureus, low Ct values were correlated only with higher SCC. For the environmental mastitis pathogens Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, low Ct values had a correlation with higher TBC. Staphylococcus spp. were found in the BTM from all herds, Strep. uberis in 95%, Staph. aureus in 91%, and Strep. dysgalactiae in 86%, whereas E. coli, Klebsiella, and Strep. agalactiae were found in 61, 13, and 7% of the herds. It is concluded that the real-time PCR used provides results that are related to the milk quality in the herds. Real-time PCR can be used in the same way as culture for monitoring BTM samples, and is especially useful for bacteria with low prevalence (e.g., Strep. agalactiae).
TI  - [Bacteremia in patients hospitalized with cellulitis].
AB  - Cellulitis is an acute inflammation of dermis and subcutaneous tissue, usually complicating wounds, ulcers, or dermatosis. Even though in these cases it is recommended to perform culture from skin and soft tissue samples, the utility of blood cultures remains controversial due to the low frequency of positive results. Here we report the prevalence of bacteremia in patients with cellulitis admitted in our Hospital, and evaluate the presence of risk factors associated with the occurrence of this event. Clinical records of patients with diagnosis of cellulitis admitted between June 2007 and March 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients without skin and soft tissue culture and/or blood cultures were excluded. Demographic data, presence of comorbidities, and culture results were analyzed. In this period, 140 patients were admitted with this diagnosis. Fifty six (40%) of them had positive skin and soft tissue cultures; where methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the most frequently isolated bacterium species (35.7%). Bacteremia was detected in 8.6% of these cases, where the most frequently isolated bacteria were Group G Beta haemolytic Streptococcus (33%). Bacteremia was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (10.5 +/- 8.98 vs. 4.9 +/- 6, p = 0.004). The following variables were significantly associated with the occurrence of positive blood cultures: diabetes (41.7% vs. 14.1%; p = 0.02; OR 4.4), positive skin and soft tissue culture (75% vs. 35.2%; p = 0.01; OR 5.5), alcoholism (16.7% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.01; OR 4.9), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.7% vs. 0.78%; p = 0.01; OR 25.4).

TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Role of the Group B antigen of Streptococcus agalactiae: a peptidoglycan-anchored polysaccharide involved in cell wall biogenesis.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS) is a leading cause of infections in neonates and an emerging pathogen in adults. The Lancefield Group B carbohydrate (GBC) is a peptidoglycan-anchored antigen that defines this species as a Group B Streptococcus. Despite earlier immunological and biochemical characterizations, the function of this abundant glycopolymer has never been addressed experimentally. Here, we inactivated the gene gbcO encoding a putative UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate:lipid phosphate transferase thought to catalyze the first step of GBC synthesis. Indeed, the gbcO mutant was unable to synthesize the GBC polymer, and displayed an important growth defect in vitro. Electron microscopy study of the GBC-depleted strain of S. agalactiae revealed a series of growth-related abnormalities: random placement of septa, defective cell division and separation processes, and aberrant cell morphology. Furthermore, vancomycin labeling and peptidoglycan structure analysis demonstrated that, in the absence of GBC, cells failed to initiate normal PG synthesis and cannot complete polymerization of the murein sacculus. Finally, the subcellular localization of the PG hydrolase PcsB, which has a critical role in cell division of streptococci, was altered in the gbcO mutant. Collectively, these findings show that GBC is an essential component of the cell wall of S. agalactiae whose function is reminiscent of that of conventional wall teichoic acids found in Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that GBC-like molecules play a major role in the growth of most if not all beta-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Update on control of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae for management of mastitis.
AB  - The primary method of spread for S agalactiae and S aureus is from cow to cow, so prevention focuses on within and between herd biosecurity to reduce or eliminate the reservoir of infection. S agalactiae is an obligate pathogen of the mammary gland, whereas S aureus is more widespread on other cow body sites and in the environment. Both organisms cause persistent infections, with S agalactiae typically causing higher SCC and bacteria counts in milk. Conventional methods of detection through culture perform well at the cow level. In bulk tanks, augmented procedures should be considered. PCR methods show promise of high sensitivity and specificity, at both the cow and bulk tank level. In developed dairy industries, prevalence of infection has decreased dramatically over the past 30 years for S agalactiae. For S aureus, the herd level of infection remains very high, although with rigorous, consistent application of control measures, within-herd prevalence has decreased. Because the milking time is the primary period for new IMI, it is the focal point of most prevention activities. Premilking and postmilking teat disinfection and proper stimulation and milk-out with adequately functioning equipment are key factors. There is growing evidence that the use of milking gloves is an integral part of contagious mastitis control and the production of high-quality milk. Treatment success is dramatically different between the 2 pathogens. For S agalactiae, eradication can be completed rapidly through a culture and treatment program with minimal culling. For S aureus, treatment success, particularly during lactation, is often disappointing and depends on cow, pathogen, and treatment factors. These factors should be reviewed prior to initiating any treatment to determine the potential for cure. Blanket dry cow therapy and strategic culling are important control procedures for contagious mastitis pathogens. Maintaining a closed herd or, at minimum, adhering to clearly defined biosecurity protocols is critical to reduce risk of reintroduction of S agalactiae or the addition of new, potentially more virulent strains of S aureus to endemic herds.
TI  - The role of diagnostic microbiology in mastitis control programs.
AB  - There are a number of important issues for the dairy practitioner to consider in  designing the most appropriate mastitis microbiological service for his or her clients. These include the decision to use enhancement tools or selective agars to optimize sensitivity and specificity. The service should include a monthly BTC service that monitors for the important contagious mastitis organisms: S aureus, S agalactia, and Mycoplasma. At the cow level, a zero tolerance program to protect healthy cows from exposure to contagious mastitis will require a routine culture service to monitor for these pathogens in new herd additions, clinical cases, and all fresh cows and heifers. A wide variety of additional benefits for maintaining good udder health and the production of quality milk can come from a more comprehensive diagnostic service that looks at both individual cow and bulk tank milk. Finally, more practitioners can help their clients economically by implementation of an on-farm TNT culture service and significantly reducing the use of intramammary therapy.
TI  - Diagnostic yield of fluoroscopy-guided biopsy for infectious spondylitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT is currently the method of choice for guiding biopsy of lesions of the spine. However, in our hospital, fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous biopsy has been preferred for several years because of equipment availability and easy craniocaudal angulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous biopsy in a clinical setting for diagnosing infectious spondylitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate 170 fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous biopsies in 140 patients (male/female = 70:70; mean age, 65.1 years; range, 16-89 years) in a clinical setting who were suspected of having infectious spondylitis between July 2003 and March 2010. Diagnosis was based on pathologic confirmation by tissue or culture from biopsy. The percentage of adequate specimens for diagnosis, histopathologic diagnosis for infectious spondylitis, and positive cultures for causative organisms were evaluated by retrospective review of medical records. RESULTS: Adequate specimens for diagnosis were obtained in 165 of 170 cases (97.1%). The diagnosis of infectious spondylitis resulted in 134 of 170 cases confirmed through histopathology or clinical outcome (78.8%). In 51 of 134 cases (38.1%), the causative organism was confirmed by specimens from percutaneous bone biopsy. There were no biopsy-related major complications. The most common organism isolated was Mycobacterium tuberculosis (24 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus viridans. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous biopsy is as accurate and effective as CT-guided biopsy for diagnosing infectious spondylitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - Relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. The balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the Lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe for humans. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of Lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on Lactobacilli isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to Babylon Hospital of Maternity and Paediatrics in Babylon province, Iraq. The study involved the role of intrauterine device among married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. This study also involved studying probiotic role of Lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. RESULTS: Results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. Intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. The most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All Lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (S. aureus, E. coli). Lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. Results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between Lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. This may be attributed to the production of defense factors by Lactobacilli. CONCLUSION: The types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (Lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - The effect of multiplex-PCR-assessed major pathogens causing subclinical mastitis on somatic cell profiles.
AB  - The major pathogens causing mastitis were evaluated by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) with self-designed primers in four quarters of the first, third, and fifth parities in industrial, semi-industrial, and traditional dairy cattle farms in Iran. With the incidence of infection in the quarters by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, the mean log somatic cell count (log SCC) increased from 5.06 to 5.77. The smallest changes occurred with Escherichia coli. Contagious pathogens, when compared with environmental pathogens, were more prevalent and common and created more profound quantitative and qualitative changes in SCC profiles. The second part of the study surveyed the diversity of contaminating pathogens and their effect on quantitative and qualitative profiles of somatic cells. M-PCR was used to determine the absence (M-PCR(-)) and presence of one (M-PCR(+1)), two (M-PCR(+2)), and three (M-PCR(+3)) major pathogens in raw milk samples. Quarter log SCC increased from 5.06 (for M-PCR(-1)) to 5.5 (for M-PCR(+1)), 5.7 (for M-PCR(+2)), and 6 (for M-PCR(+3)). Percent changes in polymorphonuclears (PMNs) were not significant between different quarters and parities but were significant between different farms in terms of pathogen diversity (P < 0.05). Therefore, by increasing the number of types of major pathogens involved in subclinical mastitis, SCC of udder quarters and the proportion of PMNs significantly increased, whereas the proportion of lymphocytes significantly decreased. This subject is very important in increasing the shelf life of dairy products, because PMNs are introduced to the enzymatic pools.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sp Group F, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as IC(50) . Mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. Gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. Regarding phenolic extracts, GSE (grape seed extract) and GSE-O (oligomeric-rich fraction from GSE) were the ones that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.
TI  - Acute toxicity evaluation, antibacterial, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects of Melastoma malabathricum.
AB  - Melastoma malabathricum (MM) is a well-known plant in Malaysian traditional medicine, locally known as senduduk. Its ethanol and aqueous extracts have been used in the present investigation to study the immunomodulatory role on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP free radical scavenging activities were also measured. Total flavonoids and total phenolic contents were assayed and the antibacterial effect was tested against four species of bacteria; two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae) and two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsilla pneumonia). The tests were carried out using the disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. Moreover, the acute toxicity was evaluated in vivo on the ethanol extract of MM to establish its safety when administered orally. In our results, both extracts of MM showed abilities to scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals, IC(50) values: (11.599 +/- 0.84, 10.573 +/- 0.58 micromol/L) and (62.657 +/- 0.78, 63.939 +/- 0.48 micromol/L) for ethanol and aqueous extracts respectively. Indeed the ethanol extract evidenced high phenolic content (384.33 +/- 0.005 mg/g), flavonoids contents (85.8 +/- 0.009 mg/g) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (33,590 +/- 0.038 mmol/g), with high activity against S. aureus and S. agalactiae (11 +/- 0.3 and 12 +/- 0.6 mm inhibition zones). Likewise, the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) viability was increased in response to MM, IC(50) values (1.781 +/- 1.2 and 6.545 +/- 0.93 microg/mL) for ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively. In addition, our results showed that the MM extract is safe even at a high dose of 5,000 mg/kg and has no oral toxicity. These findings suggest the excellent medicinal bioactivity of MM and explain the popularity of this plant in the folk medicine as a remedy for different illnesses.
TI  - Protection against Staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Type 1 lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against LTA have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated Enterococcus faecalis strains. In the present study, we show that antibodies against E. faecalis LTA also bind to type 1 LTA from other gram-positive species and opsonized Staphylocccus epidermidis and Staphylcoccus aureus strains as well as group B streptococci. Inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. Passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against E. faecalis LTA promoted the clearance of bacteremia by E. faecalis and S. epidermidis in mice. Furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine S. aureus peritonitis model. The effectiveness of rabbit antibody against LTA suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.
TI  - Gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone to stabilize its interactive partner Gap3 during biogenesis of serine-rich repeat bacterial adhesin.
AB  - Serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (SRRPs) are important bacterial adhesins that are conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. Fimbriae-associated protein (Fap1) from Streptococcus parasanguinis, was the first SRRP identified; it plays an important role in bacterial biofilm formation. A gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion components is required for Fap1 biogenesis. Two glycosylation-associated proteins, Gap1 and Gap3 within the cluster, interact with each other and function in concert in Fap1 biogenesis. Here we report the new molecular events underlying contribution of the interaction to Fap1 biogenesis. The Gap1-deficient mutant rendered Gap3 unstable and degraded in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation of a gene encoding protease ClpP reversed the phenotype of the gap1 mutant, suggesting that ClpP is responsible for degradation of Gap3. Molecular chaperone GroEL was co-purified with Gap3 only when Gap1 was absent and also reacted with Gap1 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that Gap1 functions as a specific chaperone for Gap3. The N-terminal interacting domains of Gap1 mediated the Gap3 stability and Fap1 biogenesis. Gap1 homologues from Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus also interacted with and stabilized corresponding Gap3 homologues, suggesting that the chaperone activity of the Gap1 homologues is common in biogenesis of SRRPs.
TI  - Assessment of in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial and immune activation potentials of aqueous and ethanol extracts of Phyllanthus niruri.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently much attention has been paid to biologically active plants because of their low production cost and fewer adverse effects compared with chemical drugs. In the present investigation the bioactivity of Phyllanthus niruri ethanol and aqueous extracts was evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: The ethanol extract of P. niruri showed a high level of flavonoid content (123.9 +/- 0.002 mg g(-)(1)), while the aqueous extract showed the highest 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH; IC(5)(0) 6.85 +/- 1.80 micromol L(-)(1)) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS; 46.44 +/- 0.53 micromol L(-)(1)) free radical scavenging activities with high phenol content (376 +/- 0.02 mg g(-)(1)) and elevated levels of ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP; 23 883 +/- 0.019 mmol g(-)(1)) with excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (20 mm inhibition zone) and Streptococcus agalactiae (12 mm inhibition zone), respectively, in addition to the best immune activation potential of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (450.5%). CONCLUSIONS: It is clear from our results that both extracts of P. niruri has excellent bioactivity roles via elevated levels of antibacterial, antioxidant and percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, which could lead to the development of medications for clinical use.
TI  - Major causes of mastitis and associated risk factors in smallholder dairy farms in and around Hawassa, Southern Ethiopia.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was carried out from October 2008 to May 2009 in smallholder dairy farms in and around Hawassa to estimate the prevalence of mastitis, to isolate and characterize major bacterial pathogens, and to identify possible associated factors. The study involved a total of 201 milking cows randomly drawn from smallholder farms. The prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis was determined through clinical examination of the udder and using mastitis indicator paper (Bovivet indicator paper, Kruuse, Denmark). The prevalence of mastitis at cow and quarter level was 30.3 (61/201) and 10.3 (79/766), respectively. Subclinical mastitis was 25.4% and 5.0% was clinical. Stage of lactation significantly affected (P < 0.05) the prevalence of mastitis, with the highest prevalence observed in the late stage of lactation (41.3%) as compared to early (25.0%) and mid (22.1%) stages of lactation. Floor type and bedding had association (P < 0.05) with mastitis prevalence. Cows housed in concrete-floored houses had lower prevalence (19.0%) of mastitis compared to cows kept in soil-floored houses (47.6%). Mastitis prevalence was low in farms which do not use bedding (23.5%) as compared to farms using hay/straw bedding (37.4%). However, age, parity, and history of mastitis had no association (P > 0.05) on the prevalence of mastitis. The pathogens isolated from mastitic cows were Staphylococcus aureus (48.6%), other staphylococci species (15.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (11.4%), other streptococci (17.1%), Bacillus species (2.9%), and coliforms (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species) (4.3%). Strict hygienic measure of housing and bedding should be considered, in reducing the prevalence of mastitis.
TI  - The microbiology of tonsils in khamis civil hospital, saudi arabia.
AB  - Objectives. Tonsillitis is a common infection in all age groups, especially under the age of five. Organisms causing this condition vary from place to place. Our aim is to find out the main causative agents of this condition in our hospital. Patients and Methods. Fifty-two consenting patients who needed tonsillectomy in Khamis civil hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between September 2006 and April 2007, were enrolled for the study. Swabs were taken from their inner surfaces and cultured for anaerobes and aerobes according to standard microbiological techniques. Results. Fifty-two patients, consisting of 30 males and 22 females were enrolled. Their mean age was 9.81 +/- 6.47. Nearly 65% of patients had positive cultures while 35% were negative. The commonest bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (44.1%); and Group B Streptococcus (35.3 %). Two Gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, (8.82%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.94 %), were also isolated. No anaerobe was isolated. Conclusion. Gram-positive cocci, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), are the major causes of tonsillitis requiring surgery in our hospital. Antibiotic treatment of this condition should be directed largely against these organisms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Combretum molle (Combretaceae) against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from crossbred dairy cows with clinical mastitis.
AB  - Following the rapidly expanding dairy enterprise, mastitis has remained the most  economically damaging disease. The objective of this study was mainly to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activities of ethanol extracts of Combretum molle (R.Br.Ex.G.Don) Engl & Diels (Combretaceae) against antibiotic-resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from clinical cases of bovine mastitis using agar disc diffusion method. The leaf and bark extracts showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus at concentrations of 3 mg/ml while the stem and seed extract did not show any bioactivity. Although both leaf and bark extracts were handled in the same manner, the antibacterial activity of the bark extract against the bacterial strains had declined gradually to a lower level as time advanced after extraction. The leaf extract had sustained bioactivity for longer duration. The susceptibility of the bacteria to the leaf extract is not obviously different between S. aureus and S. agalactiae. Also, there was no difference in susceptibility to the leaf extract between the antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive bacteria. Further phytochemical and in vivo efficacy and safety studies are required to evaluate the therapeutic value of the plant against bovine mastitis.
TI  - Clinico-radiological features of subarachnoid hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images in patients with meningitis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). Causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes. The remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). In addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. Compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Both bacterial and fungal meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on DWI, predominantly around the frontal lobe. This finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.
TI  - A proposal of interpretive criteria for cefoperazone applicable to bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The correct assessment of mastitis pathogens for their susceptibility/resistance  to cefoperazone is currently hampered by the lack of harmonized test conditions and interpretive criteria. The aim of this study was to provide a proposal for clinical breakpoints of cefoperazone which are applicable to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis from cases of bovine mastitis and better reflect the situation in the bovine udder than breakpoints adopted from human medicine. For this, pharmacological data and clinical efficacy data of the documents submitted for approval of cefoperazone have been revisited. In addition, 1086 bacterial pathogens of the aforementioned six species/groups collected in Germany and in the USA during recent years were tested in parallel for their cefoperazone MICs and the zone diameters using a 75 mug disk. Subsequently, MICs were plotted against zone diameters. Based on the pharmacological data, the clinical efficacy and the microbiological data, a proposal was made for veterinary-specific breakpoints which classify members of the aforementioned species/groups as (a) susceptible to cefoperazone when their MIC is </= 2 mug/ml and their zone diameters are >/= 27 mm (staphylococci or E. coli) or >/= 21 mm (streptococci), (b) intermediate when their MIC is 4 mug/ml and their zone diameters are 22-26 mm (staphylococci or E. coli) or 16-20mm (streptococci), and (c) resistant when their MIC is >/= 8 mug/ml and their zone diameters are </= 21 mm (staphylococci or E. coli) or </= 15 mm (streptococci).
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - Multiplex PCR and a chromogenic DNA macroarray for the detection of Listeria monocytogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens in milk and meat samples.
AB  - Food products, such as milk and meat products including cheese, milk powder, fermented milk, sausage, etc. are susceptible to the contamination by pathogenic and deteriorative bacteria. These bacteria include Listeria monocytogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas fluorescens, etc. Traditional methods for the detection of these microorganisms are laborious and time consuming. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. In this study, we designed the DNA probes and PCR primers for the detection of aforementioned microorganisms. By using two sets of multiplex PCR, followed by a chromogenic macroarray system, these organisms in milk or other food products could be simultaneously detected. When the system was used for the inspection of milk or meat homogenate containing 10(0) target cells per milliliter or gram of the sample, all these bacterial species could be identified after an 8h pre-enrichment step. The system consisting of a multiplex PCR step followed by macroarray allowed us to detect multiple target bacterial species simultaneously without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared to the commonly used multiplex PCR method, this approach has the additional advantage of detecting more bacterial strains because some bacterial strains generate PCR products with the same molecular sizes which can be differentiated by macroarray but not by electrophoresis.
TI  - Culture results from milk samples submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories from August 2003 to December 2006 in New Zealand.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the pattern of isolation of major mastitis-causing organisms isolated from milk samples submitted to five veterinary diagnostic laboratories in New Zealand. METHODS: The culture results of 25,288 milk samples that were collected from dairy cows throughout New Zealand from August 2003 to December 2006 and submitted to a group of veterinary diagnostic laboratories were assembled, reviewed and summarised. Logistic regression was used to analyse the effect of year, region (i.e. North vs South Island), and season on the probability of isolating the two most common organisms. RESULTS: The most commonly isolated mastitis causing organisms from all samples were: Streptococcus uberis (23.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (23.5%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; 7.2%), Strep. dysgalactiae (6.2%), Bacillus spp. (4.0%), and coliforms (3.7%). The percentage of samples with isolates of Strep. uberis or Staph. aureus was affected by island, year and season (p<0.001). For most of the year, except in late winter and early spring when Strep. uberis was much more common, the percentage of isolates of Strep. uberis and Staph. aureus were not apparently different despite the former being an environmental pathogen and the other a contagious one. CONCLUSION: The pattern of isolation of major mastitis-causing organisms, as determined from culture of milk samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories in New Zealand, has changed significantly over the last 40 years, with a substantial increase in the percentage of isolates that are Strep. uberis and a decrease in isolates of Strep. agalactiae. There is a clear seasonal pattern to the isolation of both Strep. uberis and Staph. aureus, particularly the former. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the aetiological agents causing bovine mastitis on a farm is of value in determining the choice of treatment. This dataset shows that, although there is seasonal pattern to the isolation of mastitis-causing organisms in New Zealand, both Strep. uberis and Staph. aureus are isolated throughout the year, so bacteriology is of value in determining aetiology even in late winter/early spring.
TI  - Bioactivity of malva sylvestris L., a medicinal plant from iran.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Malva sylvestris L. (Malvaceae), an annual plant, has been already commonly used as a medicinal plant in Iran. In the present work, we evaluate some bioactivities of the plant extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aired-dried plant flowers and leaves were extracted by soxhlet apparatus with n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. The antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and phytotoxic of the plant extracts were evaluated using disk diffusion method, MTT, and Lettuce assays, respectively. RESULTS: Both flowers and leaves of M. sylvestris methanol extracts exhibited strong antibacterial effects against Erwinia carotovora, a plant pathogen, with MIC value of 128 and 256 microg/ml, respectively. The flowers extract also showed high antibacterial effects against some human pathogen bacteria strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Entrococcus faecalis, with MIC value of 192, 200 and 256 microg/ml, respectively. The plant methanol extracts had relatively high cytotoxic activity against MacCoy cell line. CONCLUSION: We concluded that Malva sylvestris can be candidated as an antiseptic, a chemopreventive or a chemotherapeutic agent.
TI  - Maternal-neonatal outcome with Staphylococcus aureus rectovaginal colonization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of rectovaginal colonization by Staphylococcus  aureus among pregnant women with group B streptococcus (GBS) screening results and its association with maternal and infant outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Cultures that detected both group B streptococcus (GBS) and S. aureus were obtained at > or = 35 weeks of gestation. Computerized database search and chart review determined invasive neonatal infection and maternal outcomes at the time of delivery through 6 months postpartum. RESULTS: A total of 6,626 GBS screening cultures met study criteria, and 769 (11.6%) GBS isolates and 67 (1.0%) S. aureus were identified. No maternal S. aureus-related outcomes were found. The rate of maternal methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization was 0.1% (7 in 6,626). GBS-positive patients were twice as likely to be colonized with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus than GBS-negative patients. GBS-positive culture rates differed significantly by primary language: Spanish 10.0%, English 13.7%, Russian 26.9%, Cantonese 13.2%, Mandarin 11.5%, Arabic 15.9%, and other 17.8%. CONCLUSION: In our population, S. aureus colonization percentage (1.0%) was lower than the 7.5-8.2% reported by other medical centers, as was overall GBS carriage rate. S. aureus did not predispose to maternal or infant morbidity or mortality up to 6 months postpartum.
TI  - [Acute bacterial parotitis in infants under 3 months of age: a retrospective study in a pediatric tertiary care center].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute bacterial parotitis is a rare infectious disease in infants under 3 months of age. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and the course of acute bacterial parotitis in infants less than 3 months old. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Infants under 3 months of age, hospitalized at Robert Debre university hospital, Paris, France, between January 2005 and December 2009 for acute bacterial parotitis, were included in a retrospective study. RESULTS: Five infants less than 3 months of age were included in this study, for a frequency of 2.5/1000 hospitalizations in this age group. All were born at term, 4 of 5 were male. Three of the 5 patients had specific clinical signs of parotitis on admission. One patient had septic shock on admission. The ultrasound confirmed the parotitis in all cases. No parotid abscess was demonstrated on imaging. All patients had at least one abnormal inflammatory biological test (WBC, CRP, PCT). Bacteria were identified in 4 of 5 cases: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in the pus culture of the Stenon duct in 2 patients and a group B Streptococcus was isolated from blood culture of 2 other patients. The duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy varied from 4 to 13 days, and the total duration of antibiotic therapy was between 10 and 16 days. No surgical procedures were needed. CONCLUSION: Acute bacterial parotitis in infants under 3 months of age might be associated with localized infections due to S. aureus, but also with a more severe clinical presentation due to group B streptococcus infection. Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy might prevent the progression to serious complications.
TI  - Surveillance of JNJ-Q2 activity tested against Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci as a component of the 2010 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel broad-spectrum bactericidal fluorinated 4-quinolone with potent activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens with a balanced potency against both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV targets. JNJ-Q2 is in clinical development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. With the use of reference broth microdilution methods in a central reference laboratory design, MIC values were obtained for 3650 pathogens (44.4% were from patients diagnosed with ABSSSI) obtained during the 2010 SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program. Isolates were collected from patients in 96 medical centers in 26 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. JNJ-Q2 demonstrated good activity overall (MIC(50/90), 0.015/0.5 mug/mL) and against 3081 Staphylococcus aureus with >95% of the isolates inhibited at a MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL; against 1410 levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates, >90% were inhibited by MIC </=0.5 mug/mL. All isolates were inhibited at a MIC of </=2 mug/mL. In addition, JNJ-Q2 demonstrated excellent activity (MIC(90), 0.015 mug/mL) against 569 isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci (including 278 Streptococcus pyogenes and 161 Streptococcus agalactiae). JNJ-Q2 was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested overall and against all pathogens when compared directly to moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for species identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop and evaluate a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneous detection of 10 bacterial species causing bovine mastitis namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli in milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-tube mPCR assay was developed. The accuracy of the mPCR was evaluated using 56 standard reference strains and 705 strains comprising of E. coli (n = 99), staphylococci (n = 522) and streptococci (n = 84). The threshold of detection of the mPCR assay was 10 fg of genomic DNA and <10(3) CFU ml(-1). A comparative evaluation of mPCR with culture method using 115 milk samples from subclinical mastitis showed mPCR to be more efficacious. Subsequently, the mPCR showed successful detection of target bacteria, when applied directly for the assessment of 36 bulk milk samples. CONCLUSION: The developed mPCR assay was found to be simple, rapid, reliable and specific in species identification of 10 bacteria at a time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay will be useful for the detection of mastitis, testing bacteriological safety of milk and for species level differentiation. The assay will be of value in the dairy sector for diagnosis and research. The early and accurate identification of pathogens will enable timely interventions for the treatment and control of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  - Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. Many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or Staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. A wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies level. These include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. The strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. Molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and disease causation. In this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.
TI  - Identification and characterization of two novel antimicrobial peptides, temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb, from skin secretions of the marsh frog (Rana ridibunda).
AB  - In this study, two novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the marsh frog, Rana ridibunda, named temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb, were identified and purified using RP-HPLC. Temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb are composed of 14 and 12 amino acids, respectively. Our results show that these peptides have inhibitory effects on both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially antibiotic resistant strains prevalent in hospitals, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The sequences and molecular weights of these peptides were determined using tandem MS. The molecular masses were found to be 1242.5 Da for temporin-Rb and 1585.1 Da for temporin-Ra. Human red blood cells tolerated well exposure to temporin-Ra and temporin-Rb, which, at a concentration of 60 microg/ml, induced 1.3% and 1.1% hemolysis, respectively. MIC values of these peptides are suitable for potent antimicrobial peptides. The low hemolytic effect and wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest a possible therapeutic application of these novel peptides.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Cellular compatibility of biomineralized ZnO nanoparticles based on prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.
AB  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with the size of approximately 100 nm were prepared via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (SF) peptide at room temperature. These ZnO NPs have shown the remarkable behavior of low toxicity to gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), and eukaryotic cells (mouse L929 fibroblasts). Bacteriological testing indicated that ZnO NPs presented a 50% inhibitory effect on Streptococcus agalactiae at the concentrations of >100 mM, whereas at the same concentrations, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were hardly inhibited. On the other hand, a remarkable proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli was observed at the concentrations of ZnO NPs <50 mM. Moreover, the cytotoxicity test demonstrated that ZnO NPs mineralized with SF peptide possessed a low toxicity to mouse L929 fibroblasts. The SF peptide coated on the surface of ZnO NPs permitted greater adhesion and consequently greater proliferation of mouse L929 fibroblasts. Besides, from TEM micrographs of the cell ultrastructure, endocytosis of NPs into the cytoplasm can be detected and the ultrastructure of the cell underwent few changes. The cell membrane retained integrity, euchromatin dispersed homogenously inside the cytoplasm, the mitochondrial architecture remained intact, and no intracellular vacuoles were observed. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and selected area electron diffraction patterns of ultrathin cell sections indicated that the crystal structure of NPs was not damaged by the organelle or cytoplasm. All these observations indicated that ZnO NPs mineralized with the SF peptide possess good cytocompatibility.
TI  - Structural differences between the Streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: SrtA and SrtC1.
AB  - The assembly of pili on the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. In Streptococcus agalactiae, the PI-1 pilus island of strain 2603V/R encodes two pilus-specific sortases (SrtC1 and SrtC2) and three pilins (GBS80, GBS52 and GBS104). Although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, GBS80, incorporation of the minor pilins GBS52 and GBS104 into the pilus structure requires SrtC1 and SrtC2, respectively. The S. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, SrtA, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. To understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of S. agalactiae SrtC1 and SrtA. Both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. SrtA exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA but different from that in Staphylococcus aureus SrtA. In contrast, the SrtC1 enzyme contains an N-terminal helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. To understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a SrtC1 mutant, in which the conserved DP(W/F/Y) motif was replaced with the sorting signal motif of GBS80, IPNTG. By comparing the structures of WT wild type SrtA and SrtC1 and the 'lid' mutant of SrtC1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.
TI  - Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria in Makkah hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gram-positive bacteria are important nosocomial pathogens. The objective of this study was to estimate the frequencies and resistance rates of gram-positive pathogens isolated from hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study at three Makkah hospitals from May 2008 to April 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical isolates were collected and demographic and laboratory data were recorded. Standard microbiological methods were used to identify the organisms and test for antimicrobial susceptibility. The results were interpreted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Clinical isolates were collected from 1087 patients. Gram-positive pathogens infected all age groups, but had no gender predominance. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of wound infection and accounted for more than half of the clinical isolates (688 cases). Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) was a common isolate from blood cultures. Wounds were the most common site of infection (37.6%). Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus agalactiae were the second most common bacteria (26%). The resistance rates of S aureus and CONS isolates were 39.4% and 82.4% for oxacillin, respectively. Among the streptococci, the resistance rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 21.1% and 16.7% for ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: S aureus infections were found to be very common in the Makkah hospitals. Infection prevention, control measures and continuous monitoring for antibiotic susceptibility are necessary to reduce these and other nosocomial infections.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - The double life of M-ficolin: what functions when circulating in serum and tethered to leukocyte surfaces?
AB  
TI  - [The characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. The bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various Gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from June 2005 to December 2006. There were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (S.epidermidis, S. xylosus, S.capitis, S.saccharolyticus), Propionobacterium acnes, Streptococcus spp. (S.agalactiae, S.pyogenes) i Corynebacterium spp. (C. striatum, C. amycolatum, C. aquaticum). In the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. The resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Multiplex PCR and reverse line blot hybridization assay (mPCR/RLB).
AB  - Multiplex PCR/Reverse Line Blot Hybridization assay allows the detection of up to 43 molecular targets in 43 samples using one multiplex PCR reaction followed by probe hybridization on a nylon membrane, which is re-usable. Probes are 5' amine modified to allow fixation to the membrane. Primers are 5' biotin modified which allows detection of hybridized PCR products using streptavidin-peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate via photosensitive film. With low setup and consumable costs, this technique is inexpensive (approximately US$2 per sample), high throughput (multiple membranes can be processed simultaneously) and has a short turnaround time (approximately 10 hours). The technique can be utilized in a number of ways. Multiple probes can be designed to detect sequence variation within a single amplified product, or multiple products can be amplified simultaneously, with one (or more) probes used for subsequent detection. A combination of both approaches can also be used within a single assay. The ability to include multiple probes for a single target sequence makes the assay highly specific. Published applications of mPCR/RLB include detection of antibiotic resistance genes(1,2), typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(3-5) and Salmonella sp(6), molecular serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae(7,8), Streptococcus agalactiae(9) and enteroviruses(10,11), identification of Mycobacterium sp(12), detection of genital(13-15) and respiratory tract(16) and other(17) pathogens and detection and identification of mollicutes(18). However, the versatility of the technique means the applications are virtually limitless and not restricted to molecular analysis of micro-organisms. The five steps in mPCR/RLB are a) Primer and Probe design, b) DNA extraction and PCR amplification c) Preparation of the membrane, d) Hybridization and detection, and e) Regeneration of the Membrane.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - Investigations on the pattern recognition molecule M-ficolin: quantitative aspects of bacterial binding and leukocyte association.
AB  - M-ficolin is a PRM of the innate immune system, found in serum and associated with leukocytes. We used the soluble form to study specificity toward Gram-positive bacteria and characterized and quantified cell-associated M-ficolin. The binding of M-ficolin to capsulated and noncapsulated strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) and Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. We did not observe binding of M-ficolin to any of 13 serotypes of S. aureus. Dose-dependent binding of M-ficolin was demonstrated for all of the capsulated GBS strains. The binding was abolished by prior treatment of the bacteria with sialidase, indicating that sialic acid is the ligand for M-ficolin on these bacteria. GlcNAc could inhibit the binding, suggesting that M-ficolin binds via its FBG. M-ficolin was found associated with the complement-activating enzyme in serum, and M-ficolin bound to GBS mediated activation of the complement system. M-ficolin expression on leukocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry with anti-M-ficolin mAb. Total M-ficolin of different leukocytes was quantified in detergent extracts. Monocytes and granulocytes showed similar M-ficolin surface expression, 1.1 x 10(5) and 0.7 x 10(5) M-ficolin molecules/cell, respectively. The total M-ficolin content of the cells was 1.5 x 10(6) molecules/monocyte and approximately one-third of this for granulocytes. Lymphocytes contained <1.5% of the amount estimated for monocytes, and none was revealed on the surface of lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of M-ficolin in 25 tissues revealed staining of only granulocytes and monocytes. Reported M-ficolin expression by type II pneumocytes could not be verified. We demonstrate the specific binding of M-ficolin to sialic acids in the capsule of GBS and give quantitative aspects of the cell-associated M-ficolin.
TI  - Risk factors associated with short-term post-treatment outcomes of clinical mastitis.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to characterize 60-d outcomes after treatment of mild (abnormal milk) and moderate (abnormal milk and abnormal udder) cases of clinical mastitis (CM) occurring in a single quarter of cows on Wisconsin farms (n=4) and to determine risk factors associated with those outcomes. Duplicate milk samples were collected from the affected quarter of each cow for microbiological analysis at the onset of CM (PRE) and 21 d later (POST). Cows were treated only in the affected quarter using an intramammary product containing 125 mg of ceftiofur. Bacteriological cure was defined as absence of pathogens in the POST sample obtained from the enrolled quarter. Recurrence was defined for the cow when CM occurred after the milk-withholding period for the enrolled case of CM. Retention in the herd was defined when a cow was retained within the herd for the 60-d follow-up period. Somatic cell count reduction (SCCR) was defined at the cow level as somatic cell count (SCC) below 200,000 cells/mL at the Dairy Herd Improvement Association test day occurring between 21 to 55 d post-treatment. The effects of farm, days in milk, parity, severity, microbiological diagnosis at PRE, previous milk yield, previous SCC, previous occurrence of CM and treatment duration on selected post-treatment outcomes were assessed using Chi-squared analysis and logistic regression. Microbiological results at PRE were distributed as: Escherichia coli (n=14), Klebsiella spp. (n=11), Enterobacter spp. (n=8), Serratia spp. (n=7), other gram-negative species (n=3), Streptococcus spp. (n=25), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=4); Staphylococcus aureus (n=1); Streptococcus agalactiae (n=1), other gram-positive species (n=9), and culture negative (n=60). Treated quarters were more likely to experience bacteriological cure when the cow experienced CM for the first time in the lactation and when no pathogen was recovered from PRE milk samples obtained from the enrolled quarter. Parity and bacteriological cure were associated with the probability of recurrence. Greater milk yield at previous Dairy Herd Improvement test was the most important predictor for retention within the herd. When SCC before CM was >200,000 cells/mL the probability of having SCCR after treatment was decreased. When the case experienced bacteriological cure, the cow was less likely to experience recurrent cases and was more likely to have SCCR below 200,000 cells/mL. Post-treatment outcomes, such as recurrence and SCCR, are strongly associated with bacteriological cure and, when monitored, can be used to help determine if a treatment has been successful. Information about the etiology of CM, history of clinical and subclinical mastitis, and parity are useful to review when making strategic treatment decisions.
TI  - LEADER Program results for 2009: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using 6,414 clinical isolates from 56 medical centers in the United States.
AB  - The LEADER Program monitors the in vitro activity of linezolid in sampled U.S. medical centers using reference broth microdilution methods with supporting molecular investigations in a central laboratory design. This report summarizes data obtained in 2009, the 6th consecutive year of this longitudinal study. A total of 6,414 isolates from 56 medical centers in all nine Census regions across the United States participated in 2009. For the six leading species/groups, the following linezolid MIC(90) values were observed: Staphylococcus aureus, 2 mug/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 1 mug/ml; Enterococcus spp., 2 mug/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 mug/ml; viridans group streptococci, 1 mug/ml; and beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 mug/ml. Linezolid resistance was only 0.34% overall, with no evidence of significant increase in the LEADER Program since 2006. The predominant linezolid resistant mechanism found was a G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA. L3/L4 riboprotein mutations were also found. The mobile multidrug-resistant cfr gene was found in four strains (two S. aureus strains and one strain each of S. epidermidis and S. capitis) from four different states, suggesting persistence but a lack of dissemination. Linezolid continues to exhibit excellent activity and spectrum, and this study documents the need for continued monitoring of emerging mechanisms of resistance over a wide geographic area.
TI  - Rectovaginal Staphylococcus aureus colonization: is it a neonatal threat?
AB  - We sought to determine the rate of Staphylococcus aureus rectovaginal colonization and positive newborn blood cultures. Routinely obtained group B streptococcus (GBS) rectovaginal specimens were cultured for S. aureus using standard microbiology procedures. S. aureus- and GBS-positive blood cultures in infants less than 3 days old were determined from our microbiology database. Overall, 1488 rectovaginal cultures were obtained. Rates of positive GBS, S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) cultures were 20.2%, 8.2%, and 1.7%, respectively. Cultures were positive for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and GBS or MRSA and GBS in 1.6% and 0.3% of women, respectively. There was no association between GBS and MSSA or MRSA. From 1998 to 2008, there were four positive S. aureus blood cultures (0.4/10,000 live births). The rate of early onset GBS-positive blood cultures was 2.8/10,000 live births. S. aureus rectovaginal colonization at 35 to 37 weeks is relatively uncommon and currently does not appear to pose a significant risk of early onset neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  - Despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. One key component of better control of this disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. Mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. Development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial DNA extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples to complement traditional microbiological identification. Extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The detection procedure includes specific genomic DNA amplification by multiplex PCR for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. The specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. The extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. The analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/mL for milk samples spiked with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli, with a tendency for K. pneumoniae. The detection limit was 500 cfu/mL for Strep. uberis and Strep. agalactiae. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. When the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, DNA purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. Of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive Staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16S sequencing. The proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated PCR detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of oral topical agents on microorganisms associated with radiated head and neck cancer patients: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A variety of oral topical agents have been used for prevention and management of radiotherapy-induced adverse effects. The antimicrobial nature of some of the commonly used agents is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial efficacies of various oral topical agents on common microorganisms associated with radiated head and neck cancer patients. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Seven commonly used topical oral agents-0.12% chlorhexidine with alcohol, 0.12% chlorhexidine without alcohol, baking soda-salt rinse, 0.4% stannous fluoride gel, 0.63% stannous fluoride rinse, calcium phosphate mouthrinse, and acemannan hydrogel (aloe vera) rinse-were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial efficacies against four common microorganisms. A combination of baking soda-salt rinse and 0.4% stannous fluoride gel was evaluated as the eighth agent. The microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. An ELISA reader was used to measure the turbidity of microbial culture wells and optical density (OD) values for each of the 960 wells recorded. Mean OD values were rank ordered based on their turbidity. One-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc analysis was used to study differences in OD values (P < .05). RESULTS: Mean OD values classified for topical agents from lowest to highest were chlorhexidine with alcohol, chlorhexidine without alcohol, baking soda- salt, calcium phosphate rinse, and the combination of baking soda-salt and stannous fluoride gel. Mean OD values classified for microorganisms from lowest to highest were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, group B Streptococcus, and Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: A significant difference among the antimicrobial efficacies of topical agents was evident for each of four microorganisms (P < .05). There was also a significant difference among the antimicrobial efficacies of the same topical agent on the four microorganisms tested (P < .05).
TI  - Evaluation of a novel chimeric B cell epitope-based vaccine against mastitis induced by either Streptococcus agalactiae or Staphylococcus aureus in mice.
AB  - To construct a universal vaccine against mastitis induced by either Streptococcus agalactiae or Staphylococcus aureus, the B cell epitopes of the surface immunogenic protein (Sip) from S. agalactiae and clumping factor A (ClfA) from S. aureus were analyzed and predicted. sip-clfA, a novel chimeric B cell epitope-based gene, was obtained by overlap PCR, and then the recombinant Sip-ClfA (rSip-ClfA) was expressed and purified. rSip-ClfA and inactivated S. agalactiae and S. aureus were formulated into different vaccines with mineral oil as the adjuvant and evaluated in mouse models. The rSip-ClfA vaccination induced immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers higher than those seen in groups immunized with inactivated bacteria. Furthermore, the response to rSip-ClfA immunization was characterized as having a dominant IgG1 subtype, whereas both bacterial immunizations produced similar levels of IgG1 and IgG2a. The antiserum capacities for opsonizing adhesion and phagocytosis were significantly greater in the rSip-ClfA immunization group than in the killed-bacterium immunization groups (P < 0.05). The immunized lactating mice were challenged with either S. agalactiae or S. aureus via the intramammary route. At 24 h postinfection, the numbers of bacteria recovered from the mammary glands in the rSip-ClfA group were >5-fold lower than those in both inactivated-bacterium groups (P < 0.01). Histopathological examination of the mammary glands showed that rSip-ClfA immunization provided better protection of mammary gland tissue integrity against both S. agalactiae and S. aureus challenges. Thus, the recombinant protein rSip-ClfA would be a promising vaccine candidate against mastitis induced by either S. agalactiae or S. aureus.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.
TI  - Influence of storage and preservation on microbiological quality of silo ovine milk.
AB  - This study was designed to analyze the effects of the storage and preservation conditions on counts of mesophilic, thermoduric, psychotrophic, coliform, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus organisms in silo ovine milk. A total of 910 analytical determinations were conducted from aliquots of 10 silo ovine milks. The conditions tested were unpreserved and azidiol-preserved milk stored at 4 degrees C, and unpreserved milk stored at -20 degrees C. Milk aged 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-collection for refrigerated aliquots, and 7, 15, and 30 d post-collection for frozen aliquots. The factors silo and storage conditions significantly contributed to variation of all microbiological variables, although milk age effect within storage was only significant for mesophilic, psychrotrophic, and coliform bacteria counts. In refrigerated raw milk, mesophile, psychrotroph, and coliform counts significantly increased over 96 h post-collection, whereas the other groups and bacteria species tested maintained their initial concentration. In all cases, azidiol preservation maintained the initial bacterial concentration in raw sheep milk under refrigeration throughout 96 h. Thus, azidiol was a suitable preservative for microbiological studies in sheep milk. Smallest counts were registered for frozen samples, particularly for coliforms, E. coli, Strep. agalactiae and Staph. aureus. Estimates of mesophilic, thermoduric and psychrotrophic organisms showed similar values on both azidiol-preserved and frozen milk samples. Coliforms and E. coli counts significantly decrease over time after freezing. Consequently, freezing at -20 degrees C could also be appropriate for analysis of mesophilic, thermoduric, and psychrotrophic bacterial groups, but not for coliforms or mammary pathogens.
TI  - A death due to subinvolution of the uteroplacental arteries.
AB  - A 19-year-old G1P0 Caucasian woman died 8 days postpartum because of the subinvolution of the uteroplacental arteries. Microscopic examination of the placental implantation site revealed large, dilated spiral arteries containing partially occluding thrombi in the superficial myometrium. The presence of cytotrophoblasts within and surrounding the spiral arteries was confirmed by low molecular weight cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. Infection of the Cesarean section incision site was demonstrated by the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae Group B in the wound as well as the intrauterine blood clot. Although subinvolution of the placental site may be a cause of delayed postpartum hemorrhage and significant morbidity, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown.
TI  - The effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on Staphylococcus aureus DMST 4745.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (LG) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on S. aureus biofilm formation. Attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological changes of S. aureus DMST 4745 were also made. The results demonstrate that S. agalactiae and B. cereus are more susceptible to LG, citral and geraniol than S. aureus and E. coli. Moreover, they also inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. The LG appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.
TI  - Human papillomaviruses prevalence and genital co-infections in HIV-seropositive women in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso).
AB  - The vaginal swabs among HIV-positive women in Africa often revealed opportunistic infections such as human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Mycoplasma that induce respectively cervix cancer and diseases such as vaginosis, abortions, infertility in through salpingitis. The purposes of this study were to: (1) seek for, the prevalence of pathogens such as HPV and Mycoplasma; (2) characterize the strains of HPV and estimate their prevalence; (3) identify among these women, those who were co-infected by these pathogens in order to cure them. From February 2009 to January 2010, 156 HIV-positive women attending our medical centers and aged from 19-45 years (mean age 33.65 +/- 5.75 years) had voluntarily accepted vaginal specimen's tests. PCR, ELISA and molecular hybridization were used for the identification and characterization of these pathogens. The results revealed the presence of Mycoplasma and HPV in 25.64 and 58.33% cases, respectively. The following HPV genotypes and the following prevalence were recorded: HPV-50'S (24.11%), HPV-18 (21.28%), HPV-30'S (18.44%) and HPV-16 (5.67%). The study also enable the identification of co-infections such as HPV-18 strains with HPV-30'S (5.67%) and HPV-30'S with HPV-50'S (3.55%). Other germs infecting the female genital tract including Candida albicans (20.51%), Escherichia coli (12.18%), Treponema pallidum (3.85%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.21%) and Staphylococcus aureus (1.92%) were isolated. This preliminary research work showed the incidence of several genital pathogens, this could be a springboard for nationwide epidemiological study on HPV strains circulating in Burkina Faso.
TI  - Udder pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in Estonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to estimate the distribution of udder pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in Estonia during the years 2007-2009. METHODS: The bacteriological findings reported in this study originate from quarter milk samples collected from cows on Estonian dairy farms that had clinical or subclinical mastitis. The samples were submitted by local veterinarians to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Laboratory during 2007-2009. Milk samples were examined by conventional bacteriology. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the disc diffusion test. Logistic regression with a random herd effect to control for clustering was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 3058 clinical mastitis samples from 190 farms and 5146 subclinical mastitis samples from 274 farms were investigated. Positive results were found in 57% of the samples (4680 out of 8204), and the proportion did not differ according to year (p > 0.05). The proportion of bacteriologically negative samples was 22.3% and that of mixed growth was 20.6%. Streptococcus uberis (Str. uberis) was the bacterium isolated most frequently (18.4%) from cases of clinical mastitis, followed by Escherichia coli (E. coli) (15.9%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (Str. agalactiae) (11.9%). The bacteria that caused subclinical mastitis were mainly Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (20%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (15.4%). The probability of isolating S. aureus from milk samples was significantly higher on farms that had fewer than 30 cows, when compared with farms that had more than 100 cows (p < 0.005). A significantly higher risk of Str. agalactiae infection was found on farms with more than 600 cows (p = 0.034) compared with smaller farms. The proportion of S. aureus and CNS isolates that were resistant to penicillin was 61.4% and 38.5%, respectively. Among the E. coli isolates, ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline resistance were observed in 24.3%, 15.6% and 13.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the main pathogens associated with clinical mastitis were Str. uberis and E. coli. Subclinical mastitis was caused mainly by S. aureus and CNS. The number of S. aureus and Str. agalactiae isolates depended on herd size. Antimicrobial resistance was highly prevalent, especially penicillin resistance in S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in Korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent Korean children. We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
TI  - Predictive factors for lower extremity amputations in diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) and its predictive factors for lower extremity amputations. A prospective study of 100 patients with DFIs treated at the National University Hospital of Singapore were recruited in the study during the period of January 2005-June 2005. A protocol was designed to document patient's demographics, type of DFI, presence of neuropathy and/or vasculopathy and its final outcome. Predictive factors for limb loss were determined using univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis. The mean age of the study population was 59.8 years with a male to female ratio of about 1:1 and with a mean follow-up duration of about 24 months. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Common DFIs included abscess (32%), wet gangrene (29%), infected ulcers (19%), osteomyelitis (13%), necrotizing fasciitis (4%) and cellulitis (3%). Thirteen patients were treated conservatively, while surgical debridement or distal amputation was performed in 59 patients. Twenty-eight patients had major amputations (below or above knee) performed. Forty-eight percent had monomicrobial infections compared with 52% with polymicrobial infections. The most common pathogens found in all infections (both monomicrobial and polymicrobial) were Staphylococcus aureus (39.7%), Bacteroides fragilis (30.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.0%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (21.0%). Significant univariate predictive factors for limb loss included age above 60 years, gangrene, ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.8, monomicrobial infections, white blood cell (WBC) count >/= 15.0x10(9)/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >/=100 mm/hr, C-reactive protein >/=15.0 mg/dL, hemoglobin (Hb) </=10.0g/dL and creatinine >/=150 micromol/L. Upon stepwise logistic regression, only gangrene, ABI <0.8, WBC >/= 15.0x10(9)/L and Hb </=10.0g/dL were significant.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Real-time PCR assays compared to culture-based approaches for identification of aerobic bacteria in chronic wounds.
AB  - Chronic wounds cause substantial morbidity and disability. Infection in chronic wounds is clinically defined by routine culture methods that can take several days to obtain a final result, and may not fully describe the community of organisms or biome within these wounds. Molecular diagnostic approaches offer promise for a more rapid and complete assessment. We report the development of a suite of real-time PCR assays for rapid identification of bacteria directly from tissue samples. The panel of assays targets 14 common, clinically relevant, aerobic pathogens and demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity using a panel of organisms commonly associated with chronic wound infection. Thirty-nine tissue samples from 29 chronic wounds were evaluated and the results compared with those obtained by culture. As revealed by culture and PCR, the most common organisms were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) followed by Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensitivities of the PCR assays were 100% and 90% when quantitative and qualitative culture results were used as the reference standard, respectively. The assays allowed the identification of bacterial DNA from ten additional organisms that were not revealed by quantitative or qualitative cultures. Under optimal conditions, the turnaround time for PCR results is as short as 4-6 h. Real-time PCR is a rapid and inexpensive approach that can be easily introduced into clinical practice for detection of organisms directly from tissue samples. Characterization of the anaerobic microflora by real-time PCR of chronic wounds is warranted.
TI  - The homodimeric GBS1074 from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - ESAT-6 is a well characterized secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and represents the archetype of the WXG100 family of proteins. Genes encoding ESAT-6 homologues have been identified in the genome of the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae; one of these genes, esxA, has been cloned and the recombinant protein has been crystallized. In contrast to M. tuberculosis ESAT-6, the crystal structure of GBS1074 reveals a homodimeric structure similar to homologous structures from Staphylococcus aureus and Helicobacter pylori. Intriguingly, GBS1074 forms elongated fibre-like assemblies in the crystal structure.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Kill rate of mastitis pathogens by a combination of cefalexin and kanamycin.
AB  - AIM: To assess the bacterial killing rate produced by a combination of cefalexin  and kanamycin at two different concentration ratios. METHODS AND RESULTS: Time-kill kinetics of cefalexin and kanamycin, individually and in combination, were determined against one strain each of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. The combination was tested using two fixed ratios (cefalexin : kanamycin ratios of 1.25 : 1 and 1 : 2.3) and two concentrations of each ratio. Time-kill curves produced with either ratio were quite similar. Against most bacterial species, higher concentrations produced faster kill. In all cases, the combination of cefalexin and kanamycin showed faster and greater kill at lower antibiotic concentrations than those observed with either drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cefalexin and kanamycin results in a fast initial killing of major mastitis pathogens at both concentration ratios. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The combination of cefalexin and kanamycin achieved rapid bacterial kill at concentrations and ratios that can be achieved in vivo following intramammary infusion of a mastitis treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of calf milk pasteurization systems on 6 Pennsylvania dairy farms.
AB  - Waste milk has been fed to calves for many years, but concerns with bacterial contamination as well as possible transmission of diseases have discouraged widespread use of this feed. Pasteurization of waste milk is one option to reduce management risk while utilizing a valuable, low-cost, liquid feed source for calves. However, many farms currently pasteurizing waste milk lack a system to adequately monitor the efficiency of the process. A study was carried out to evaluate 6 on-farm pasteurization systems, including high-temperature, short-time pasteurizers and low-temperature, batch pasteurizers. Milk samples were taken pre- and postpasteurization as well as from the calf buckets and immediately frozen for later bacterial culture. Samples were collected twice daily for 15 d. Milk samples were examined for standard plate count (SPC), coagulase-negative staphylococci count, environmental streptococci count, coliform count, gram-negative noncoliform count, Streptococcus agalactiae count, and Staphylococcus aureus count. Before pasteurization, 68% of the samples had SPC <20,000 cfu/mL, and 39% of samples contained <100 cfu/mL of coliform bacteria. After pasteurization, 96% of samples had SPC <20,000 cfu/mL, and 92% had coliform counts <100 cfu/mL. Bacteria counts were significantly reduced by pasteurization, and pasteurized milk contained acceptable numbers of bacteria in >90% of samples. These results indicate that pasteurization can be very effective in lowering bacterial contamination of milk. However, bacteria numbers significantly increased after pasteurization and, in some cases, bacteria counts in milk fed to calves were similar to prepasteurization levels. Milk handling after pasteurization was identified as an important issue on the farms studied.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against Stx1B subunit of Escherichia coli O157:H7 distinguish the bacterium from other bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The Shiga-like toxins (Stx) are critical virulence factors of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Stx1B subunit plays important roles in EHEC infection. This work aims to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the Stx1B and to investigate their utility in discrimination ELISA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two newly identified mAbs (designated 2H8 and 1B10, respectively) against the Stx1B protein were prepared via hybridoma techniques. The immunoreactivity of both mAbs to the Stx1B protein was confirmed in ELISA and Western blot. Moreover, they differentiate EHEC from Salmonella enteritis, non-Stx1-producing E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-STx1B mAbs are valuable diagnostic reagents for distinguishing EHEC from other bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report regarding the usage of anti-STx1B mAbs in discrimination ELISA. The established ELISA may have potential in clinical surveillance of EHEC infection.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Management practices associated with the bulk-milk prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in Canadian dairy farms.
AB  - When designing mastitis-prevention and control programs, it is important to know  the level of adoption of mastitis-prevention management practices and control programs and the herd-level prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens. Our objectives were to estimate: (1) adoption of recommended mastitis-preventive management on Canadian dairy farms; (2) herd-level prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens on Canadian dairy farms; and (3) associations of certain management practices with the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from the bulk tank milk from Canadian dairy farms. In total, 226 farms participating in dairy herd improvement milk recording were randomly selected. All participating farms in British Columbia had free-stall barns and 85% of farms in Quebec had tie-stall barns. Post-milking teat disinfection was practised on 96% of the farms and 72% had implemented blanket dry-cow treatment. Weighted and province-stratified prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staph. aureus in bulk tank milk was 4% (95% confidence interval: 0-12%) and 74% (95% confidence interval: 61-86%), respectively. Highest Staph. aureus prevalence was found in Nova Scotia (91%) and lowest prevalence in British Columbia (38%). No Mycoplasma spp. were isolated, but detection of Mycoplasma spp. could have been hampered by the frozen shipment and storage of the milk samples. Management practices associated with a lower probability of isolating Staph. aureus were blanket dry-cow treatment and believing that a nutritionist is important in mastitis data review. Having the milking equipment checked by an independent technician at least once a year and rubber mats or mattresses in the free-stall barns were associated with an increased probability of isolating Staph. aureus from the bulk tank. Most of Canadian dairy farms adopted important mastitis-prevention practices, such as post-milking teat disinfection and drying off all cows with antibiotics; however, improvements can still be made. A few management practices were associated with the prevalence of Staph. aureus in bulk tank milk, such as dry-cow treatment and barn type for the lactating cows. Further work has to be carried out to investigate to what extent the associations are causal.
TI  - Trends in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus anovaginal colonization in  pregnant women in 2005 versus 2009.
AB  - In 2005, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) anovaginal colonization in pregnant women at our center (Columbia University Medical Center) was 0.5%, and MRSA-colonized women were less likely to carry group B streptococcus (GBS). In this study, our objectives were to identify changing trends in the prevalence of MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) anovaginal colonization in pregnant women, to assess the association between MRSA and GBS colonization, and to characterize the MRSA strains. From February to July 2009, Lim broths from GBS surveillance samples were cultured for S. aureus. MRSA strains were identified by resistance to cefoxitin and characterized by MicroScan, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa typing, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin PCR. A total of 2,921 specimens from different patients were analyzed. The prevalences of MSSA, MRSA, and GBS colonization were 11.8%, 0.6% and 23.3%, respectively. GBS colonization was associated with S. aureus colonization (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.5 to 2.4). The frequencies of GBS colonization were similar in MRSA-positive (34.2%) versus MRSA-negative patients (21.8%) (P = 0.4). All MRSA isolates from 2009 and 13/14 isolates from 2005 were SCCmec type IV or V, consistent with community-associated MRSA; 12/18 (2009) and 0/14 (2005) isolates were the USA300 clone. Levofloxacin resistance increased from 14.3% (2005) to 55.6% (2009) (P = 0.028). In conclusion, the prevalence of MRSA anovaginal colonization in pregnant women in New York City, NY, remained stable from 2005 to 2009, and USA300 emerged as the predominant clone with a significant increase in levofloxacin-resistant isolates.
TI  - Biological activity of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata (Schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. METHODS: The essential oil from stem bark of Kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GLC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC/MS). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. Inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MIA PaCa-2, HeLa, HL-60, MDA-MB-231 and SW-480) was examined using the MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-Cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. The oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 microg/ml oil. The essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but it did not show any activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in Trypanosoma b. brucei with an IC50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. Radical scavenging activity had an IC50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-Lipoxygenase inhibition (IC50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin E(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. The oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against MIA PaCa-2, HepG-2 and SW-480 cell lines with IC50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. The oil increased caspase 3/7 activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in MIA Paca-2 cells. Camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. However, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, K. longipedunculata, a traditionally used Chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - Intramammary infections with the contagious Staphylococcus aureus genotype B in Swiss dairy cows are associated with low prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The association between the contagious Staphylococcus aureus genotype B (GTB) and the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Streptococcus spp. (non-agalactiae streptococci), was investigated, and the identification of problem herds without genotyping was evaluated. Milk samples from 10 herds with Staph. aureus GTB herd problems (PH cases) were compared with samples from 19 herds with at least one Staph. aureus isolate of non-B genotype (CH cases). All samples were bacteriologically analysed and Staph. aureus genotyping carried out using a ribosomal spacer-PCR. Cow and quarter prevalences of Staph. aureus, CNS and Streptococcus spp. differed significantly between PH and CH groups. PH cases were highly associated with decreased cow prevalences of CNS and Streptococcus spp. These altered prevalences also contributed significantly to the identification of problem herds without resorting to genotyping. Common herd-level risk factors did not explain the difference between the prevalences in PH and CH cases.
TI  - Septicemia of unknown origin causing by Streptococcus agalactiae primary psoas abscess: a case report.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the commonest organism resulting in primary psoas abscesses. However non-staphylococcal primary psoas abscesses have increasingly been published in the literature. Here, the author reports a case of primary psoas abscess in a type II diabetic woman previously diagnosed Streptococcus agalactiae septicemia of unknown origin, which rapidly responded to penicillin plus clindamycin and prompt surgical drainage. Diabetic patients are not only susceptible to soft tissue infection but also primary psoas abscess caused by Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and streptococci from bovine subclinical mastitis cases.
AB  - The prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of Staphylococci and Streptococci were assessed from subclinical mastitis cases. One hundred Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CNS) and 34 Streptococci were identified. The most frequently isolated species were Staphylococcus haemolyticus (27%) and Staphylococcus simulans (24%). Susceptible CNS species revealed the highest resistance to penicillin G (58%), ampicillin (48%), neomycin (20%), and oleandomycin (14%). CNS methicillin resistance rates within 82 isolates were 21.95% and 1.22% by disk diffusion and PCR methods, respectively. These results suggested the disk diffusion method was more prone to yield false positives. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA region from the mecA carrying isolate (S. haemolyticus) was homologous with S. haemolyticus sequences/accessions obtained from GenBank. However, the mecA gene sequence from this isolate was more closely allied with the S. aureus mecA gene of human origins. Identical sequence data was acquired from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, suggesting horizontal gene transfer between the two species. CNS beta-lactamase activity within 81 isolates was 29.63%. The most frequently isolated Streptococcus species were S. uberis (52%) and S. agalactiae (15%). Oleandomycin was the least effective antimicrobial agent on these isolates with 59% susceptibility. Results indicated that CNS and Streptococci exhibited various antimicrobial resistance responses. Consequently, isolation and identification of udder pathogens in herds suffering from subclinical agents is essential to select the most effective antimicrobial agent. Moreover, multiple resistance features of methicillin resistant (MR) isolates should be considered during antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant S. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci blood isolates, 100 Streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 Streptococcus pyogenes and 100 Streptococcus agalactiae). Ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/mL), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. Ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. Based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (BM). BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. Despite its high mortality rate, BM has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. STUDY: BM patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and 2008, were studied. BM was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in CSF. RESULTS: We identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had BM. The mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. Abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. The sensitivity of CSF culture was 75% (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; Staphylococcus aureus, 2; Listeria monocytogenes, 1; Group B Streptococcus, 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1; Streptococcus bovis, 1; and Escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. Five patients died. On admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dL. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL was associated with increased mortality (P=0.028). The model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dL, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of CSF were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BM in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. The clinical and microbiologic features of BM in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.
TI  - Skizzle is a novel plasminogen- and plasmin-binding protein from Streptococcus agalactiae that targets proteins of human fibrinolysis to promote plasmin generation.
AB  - Skizzle (SkzL), secreted by Streptococcus agalactiae, has moderate sequence identity to streptokinase and staphylokinase, bacterial activators of human plasminogen (Pg). SkzL binds [Glu]Pg with low affinity (K(D) 3-16 mum) and [Lys]Pg and plasmin (Pm) with indistinguishable high affinity (K(D) 80 and 50 nm, respectively). Binding of SkzL to Pg and Pm is completely lysine-binding site-dependent, as shown by the effect of the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid. Deletion of the COOH-terminal SkzL Lys(415) residue reduces affinity for [Lys]Pg and active site-blocked Pm 30-fold, implicating Lys(415) in a lysine-binding site interaction with a Pg/Pm kringle. SkzL binding to active site fluorescein-labeled Pg/Pm analogs demonstrates distinct high and low affinity interactions. High affinity binding is mediated by Lys(415), whereas the source of low affinity binding is unknown. SkzL enhances the activation of [Glu]Pg by urokinase (uPA) approximately 20-fold, to a maximum rate indistinguishable from that for [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation in the presence of 6-aminohexanoic acid. SkzL binds preferentially to the partially extended beta-conformation of [Glu]Pg, which is in unfavorable equilibrium with the compact alpha-conformation, thereby converting [Glu]Pg to the fully extended gamma-conformation and accelerating the rate of its activation by uPA. SkzL enhances [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation by single-chain tissue-type Pg activator, approximately 42- and approximately 650-fold, respectively. SkzL increases the rate of plasma clot lysis by uPA and single-chain tissue-type Pg activator approximately 2-fold, confirming its cofactor activity in a physiological model system. The results suggest a role for SkzL in S. agalactiae pathogenesis through fibrinolytic enhancement.
TI  - Microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (Provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling Provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of these voice prostheses. Over a 5-year period, implantation of a Provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. In total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. Out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. The most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was C. albicans, followed by C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The most frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. The mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. Dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. The longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. There is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the device life time.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20 against several micro-organisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities were determined using the microdilution method in 96-well culture plates. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against all the micro-organisms assayed, and for twelve of the eighteen micro-organisms (including the pathogenic Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were achieved for biosurfactant concentrations between 25 and 50 mg ml(-1). Furthermore, the biosurfactant showed antiadhesive activity against most of the micro-organisms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities of biosurfactants obtained from lactobacilli against such a broad group of micro-organisms. Although the antiadhesive activity of biosurfactants isolated from lactic acid bacteria has been widely reported, their antimicrobial activity is quite unusual and has been described only in a few strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained in this study regarding the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of this biosurfactant opens future prospects for its use against micro-organisms responsible for diseases and infections in the urinary, vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in the skin, making it a suitable alternative to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - Effect of heat treatment of bovine colostrum on bacterial counts, viscosity, and  Immunoglobulin G concentration.
AB  - A study was conducted to identify the optimal temperature and time at which heat  treatment of bovine colostrum would least change viscosity and IgG concentrations yet reduce bacterial count. First-milking colostrum with >50g of immunoglobulins/L (measured by colostrometer) was collected from 30 Holstein cows. Aliquots of colostrum were heated for 0, 30, 60, or 90min at 57, 60, or 63 degrees C in a water bath. Samples were examined for viscosity, IgG(1), and IgG(2) concentrations, standard plate count, coagulase-negative staphylococci, environmental streptococci, coliform, gram-negative noncoliform, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus counts. All heat treatments reduced counts of all bacteria groups measured compared with untreated colostrum samples. Heat treatment at >or=60 degrees C denatured IgG(1) compared with untreated colostrum; however, colostral IgG(2) levels were not reduced when temperature was held at 60 degrees C for <60min. Viscosity was not affected when temperature was held at 60 degrees C for <60min. In this study, heat treatment of bovine colostrum at 60 degrees C for 30 or 60min reduced bacterial count, slightly reduced IgG concentration, and did not affect viscosity.
TI  - Epidemiology of pediatric community-acquired bloodstream infections in a children hospital in Paris, France, 2001 to 2008.
AB  - In 2001 to 2008, we documented 483 cases of pediatric community-acquired bacteremia mostly because of Streptococcus agalactiae (< 4 days), Escherichia coli (4 days to 3 months), pneumococci (3 months to 5 years), and Staphylococcus aureus (> 5 years). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination affected the serotype distribution of pneumococcal bacteremia but not its frequency. Serotype 19A represented 12% and 22% of pneumococci in the prevaccine and vaccine periods, respectively.
TI  - Prognostic factors in left-sided endocarditis: results from the Andalusian multicenter cohort.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite medical advances, mortality in infective endocarditis (IE) is still very high. Previous studies on prognosis in IE have observed conflicting results. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in a large multicenter cohort of left-sided IE. METHODS: An observational multicenter study was conducted from January 1984 to December 2006 in seven hospitals in Andalusia, Spain. Seven hundred and five left-side IE patients were included. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Several prognostic factors were analysed by univariate tests and then by multilogistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall mortality was 29.5% (25.5% from 1984 to 1995 and 31.9% from 1996 to 2006; Odds Ratio 1.25; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.97-1.60; p = 0.07). In univariate analysis, age, comorbidity, especially chronic liver disease, prosthetic valve, virulent microorganism such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and fungi, and complications (septic shock, severe heart failure, renal insufficiency, neurologic manifestations and perivalvular extension) were related with higher mortality. Independent factors for mortality in multivariate analysis were: Charlson comorbidity score (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3), prosthetic endocarditis (OR: 1.9; CI: 1.2-3.1), Staphylococcus aureus aetiology (OR: 2.1; CI: 1.3-3.5), severe heart failure (OR: 5.4; CI: 3.3-8.8), neurologic manifestations (OR: 1.9; CI: 1.2-2.9), septic shock (OR: 4.2; CI: 2.3-7.7), perivalvular extension (OR: 2.4; CI: 1.3-4.5) and acute renal failure (OR: 1.69; CI: 1.0-2.6). Conversely, Streptococcus viridans group etiology (OR: 0.4; CI: 0.2-0.7) and surgical treatment (OR: 0.5; CI: 0.3-0.8) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Several characteristics of left-sided endocarditis enable selection of a patient group at higher risk of mortality. This group may benefit from more specialised attention in referral centers and should help to identify those patients who might benefit from more aggressive diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures.
TI  - Mode of action and In Vitro susceptibility of mastitis pathogens to macedocin ST91KM and preparation of a teat seal containing the bacteriocin.
AB  - Mastitis is considered to be the most economically costly disease affecting the dairy industry. Regular dosage of animals with antibiotics, including use of prophylactic concentrations, may select for resistant strains. The purpose of this study was to determine the mode of action of a new bacteriocin (macedocin ST91KM), to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens to antibiotics commonly used in treatment remedies, and to introduce the possible use of an alternative antimicrobial agent. The bacteriocin macedocin ST91KM, produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM, is bactericidal to Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus associated with mastitis infections, including strains resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. Sensitive cells were deformed and secreted nucleotides, K(+) and beta-galactosidase when exposed to macedocin ST91KM. Adsorption of the peptide to target cells decreased in the presence of solvents, suggesting that receptors on the cell surfaces have lipid moieties. No adsorption was recorded in the presence of MgCl2, KI and Na2CO3, suggesting that ionic strength plays an important role. A teat seal preparation containing macedocin ST91KM effectively released the peptide and inhibited the growth of S. agalactiae. Macedocin ST91KM could form the basis for alternative dry cow therapy to prevent mastitis infections in dairy cows as it is effective against pathogens that display resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.

TI  - Invited review: The role of contagious disease in udder health.
AB  - Contagious diseases are a threat to animal health and productivity, both nationally and at the farm level. This makes implementation of biosecurity measures to prevent their introduction and spread within countries and farms a necessity. Mastitis is the most common and costly contagious disease affecting dairy farms in the western world. The major mastitis pathogens are endemic in most countries, and biosecurity measures to prevent introduction and transmission must therefore be implemented at farm level. The 40-yr-old mastitis control plan remains a solid foundation to prevent the spread of contagious intramammary infections. Contagious diseases that do not affect the mammary gland directly may have an indirect effect on mastitis. This is true for list A diseases such as foot and mouth disease, for which biosecurity measures may need to be taken at national level, and for other infections with nonmastitis pathogens such as bovine viral diarrhea virus and Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. Maintaining a closed herd decreases the risk of introduction of pathogens that affect udder health directly or indirectly. If animals are purchased, their udder health history should be evaluated and they should be examined and tested for contagious diseases. Transmission of infections by and to humans and nonbovine animals may occur. Contact with visitors and nonbovine animals should therefore be minimized. Because of globalization and heightened consumer awareness, the importance of biosecurity now supersedes individual farms, and increased pressure to control transmission of contagious diseases can be expected at industry or government levels in western countries and elsewhere.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Trends in udder health and emerging mastitogenic pathogens in South African dairy herds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from South African dairy herds during the period 1996 to April 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. Milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9 provinces in South Africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. Although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general udder health in South Africa. Cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. According to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease in South Africa over the test period. The prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. Mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. The percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. Previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta haemolytic Staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Although Staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in South Africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. This finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described as a minor pathogen) significantly. Isolations of Streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus canis were isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while Enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of teicoplanin against intramammary infections in sheep.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin were evaluated in 10 healthy sheep. After intravenous injection it showed monophasic behaviour, with a short mean (sd) elimination half-life (5 [0.24] hours). After intramuscular injection its bioavailability was 100 per cent but it was absorbed slowly; its elimination half-life was satisfactorily slow (9.23 [0.74] hours). Its efficacy was evaluated in 26 crossbreed sheep with milk positive to strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus agalactiae, and clinical signs of disease. In 19 of them a single intramuscular dose of 6 mg/kg bodyweight resulted in a complete resolution of the clinical signs, and no microorganisms were detected in milk by the fifth day; in the other seven sheep, with more severe intramammary infections, three consecutive daily intramuscular doses of 6 mg/kg bodyweight were necessary. There were no local or systemic side effects and no relapses during 30 days after the treatments in any of the sheep.
TI  - Acute phase proteins in the diagnosis of bovine subclinical mastitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The California mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell count (SCC) are commonly used for diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in cattle. Acute phase proteins (APPs), as alternative biomarkers of mastitis, may increase in concentration in the absence of macroscopic changes in the milk, or may precede the onset of clinical signs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of APPs measured in milk and in serum with bacterial culture for the diagnosis of bovine subclinical mastitis. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five Holstein cows were randomly selected from 7 dairy farms. Quarter milk and serum samples were taken from all cows. Milk samples were analyzed using a CMT and SCC, and for haptoglobin (MHp) and amyloid A (MAA) concentrations, and were also submitted for bacterial culture. Serum samples obtained concurrently were analyzed for haptoglobin (SHp) and amyloid A (SAA). Two-sample Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test was used to compare SCC, MAA, MHp, SAA, and SHp concentrations between culture-positive and culture-negative animals. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the performance of each test using bacterial culture as the reference method. RESULTS: MAA concentration was the most accurate of the 5 tests, with a sensitivity of 90.6% and specificity of 98.3% at concentrations >16.4 mg/L. MAA and MHp had significantly larger areas under the curve than the respective serum proteins, SAA and SHp. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that measuring haptoglobin and amyloid A in milk is more accurate than serum analysis for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in Holstein cows.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.
TI  - Osteopontin enhances phagocytosis through a novel osteopontin receptor, the alphaXbeta2 integrin.
AB  - Osteopontin (OPN) is a cytokine with multiple functions, including immune defense mechanisms against invading microorganisms. OPN-deficient mice are impaired in clearing intracellular pathogens, suggesting an important role of OPN during phagocytosis, but it remains to be defined how OPN may enhance this innate immune process. Here, we demonstrate that OPN binds to monocytes, but not resting T cells, NK cells, or B cells, and mediates chemoattraction of IL-1-activated human monocytes. Moreover, OPN binds in a specific manner to all known serotypes of the two bacterial species Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and opsonizes these bacteria for phagocytosis. We identify the integrin alpha(X)beta(2) (CD11c/CD18), which is highly expressed on the cell surface of monocytes, as a novel OPN receptor. To eliminate the contribution from other molecular interactions between the bacteria and the phagocyte, we show that OPN-coated synthetic beads are phagocytosed in an alpha(X)beta(2) integrin-dependent manner. The ligand recognition does not involve the RGD motif previously reported to support binding of OPN to integrins. Taken together, these data identify the alpha(X)beta(2) integrin as a novel OPN receptor that is required for OPN-mediated phagocytosis, thereby elucidating an important mechanism of an innate immune function of OPN.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against multiresistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The activity of daptomycin against 141 Staphylococcus aureus and 63 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates was assessed. The isolates were previously characterized and showed resistance to the antibiotics normally used against gram-positive cocci. Daptomycin was active against 100% of the isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC(90)] = 0.5 microg/ml, for both species). This antibiotic shows good in vitro activity; therefore, it is an excellent therapeutic alternative against these isolates.
TI  - Severe enterovirus disease in febrile neonates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fever in newborn infants may be due to an invasive infection with potential morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to describe the characteristics and outcome of group of febrile neonates with severe enterovirus infection compared to a group of neonates with severe bacterial infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study including all neonates (<29 days old) admitted to a teaching hospital for fever (>38 degrees C), with positive bacterial cultures or enterovirus detection in sterile samples, from September 2003 to December 2004. Clinical information, analytical data at admission (complete leukocyte count and C-reactive protein concentrations), blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid culture results, molecular detection of enterovirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Invasive bacterial infections were observed in 62 patients: urinary tract infection (n=57, including 8 cases of bacteremia), sepsis (n=3), and meningitis (n=2). Molecular tests for enterovirus were positive in 10 patients. C-reactive protein values were significantly higher in neonates with bacterial infection than in those with enterovirus infection (62,3 versus 9mg/L, P=0,008). Two patients with Streptococcus agalactiae meningitis, 1 with Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and 3 with enterovirus infection (manifested as myocarditis, hepatitis, and meningoencephalitis) required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. Among these, 1 newborn with S. agalactiae and 2 of the 3 with enterovirus infection died. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, enterovirus infection was an important cause of severe invasive disease. Specific viral diagnosis can contribute to the management of febrile neonates.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR.
AB  - We aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis: report of 2 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis, a localized infection within the pericardial space, has become a rare entity in the modern antibiotic era. Although historically a disease of children and young adults, this is no longer the case: the median age at the time of diagnosis has increased by nearly 30 years over the past 6 decades. Despite advances in diagnostic and treatment modalities, purulent pericarditis remains a life-threatening illness. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is made postmortem in more than half the cases. Thus, a high index of clinical suspicion is crucial. We present 2 cases of purulent pericarditis, and provide an updated review of other case series published over the past 60 years.
TI  - Characterization and bacterial response of zinc oxide particles prepared by a biomineralization process.
AB  - In this paper, olive-like ZnO particles were successfully synthesized via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (SF) peptide at room temperature. The coat of SF peptide on the surface of ZnO particles had a substantial influence on their morphology during the biomineralization. Room-temperature photoluminescence behavior of ZnO particles indicated that the visible blue emission peak centered at 410 nm was enhanced with the mineralization time. Bacteriological tests revealed that the mineralized ZnO particles with SF peptide were not toxic for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae, presenting good cytocompatibility due to the surface coat of peptide. Their potential applications in bio-optical detectors could be envisioned.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials on major bacterial mastitis  pathogens in vitro.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials including trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol on major bacterial mastitis pathogens in milk. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the aforementioned compounds on Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli were determined. In addition, the bactericidal kinetics of TC on the aforementioned pathogens and the persistence of the antimicrobial activity of TC in milk over a period of 2 wk were investigated. All 4 plant-derived molecules exhibited antimicrobial activity against the 5 mastitis pathogens tested, but TC was most effective in killing the bacteria. The MIC and MBC of TC on Staph. aureus, E. coli, and Strep. uberis were 0.1 and 0.45%, respectively, whereas that on Strep. agalactiae and Strep. dysgalactiae were 0.05 and 0.4%, respectively. The MIC and MBC of the other 3 molecules ranged from 0.4 to 0.8% and 0.8 to 1.5%, respectively. In time-kill assays, TC at the MBC reduced the bacterial pathogens in milk by 4.0 to 5.0 log(10) cfu/mL and to undetectable levels within 12 and 24 h, respectively. The antimicrobial effect of TC persisted for the duration of the experiment (14 d) without any loss of activity. Results of this study suggest that TC has the potential to be evaluated as an alternative or adjunct to antibiotics as intramammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic hemolytic activities of bacteria of genus Arcanobacterium and CAMP-like hemolysis of Arcanobacterium phocae and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum with Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus.
AB  - A total of 57 bacteria representing eight species of genus Arcanobacterium (A.) were investigated for hemolytic properties on blood agar containing sheep and rabbit blood and for CAMP-like reactions. An enhanced hemolysis on blood agar containing rabbit blood compared to sheep blood could be observed for A. haemolyticum, less pronounced for A. hippocoleae and A. pluranimalium. A synergistic hemolytic reaction with staphylococcal beta-hemolysin appeared to be constantly visible for A. hippocoleae, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes, with Streptococcus agalactiae for A. phocae and A. haemolyticum, with Rhodococcus equi for A. phocae, A. haemolyticum, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes and with A. haemolyticum for A. hippocoleae, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes, respectively. A reverse CAMP-reaction in the zone of staphylococcal beta-hemolysin could be observed for A.phocae and A.haemolyticum. In addition, a novel CAMP-like reaction could be noted between Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, and A. phocae and A. haemolyticum. These synergistic or antagonistic hemolytic properties could possibly be used as additional criteria for identification of bacteria of genus Arcanobacterium.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Eight-plex PCR and liquid-array detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected meningitis.
AB  - We here report on the development of a novel multiplex PCR with product detection in a Luminex 100 suspension array system. The assay covers the nine most important bacterial and viral pathogens found in Danish meningitis patients. The microorganisms include Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and varicella-zoster virus. The study was based on 1,187 samples, of which 55 were found to be positive by PCR. The assay was found to have an excellent sensitivity and an excellent specificity compared to the results of a "gold standard," defined by routine laboratory tests, for the two most important pathogens, S. pneumoniae (95 and 99.1%, respectively) and N. meningitidis (100 and 99.7%, respectively). The method provides a valuable supplement to the traditional microscopy and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in a routine diagnostic setting, and results can be available within 1 workday. The method is suitable for use for the initial screening and identification of nine important microorganisms in CSF samples from patients with suspected meningitis. Compared to microscopy and culture of CSF, this rapid and sensitive method will support physicians with the selection of the appropriate antimicrobial agents and the initiation of timely treatment in the absence of live microorganisms in the CSF.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of the novel peptide CECT7121 against bacteria isolated from mastitic dairy cattle.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the novel antimicrobial peptide (AP) CECT7121 against Gram-positive bacteria from mastitic dairy cattle. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 15 Staphylococcus aureus, 10 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 7 Strep. uberis, 1 Strep. agalactiae strains were isolated from 33 different mastitic dairy cattle, sourced from two dairies in Tandil-Argentina. Isolates from each of the bacterial species screened which developed the lowest inhibition zones in response to the peptide, were further evaluated in a series of time-killing curve studies. No survivors were detected in whole strains (from the three Streptococcal species isolated) within 120 min of incubation in presence of the peptide. The Staph. aureus isolates were less sensitive but, nevertheless, a drop in viable counts to below the detection limit was achieved for all the test strains by the final postincubation sampling point at 180 min. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of the AP-CECT7121 against a variety strains of Gram positives isolated from mastitic dairy cattle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There is urgent global interest in the development of natural alternatives for the control and prevention of mastitis. Confirmation of the in vitro activity of the novel AP-CECT7121 against Gram-positive isolates encourages further research.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Prevalence of intramammary infection in Dutch dairy herds.
AB  - A survey was carried out in 2003 in 49 dairy herds to determine the overall and pathogen-specific prevalence of intramammary infection (IMI) in Dutch dairy herds, and to compare the distribution with four studies performed from 1973 to 1985 in The Netherlands. Herds were randomly selected stratified over the 12 Dutch provinces, had at least 40 lactating cows and participated in the Dutch milk recording system. Quarter milk samples were collected from all 408 cows with a somatic cell count (SCC) >or=250,000 cells/ml and 145 heifers with SCC >or=150,000 cells/ml at the last milk test before the farm visit. Additionally, samples were collected from 519 (approximately 25%) of the remaining low-SCC cows and heifers with a SCC at the last milk test before the farm visit of <250 000 and <150 000 cells/ml, respectively. Bacterial growth occurred in 37.3% of milk samples of high-SCC cows and in 21.1% of low-SCC cows. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most frequently isolated group of bacteria (10.8% of quarters) and were found in all herds. Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus IMI was lower in 2003 than in 1973, respectively 1.8% and 6.2% of quarters. Prevalence of Streptococcus uberis and Str. dysgalactiae IMI was almost the same in the five samplings during the 30-year period, at 1.1-1.7 and 0.9-1.5%, respectively. Str. agalactiae was not found in this study. Prevalence of CNS IMI was higher in lactating heifers, while prevalence of Str. uberis, Str. dysgalactiae and penicillin-resistant Staph. aureus IMI was higher in older cows. Because distribution of pathogens changes over time, herd-level samples for bacteriological culturing must be taken regularly to monitor udder health. Additionally, national mastitis prevalence studies give important information through monitoring the national udder health status.
TI  - Prevalence of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis in bulk tank milk in Mexico.
AB  - Mastitis as cause of low milk production coupled with the use of medication to control it cause dairy farms to register large economic losses. Microorganisms' prevalence, and somatic cell counts (SCCs) were determined in 112 Holstein bovine herds in two bulk tank milk-screening assays. Detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Mycoplasma spp. as microorganisms primarily responsible for clinical and subclinical mastitis and their relationship with SCCs was evaluated by Student's t-test and the kappa test. Prevalence of Mycoplasma was 55%; of S. aureus, 30%; of Streptococcus uberis, 37.5%; and of Staphylococcus coagulase-negative, 38.3%. The geometric mean of the SCC was 465,000 cells/mL. No significant differences were observed in the SCCs between the positive and negative samples of pathogens isolated (P > 0.5). There was a low kappa value of Mycoplasma correlation between samplings (kappa value = 0.10). This work aimed to understand the relationship between the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk and SCCs in bovine herds in the central part of Mexico.
TI  - Changing trends in mastitis.
AB  - The global dairy industry, the predominant pathogens causing mastitis, our understanding of mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. This paper aims to discuss changes in each of these aspects. Globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. In many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis and an increase in the relative impact of Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli mastitis. In some countries, Klebsiella spp. or Streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. Differences between countries in legislation, veterinary and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. For pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. For pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. The genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. Genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. These developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: SENTRY surveillance program, Spain (2002-2006)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. In this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered in 3 Spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international SENTRY antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The possible therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of Spanish susceptibility data. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. RESULTS: All the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. The highest MIC values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. In addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against Enterococcus faecalis. Daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. viridans group isolates. The distribution of daptomycin MIC values in S. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. CONCLUSION: The sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in Spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of udder pathogens from cases of acute clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - To investigate occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in udder pathogens MICs in Staphylococcus aureus (n=211), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n=56), Streptococcus uberis (n=113), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (n=152), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=6), Escherichia coli (n=163), and Klebsiella spp. (n=42) were determined using microdilution. Isolates were from a nation wide survey employing strict inclusion criteria. Presence of acquired resistance was evaluated by species-specific epidemiological cut-off values issued by EUCAST. Penicillin or methicillin resistance in staphylococci were however evaluated by beta-lactamase production or presence of the mecA gene, respectively. Staphylococci were mostly susceptible to antimicrobials tested but 7.1% of S. aureus and 12.5% of CNS were resistant to penicillin by beta-lactamase production. Methicillin resistance was not found in S. aureus. All Streptococcus dysgalactiae and S. agalactiae were susceptible to penicillin. Bimodal MIC distributions for tetracycline in S dysgalactiae and S. uberis indicate acquired resistance in some isolates. Among E. coli 12.3% of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Resistance to streptomycin (11.0%), sulphametoxazole (8.6%), ampicillin (7.4%), or tetracycline (4.9%) were the most common traits. Klebsiella spp. were resistant to ampicillin and some isolates also to tetracycline (7.1%) or sulphonamide (9.5%). The study shows that in Sweden bacteria associated with acute clinical mastitis for the most part are susceptible to antimicrobials used in therapy but resistance to penicillin in S. aureus is not uncommon. Penicillin is recommended for treatment of mastitis caused by gram-positive pathogens and regular monitoring of beta-lactamase production in S. aureus is therefore recommended in herds with udder health problems.
TI  - A survey of bacteriological quality and the occurrence of Salmonella in raw bovine colostrum.
AB  - In recent years, bovine colostrum has gained popularity as a human food because it is an excellent source of bioactive proteins, which have been claimed to inhibit viral and bacterial pathogens, improve gastrointestinal health, and enhance body condition. A study was conducted to determine bacteriological quality and occurrence of Salmonella in colostrum collected from dairy herds (n = 55) in Pennsylvania. Colostrum samples were analyzed for standard plate count, preliminary incubation count, laboratory pasteurization count, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and non-coliforms. A standardized polymerase chain reaction assay was used for detection of Salmonella in colostrum. Salmonella were detected in 8 of 55 (15%) of colostrum samples. Streptococcus agalactiae (1000 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) was detected in one colostrum sample. The mean standard plate count (977,539 CFU/mL), preliminary incubation count (12,094,755 CFU/mL), laboratory pasteurization count (615 CFU/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (306 CFU/mL), coagulase negative staphylococci (164,963 CFU/mL), streptococci (256,722 CFU/mL), coliforms (323,372 CFU/mL), and non-coliforms (111,544 CFU/mL) counts in colostrum were considerably higher than raw bulk tank milk counts reported previously from Pennsylvania. Analysis revealed that farm size did not influence the bacteriological quality of colostrum. Collection, handling, and storage of colostrum need to be addressed to improve bacteriological quality of colostrum intended not only for feeding calves but also for human consumption.
TI  - Udder shape and teat-end lesions as potential risk factors for high somatic cell  counts and intra-mammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - The association of common bacterial pathogens in milk samples during calving with udder shape or the presence of 'teat-end' lesions was investigated in 240 dairy cows from two herds. Sixty-three of 120 cows (53%) in one herd (herd A) and 54/120 animals (45%) in a second herd (herd B) had normal-shaped udders. The remaining animals had udder shapes defined as follows: large pendulous (18% herd A, 26% herd B); large between hindquarter (10% herd A, 17% herd B); overall small (8% herd A, 5% herd B); or small but pendulous (11% herd A, 7% herd B). At calving teat-end lesions were present in 63% and 76% of the quarters of herd A and B animals, respectively. There was no herd effect on udder shape or teat-end lesions. Analysis of variance revealed that udder shape and teat-end lesions did not have a significant association with quarter somatic cell count. However there was some association between mammary infection and udder shape and teat-end lesions. Compared to other udder shapes, cows with large between hindquarter shape had significantly less Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis infection (P<0.001). There was a similar albeit less significant negative association with Escherichia coli infection (P<0.01). Infection with Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae was more frequent in cows with large pendulous and overall small udder conformations. The results also suggest an association between intra-mammary infection at calving and the presence of hyperkeratotic teat-end lesions, given that S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. uberis, S. agalactiae and E. coli were cultured from significantly more quarters with such lesions than from quarters without lesions or with other types of lesion (P<0.001).
TI  - CNS mastitis: nothing to worry about?
AB  - In this paper, we analyzed a very large field data set on intramammary infections (IMI) and the associated somatic cell count (SCC) in dairy cows. The objective of the study was to analyze the impact of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) IMI on cow SCC, both mean and variability, and on the potential of these infections to have a major impact on the bulk milk SCC (BMSCC). Data and milk samples for bacterial culture were collected by Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) between 1992 and March of 2007. The QMPS program services dairy farms in New York State and other states in the Northeastern USA and operates in conjunction with Cornell University. Only records from cows where SCC and milk production data were available, and where only one organism was isolated from bacterial cultures of milk samples (or where culture was negative) were used for this analysis. A total of 352,614 records from 4200 whole herd mastitis screening sampling qualified for this study. Within herds an average of 15% (S.D. 12%) of cows sampled were infected with CNS, ranging between 0 and 100%. Average within herd prevalence of cows with a CNS IMI and an SCC over 200,000 cells/ml was 2% (S.D. 4%) with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 50%. Results of linear mixed models showed three distinct populations of IMI statuses: negative cultures with the lowest SCC; CNS and Corynebacterium bovis with a moderate increase in SCC, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus showing an important increase in SCC. Surprisingly, milk production was slightly but significantly higher in CNS infected cows compared to culture-negative cows, whereas it was strongly reduced in cows with a major pathogen IMI. The percentage contribution of CNS infections to the BMSCC was 17.9% in herds with a BMSCC less than 200,000 cells/ml. This value decreased to 11.9 and 7.9% in herds with bulk milk SCC between 200,000 and 400,000 and over 400,000 cells/ml, respectively. We concluded that very few herds with milk quality problems would have an important increase in BMSCC that could be mostly attributed to CNS infections. On the other hand, in herds with low BMSCC, CNS infections may be an important contributor to the total number of somatic cells in the bulk milk.
TI  - Deaths of early-onset, invasive sepsis in full-term infants in Miyazaki: nine cases from a regional population-based analysis from 1998-2006.
AB  - In a population-based study we investigated the early-onset, invasive sepsis caused by group B streptococcus (GBS) and non-GBS in the era of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. From 1998 to 2006, we had 387 perinatal deaths in 98,495 deliveries, and 9 full-term infants met the criteria of early-onset, invasive sepsis, in which microorganisms were proven from blood sampling. Of these cases, 4 involved GBS, 2 ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, 2 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was unidentified. All 4 cases of GBS related death underwent improper procedures contrary to the prophylaxis recommendation. Eighty percent of non-GBS related deaths had septicemia of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. We found in our population-based study that early-onset, fatal sepsis in full-term infants is associated with insufficient adherence to the prophylaxis strategy for GBS and with the emergence of antimicrobial resistant non-GBS bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - Proposed MIC and disk diffusion microbiological cutoffs and spectrum of activity  of retapamulin, a novel topical antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical isolates representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. MICs were determined along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. Population distribution and MIC versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to determine microbiological MIC cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key species. The retapamulin MIC(90) against 234 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. Retapamulin MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including 102 Streptococcus pyogenes, 103 Streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group C Streptococcus, and 71 group G Streptococcus isolates. The MIC(90) against 55 viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. Retapamulin had very little activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the Enterococcus species tested. Based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, MICs of <or=0.5, 1, and >or=2 microg/ml with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17 to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. For beta-hemolytic streptococci, a susceptible-only MIC of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be proposed for susceptible-only microbiological cutoffs.
TI  - Frequency of bacteria, Candida and malassezia species in balanoposthitis.
AB  - Balanoposthitis is an inflammatory disorder of the prepuce and glans penis. Microbes involved in balanoposthitis have been investigated, but no single study has covered the growth of both bacteria, Candida and Malassezia. We report here the prevalence of these microbes in 100 patients with balanoposthitis and in 26 control patients. Among patients with balanoposthitis there was a significantly higher frequency of positive cultures than in the control group (59% and 35%, respectively, p<0.05). In the balanoposthitis group Staphylococcus aureus was found in 19%, group B streptococci in 9%, Candida albicans in 18% and Malassezia in 23% of patients. In the control group S. aureus was not found at all, whereas C. albicans was found in 7.7% and Malassezia in 23% of patients. Different microbes did not correspond with distinct clinical manifestations. In summary, we report increased frequency of microbes, specifically S. aureus, in the area of the prepuce and glans penis in balanoposthitis.
TI  - Bacteriocin ST91KM, produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM produces a bacteriocin (macedocin ST91KM) active against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Macedocin ST91KM is, according to tricine-SDS PAGE, between 2.0 and 2.5 kDa in size. Antimicrobial activity remained unchanged after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-10.0 and after 100 min at 100 degrees C. The peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 degrees C and when treated with proteolytic enzymes. Treatment with alpha-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. Amplification of the genome of strain ST91KM with primers designed from the macedocin precursor gene (mcdA) produced 2 fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one 150-bp fragment, as recorded for macedocin produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Strain ACA-DC 198 was not available. However, DNA amplified from strain LMG 18488 (ACA-DC 206), genetically closely related to strain ACA-DC 198, revealed 99% homology to the mcdA of strain ACA-DC 198 (accession No. DQ835394). Macedocin ST91KM may thus be a second putative bacteriocin described for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus.
TI  - The response of HEK293 cells transfected with bovine TLR2 to established pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to bacteria causing mastitis in cattle.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Their role in immunity is difficult to examine in species of veterinary interest, due to restricted access to the knockout technology and TLR-specific antibodies. An alternative approach is to generate cell lines transfected with various TLRs and to examine the recognition of PAMPs or relevant bacteria. In this report, we examined whether recognition of various PAMPs and mastitis-causing bacteria is achieved by transfection of recombinant bovine TLR2 (boTLR2). Therefore, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected by whole boTLR2. A clonal analysis of stably transfected cells disclosed variable recognition of several putative TLR2 agonists although expressing similar amounts of the transgene and endogenous TLR6. One clone (clone 25) reacted by copious interleukin-8 (IL-8) production to several stimulants of TLR2 such as di-palmitoylated cysteyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lysine (Pam2), a biochemical preparation of lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus, a commercial preparation of peptidoglycan from S. aureus, and heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM). TLR2-dependent induction of IL-8 release was stronger in medium containing human serum albumin than in medium containing fetal calf serum. Clone 25 cells responded to high concentrations of S. aureus and to Escherichia coli causing mastitis, but not to Streptococcus uberis and to Streptococcus agalactiae which also cause mastitis. Stimulation by S. aureus was relatively weak when compared (i) with stimulation of the same cells by HKLM and PAMPs derived from S. aureus, (ii) with a clone stably transfected with TLR4 and MD-2 and stimulated by E. coli causing mastitis, and (iii) with interferon-gamma-costimulated bovine macrophages stimulated by S. aureus and S. agalactiae. Thus, clone 25 is suitable for studying the interaction of putative TLR2 agonists with bovine TLR2-transfected cells, provides a cell to search for TLR2-specific antibodies, and is a tool for studying the interaction of TLR2 with bacteria causing disease, e.g. mastitis, in cattle.
TI  - Development of a novel biochip for rapid multiplex detection of seven mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk samples.
AB  - To efficiently prevent and treat bovine mastitis and minimize its effect on the dairy industry, a sensitive, rapid, and specific test is required for identifying the mastitis-causing pathogens. In this study, a biochip capable of detecting 7 common species of mastitis-causing pathogens, including Corynebacterium bovis, Mycoplasma bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Streptococcus spp. S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. dysgalactiae, and S. uberis, within 6 hr was developed. The technique is based on DNA amplification of genes specific to the target pathogens and consists of 4 basic steps: DNA extraction of bacteria, polymerase chain reaction, DNA hybridization, and colorimetric reaction. To examine the accuracy and specificity of this biochip, a preliminary test with 82 random quarter milk samples were analyzed and compared with results from conventional microbiological methods conducted simultaneously. Results from all but 1 sample analyzed by the biochip were in agreement with those analyzed by bacteriology. The biochip could be a feasible tool for rapidly diagnosing mastitis-causing pathogens in milk and providing information for a more effective treatment to cure mastitis.
TI  - Serum procalcitonin for discrimination between septic and non-septic arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early differentiation between septic and non-septic arthritis is difficult. A previous study showed promising diagnostic accuracy of serum Procalcitonin (PCT) in septic arthritis, limited by a low sensitive PCT test kit. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of PCT in patients with septic and non-septic arthritis using a novel test with low detection limit. METHODS: Forty-two patients, 28 with non-septic and 14 with septic arthritis were prospectively included. For each patient, gram stain, culture and polarization microscopy of synovial fluid was done and PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, uric acid and blood cultures were taken. Patients with septic arthritis, patients with non-septic arthritis with and without concomitant infection were compared. RESULTS: Patients with septic arthritis had a significant higher PCT concentration than patients with non-septic arthritis (p<0.0001). At a cut-off of 0.1 (0.25) ng/ml, sensitivity for septic arthritis was 100(93)% and specificity 46(75)%. Specificity rose to 93% after exclusion of patients with non-septic arthritis and concomitant infection. Both sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of septic arthritis were higher for PCT than CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PCT seems to be a highly sensitive and specific marker for septic arthritis, depending on the clinical setting. Further studies are warranted.
TI  - Bovine mastitis and antibiotic resistance patterns in Selalle smallholder dairy farms, central Ethiopia.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of mastitis, identify the major bacterial pathogens and test the antimicrobial resistance of milk bacterial isolates in smallholder dairy farms in Selalle area, Ethiopia. A total of 109 smallholder dairy farms comprising 500 crossbred lactating cows were included. The prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd, cow and quarter level was 8.3% (n=9), 1.8% (n=9) and 0.51% (n=10), respectively, while that of sub-clinical mastitis was 54.7%, 22.3% and 10.1%, respectively. The univariate logistic regression showed that among the risk factors considered, presence of teat lesion, stage of lactation and parity number had significant effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. However, after multivariate analysis, only presence of teat lesion and stage of lactation had significant effect. The common isolates from the clinical mastitic quarters were St. agalactiae (30%, n=3) and St. dysgalactiae (30%, n=3), while from sub-clinical cases were S. aureus (42.6%, n=83), S. epidermidis (22.1%, n=43), St. agalactiae (12.8%, n=25) and St. uberis (10.3%, n=20). Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were the species, which showed high level of susceptibility for most of the antimicrobials tested, while the remaining had varying levels of resistance for almost all the antimicrobials used. Among the antimicrobials employed, erythromycin and sulphonamide showed the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. Considering the possible significant economic losses that could be incurred by both clinical and sub-clinical mastitis, attention should be paid for further detailed investigations including the economic losses and benefits of interventions in the study area.
TI  - The generation of nisin variants with enhanced activity against specific gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Nisin is the prototype of the lantibiotic group of antimicrobial peptides. It exhibits broad spectrum inhibition of gram-positive bacteria including important food pathogens and clinically relevant antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Significantly, the gene-encoded nature of nisin means that it can be subjected to gene-based bioengineering to generate novel derivatives. Here, we take advantage of this to generate the largest bank of randomly mutated nisin derivatives reported to date, with the ultimate aim of identifying variants with enhanced bioactivity. This approach led to the identification of a nisin-producing strain with enhanced bioactivity against the mastitic pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae resulting from an amino acid change in the hinge region of the peptide (K22T). Prompted by this discovery, site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis of the hinge region residues was employed, resulting in the identification of additional derivatives, most notably N20P, M21V and K22S, with enhanced bioactivity and specific activity against gram-positive pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes and/or Staphylococcus aureus. The identification of these derivatives represents a major step forward in the bioengineering of nisin, and lantibiotics in general, and confirms that peptide engineering can deliver derivatives with enhanced antimicrobial activity against specific problematic spoilage and pathogenic microbes or against gram-positive bacteria in general.
TI  - Acute coliform mastitis in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis): clinical findings and treatment outcomes.
AB  - This report was delineated to study the clinical, bacteriological and therapeutic aspects concerned with acute coliform mastitis in buffaloes. Bacteriological examination of 80 quarter milk samples obtained aseptically from 56 buffaloes with acute mastitis revealed that coliform bacteria was the most common pathogen (45 cases) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (seven cases) then Streptococcus uberis (three cases), and Streptococcus agalactiae (one case). Clinically, hotness, swelling and painful reaction with serous excretion containing clots was recorded in buffaloes with coliform mastitis. The efficacy of ceftiofur was evaluated in the treatment of buffaloes with acute coliform mastitis. Parenteral ceftiofur neither improved clinical signs nor returned milk to pre-infection production level, whereas intramammary ceftiofur and combination of intramammary with parenteral ceftiofur improved the clinical signs in 10/15 and 12/15 buffaloes, respectively. On quarter level, 3/17, 12/17 and 15/21 quarters recovered in groups received parenteral, intramammary and combination therapy, respectively. This study demonstrates that systemic ceftofur is not effective in the treatment of clinical coliform mastitis in buffaloes.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Treatment challenges in the management of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections.
AB  - Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) are a significant clinical problem, partially owing to increasing resistance of infecting bacteria to current antibiotic therapies. Two case studies that illustrate complications that can arise when treating cSSTIs are outlined, and methods that can be used to address the problem and the final treatment outcome are detailed. Although these are specific examples, intolerance of and bacterial resistance to current antibacterial therapies are problems that are often seen in the clinical setting and must be addressed appropriately. The use of new antibiotic agents is one potential solution to these problems, and some of these agents are highlighted. Selecting the most appropriate therapy for an infection is often crucial for patient welfare. This article presents some potential approaches to the treatment of cSSTIs.
TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae myositis in a child with perinatally acquired human immnodeficiency virus.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a musculoskeletal infection with formation of an intramuscular abscess. Endemic in tropical climates, it is being reported with increasing frequency in temperate climates such as the United States. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus, present in greater than 90% of reported cases. Risk factors include underlying chronic illness, malnutrition, immunocompromised state, and muscle trauma. We present a case in which Streptococcus agalactae was the causative agent of myositis in a child with a history of perinatally derived human immunodeficiency virus infection.
TI  - Toxicological effect of ZnO nanoparticles based on bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are two pathogenetic agents of several infective diseases in humans. Biocidal effects and cellular internalization of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) on two bacteria are reported, and ZnO NPs have a good bacteriostasis effect. ZnO NPs were synthesized in the EG aqueous system through the hydrolysis of ionic Zn2+ salts. Particle size and shape were controlled by the addition of the various surfactants. Bactericidal tests were performed in an ordinary broth medium on solid agar plates and in liquid systems with different concentrations of ZnO NPs. The biocidal action of ZnO materials was studied by transmission electron microscopy of bacteria ultrathin sections. The results confirmed that bactericidal cells were damaged after ZnO NPs contacted with them, showing both gram-negative membrane and gram-positive membrane disorganization. The surface modification of ZnO NPs causes an increase in membrane permeability and the cellular internalization of these NPs whereas there is a ZnO NP structure change inside the cells.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of heyneanol A extracted from the root of Taiwanese wild grape.
AB  - AIMS: To search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (Vitis spp.). To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against Gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. After purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol A by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Heyneanol A showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards MRSA and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the contents of heyneanol A were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. CONCLUSIONS: The root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of Gram-positive pathogens. Heyneanol A, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards MRSA. In addition, the abundances of heyneanol A and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. The results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against MRSA.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Integrin beta 1 regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through Rac expression.
AB  - Phagocytosis and subsequent phagosome maturation by professional phagocytes are essential in the clearance of infectious microbial pathogens. The molecular regulation of phagosome maturation is largely unknown. We show that integrin beta(1) plays critical roles in the phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and phagosome maturation. Macrophages lacking integrin beta(1) expression exhibit reduced phagocytosis of bacteria, including group B streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, phagosomes from macrophages lacking integrin beta(1) show lowered maturation rate, defective acquisition of lysosome membrane markers, and reduced F-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. Integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages exhibit impaired bactericidal activity. We found that the expression of the Rho family GTPases Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 was reduced in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages. Ectopic expression of Rac1, but not Cdc42, in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages restored defective phagosome maturation and F-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. Importantly, macrophages lacking Rac1/2 also exhibit defective maturation of phagosomes derived from opsonized Escherichia coli or IgG beads. Taken together, these results suggest that integrin beta(1) regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through Rac expression.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (Ply700) from Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. A prophage was isolated from a strain of Streptococcus uberis (ATCC 700407) following exposure to mitomycin C. Partial sequencing of the phage DNA revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. The putative lysin (Ply700) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. Addition of the purified Ply700 to bacterial suspensions of S. uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, or E. coli. Killing of S. uberis in milk by Ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. Activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (P<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (P<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. In contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. Functional characterization of the C-terminal domain, as a component of a GFP fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to S. uberis. The C-terminal domain may have utility in targeting S. uberis while it remains to be determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of S. uberis mastitis.
TI  - Inactivation of bacterial pathogens in human milk by high-pressure processing.
AB  - Low-temperature, long-time (LTLT) pasteurization assures the safety of banked human milk; however, heat can destroy important nutritional biomolecules. High-pressure processing (HPP) shows promise as an alternative for pasteurization of breast milk. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of HPP for inactivation of selected bacterial pathogens in human milk. Human milk was inoculated with one of five pathogens (10(8) to 10(9) CFU/ml), while 0.1% peptone solution solutions with the same levels of each organism were used as controls. The samples were subjected to 400 MPa at 21 to 31 degrees C for 0 to 50 min or to 62.5 degrees C for 0 to 30 min (capillary tube method) to simulate LTLT pasteurization. Tryptic soy agar and selective media were used for enumeration. Traditional thermal pasteurization resulted in inactivation (> 7 log) of all pathogens within 10 min. In human milk and in peptone solution, a 6-log reduction was achieved after 30 min of HPP for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. After 30 min, S. aureus ATCC 25923 was reduced by 8 log and 6 log in human milk and peptone solution, respectively. Treatments of 4 and 7 min resulted in an 8-log inactivation of Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 12927 in human milk and peptone solution, respectively, while Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 required 2 min for an 8-log inactivation in human milk. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was inactivated by 8 log after 10 min in peptone solution and by 6 log after 30 min in human milk. These data suggest that HPP may be a promising alternative for pasteurization of human milk. Further research should evaluate the efficacy of HPP in the inactivation of relevant viral pathogens.
TI  - Secular trends in pediatric bloodstream infections over a 20-year period at a tertiary care hospital in Germany.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Over the last 20 years, a number of medical innovations with impact on the incidence of bacterial and fungal bloodstream infections (BSIs) in children have been developed and implemented. Although appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is a prerequisite to the successful treatment of BSIs, to date, epidemiological data on long-term microbiological trends in BSIs of hospitalized children have not been available. METHODS: Two cohorts of pediatric patients who were hospitalized in a single-center tertiary care hospital in Germany over a 20-year time span (period A from 1985 to 1995 vs. period B from 1997 to 2006) were retrospectively analyzed and compared with respect to the epidemiology and microbiology of BSIs. RESULTS: A total of 1,646 cases of monomicrobial BSIs were detected. The rate of positive blood culture results dropped from 4.5% in period A to 2.0% in period B. The proportion of gram-positive vs. gram-negative pathogens recovered from blood cultures remained stable. Among gram-positive pathogens, an increase in enterococci (3.3% vs. 8.2%) and in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (22.9 vs. 28.2%) was observed. In contrast, BSIs caused by Staphylococcus aureus (16.4% vs. 11.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.9% vs. 2.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.3% vs. 0.7%), and Neisseria meningitidis (1.9% vs. 0.5%) diminished. In analyzing subgroups, an increase of enterococcal and CoNS infections was noted among patients with immunosuppression and neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS), while a decrease was found among late-onset sepsis (LOS) cases with S. viridans. Notably, aminopenicillin-resistant enterococci and aminopenicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae all increased over time, while the overall resistance pattern was still favorable. The overall mortality rate of BSIs decreased (5.2% vs. 2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Over the 20-year study period, the spectrum of specific microorganisms among BSIs shifted, with opportunistic pathogens becoming predominant. Despite an increase in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant organisms, however, the mortality rate decreased.
TI  - Genital tract methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: risk of vertical transmission in pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency of genital tract colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among pregnant women and evaluate the association of such colonization with infant outcome. METHODS: Between July 2003 and July 2006, anovaginal screening cultures for group B Streptococcus (GBS) were prospectively obtained in the third trimester (35 to less than 37 weeks of gestation) and were also processed for identification of Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains. Maternal colonization by MRSA was linked to a computerized database of invasive neonatal infections that occurred at our center during the study period. RESULTS: Among 5,732 mothers (who delivered 5,804 infants) with GBS screening cultures and infant infection data available, 22.9% were GBS-positive and 14.5% were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 24.3% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were MRSA. The overall MRSA colonization rate was 3.5%. Colonization by any Staphylococcus aureus (relative risk 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.9) as well as MRSA (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.6-2.8) was significantly more common among GBS-positive than among GBS-negative women. No cases of early-onset invasive neonatal infection by MRSA occurred among infants in the study. CONCLUSION: Genital tract colonization with MRSA affected 3.5% of pregnant women. Such MRSA colonization is associated with colonization by GBS but does not predispose to a high risk of early-onset neonatal MRSA infection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.
TI  - Reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  - The evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. Extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. In many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. It has recently been suggested that serum procalcitonin (PCT) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. This study was designed to determine the reliability of PCT concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values. The current study included 69 newborn babies. After full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: Group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. They had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. The second group: Group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified into twosubgroups: group 2A; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2B included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood culture. Blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and blood chemistry, additionally, CRP, serum IL-6 and PCT were measured. The microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2A; Escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group B streptococci (GBS) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was GBS positive mother. The comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (WBCs) and CRP levels were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. While in group 2B the WBCs not differed from group 1 but CRP differed from group 1. IL-6 and PCT values were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. Furthermore in group 2B both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. For the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, PCT give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.7%. At a cutoff >140 ng/ml, IL-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, speCificity of 70.4%, PPV of 64%, NPV of 63.3%. However, at a cutoff >12 mg/L, CRP gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, PPV of 77.1%, NPV of 70%. We conclude that the serum PCT concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study (part of the global TEST program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in Italy was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the CLSI in 2005. RESULTS: Globally, 135 Gram-negative and 65 Gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. Tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC(90) <or=1 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. These data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - The application of chromogenic media in clinical microbiology.
AB  - Since 1990, a wide range of chromogenic culture media has been made commercially  available providing useful tools for diagnostic clinical microbiology. By the inclusion of chromogenic enzyme substrates targeting microbial enzymes, such media are able to target pathogens with high specificity. Examples of target pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella spp. and Candida spp. The inclusion of multiple chromogenic substrates into culture media facilitates the differentiation of polymicrobial cultures, thus allowing for the development of improved media for diagnosis of urinary tract infections and media for the enhanced discrimination of yeasts. The purpose of this review is to provide some insight into how such media work and appraise their utility in routine clinical diagnostics, in comparison with conventional media.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Prevalence of mastitis pathogens in Ragusa, Sicily, from 2000 to 2006.
AB  - The objective of this study was to report the prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) in Ragusa, Sicily, from milk samples (n = 18,711) collected between October 2000 and June 2006 from 101 dairy herds. Milk samples were collected at 9,747 cow sampling events from 5,285 individual cows. Samples were individual quarter (92.8%) or composite samples (7.2%) from an individual cow. Logistic regression was used to examine the prevalence of IMI at the level of milk sample and at the level of cow, controlling for year and season of collection, type of sample (individual quarter or composite), and type of housing and bedding of the cow at the time of collection. Bedding and housing types were as follows, respectively (number of herd groups): bedding: none (61), organic [51 (straw, 50; sawdust, 1)], and sand (3); housing: bedded pack (37), free stalls (57), tie stalls (4), and paddock (17). Raw prevalence of cow IMI for a sample event was as follows (percentage of cow samples): no growth, 47.4%; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 22.6%; Staphylococcus aureus, 20.6%; other Streptococcus spp., 11.1%; Streptococcus agalactiae, 2.3%; coliform bacteria, 2.9%; and other organisms, 5.8%. Prevalence of IMI differed by bedding type for Staph. aureus (none, 24.5%; organic, 12.7%; sand, 12.3%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (none, 13.1%; organic, 27.4%; sand, 26.9%) but not for Streptococcus spp. or coliform bacteria. Prevalence of Streptococcus spp. IMI differed by housing type (tie stalls, 22.2%; bedded pack, 12.8%; free stalls, 8.4%; paddock, 7.1%). Housing was not associated with the prevalence of IMI for other bacteria. Herd monthly prevalence of Staph. aureus and Streptococcus spp. IMI was associated with decreased mean milk production (Staph. aureus, -1.42 kg/d per cow, SEM 0.51; Streptococcus spp., -1.31 kg/d per cow, SEM 0.64) and increased mean linear score (Staph. aureus, 1.01 units/d per cow, SEM 0.16; Streptococcus spp., 0.59 units/d per cow, SEM 0.22). Herds (n = 11) with a mean linear score (MLS) less than 3.3 units had the lowest prevalence of Staph. aureus IMI and monthly MLS and the greatest monthly mean milk production compared with other herds grouped by MLS [MLS 3.31 to 3.99 (n = 20), MLS 4.00 to 4.46 (n = 20), MLS >4.46 (n = 17), and MLS not available (n = 33)]. Implementation of a milk quality program to control gram-positive organisms is important for Ragusa.
TI  - [Neonatal infections of the bones and joints].
AB  - Neonatal osteoarticular infections remain rare, with an estimated incidence of 1  to 3 cases per 1000 admissions to Neonatal Intensive Care Units. It usually results from bacteraemia and may thus be induced by IV catheters. More rarely it is due to direct inoculation secondary to cutaneous damage, or extension of soft tissue infection. The particularity of bone vascularization in the newborn explains the frequency of abscess formation in the periosteum or in soft tissues. The main pathogen involved is S. aureus (3/4 of cases), followed by group B streptococci and enterobacteriacae. Infection consists mainly of localised and slowly progressing abscesses. However, multifocal and severe infection is possible, in particular when caused by an IV catheter. Ultrasonography is the best initial investigation, possibly leading to surgical care. Medical treatment must include 2 synergistic antistaphyloccocal antibiotics, possibly associated with cefotaxime. The outcome is generally favorable, but orthopaedic consequences may emerge if the growth plate is involved. Rare specific causes, such as syphilis or tuberculosis, should also be evoked, but the clinical context is generally helpful for the diagnosis.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - Prevalence and distribution of mastitis pathogens in subclinically infected dairy cows in Flanders, Belgium.
AB  - The main objective was to determine the prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows in Flanders, Belgium. Data were obtained from quarter milk samples of dairy herds subjected to a mandatory yearly screening of all lactating cows. A total of 178,668 quarter milk samples were collected at 1087 cross-sectional dairy herd screenings performed in three consecutive years. Of the dairy cows, 40% had at least one culture-positive quarter. More than 50% of all IMI were caused by non-aureus staphylococci. Streptococcus agalactiae is almost eradicated in Flanders, whereas Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 18% of the culture-positive quarters. In addition, the distribution of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples from selected dairy cows with an elevated somatic cell count (SCC) is described. From 6390 cows with a geometric mean composite SCC 250,000 cells/ml, nearly 65% had at least one culture-positive quarter. The majority of the IMI were caused by non-aureus staphylococci (41.1%), whereas Staph. aureus and aesculin-positive cocci were found in respectively 25% and 18% of the culture-positive milk samples. We conclude that more efforts are needed in the prevention and control of subclinical mastitis in Flanders. Non-aureus staphylococci are the predominant cause of IMI, warranting more research regarding the epidemiology and pathogenicity of those species.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 prophage lysins of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Putative N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase genes from LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 prophages of Streptococcus agalactiae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes lysed the cell walls of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptidoglycan digestion products in the cell wall lysates were not consistent with amidase activity. Instead, the structure of the muropeptide digestion fragments indicated that both the LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 lysins exhibited gamma-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity. The endopeptidase cleavage specificity of the lysins was confirmed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to a portion of the stem peptide and cross bridge of Streptococcus agalactiae peptidoglycan. The LambdaSa2 lysin also displayed beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity.
TI  - CAMP factor is not essential for systemic virulence of Group B Streptococcus.
AB  - The Gram-positive pathogen Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in human newborns. GBS elaborates a pore-forming toxin known as CAMP factor that synergizes with Staphylococcus aureus beta-toxin, generating a co-hemolytic reaction useful in identification of GBS in the clinical laboratory. To evaluate the indirect evidence implicating CAMP factor in GBS pathogenesis, the cfb gene encoding the pore-forming cytotoxin was deleted by precise allelic replacement. The virulence properties of the CAMP factor mutant were then explored by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. Compared to wild-type, the isogenic GBS Deltacfb mutant demonstrated equivalent phagocyte resistance and endothelial cell invasiveness and also retained full virulence in a mouse model of infection. Our data suggest that CAMP factor expressed in its native context is not essential for systemic virulence of GBS.
TI  - Fibrinogen-binding proteins of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Fibrinogen (Fg), the major clotting protein in blood plasma, plays key roles in blood coagulation and thrombosis. In addition, this 340 kD glycoprotein is a stress inducible protein; its synthesis is dramatically upregulated during inflammation or under exposure to stress such systemic infections. This regulation of Fg expression indicates that Fg also participates in the host defense system against infections. In fact, a number of reported studies have demonstrated the involvement of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation; the thrombotic and the fibrinolytic systems in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases. It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that many pathogenic bacteria can interact with Fg and manipulate its biology. This review focuses on the major Fg-binding proteins (Fgbps) from Gram-positive bacteria with an emphasis on those that are known to have an effect on coagulation and thrombosis.
TI  - Activity of staphylococcal bacteriocins against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  - The inhibitory activity of seven bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus (aureocins A70, A53, and 215FN) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Pep5, epidermin, epilancin K7 and epicidin 280) was tested against strains of both S. aureus (165 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (74 strains) isolated from udders of cows suffering from bovine mastitis. Most strains of the two species were inhibited by epidermin (>85%), aureocin A53 (>67%) and by a combination of aureocins A70 and A53 (>91%), co-expressed in the genetic background of strain A70, the native producer of aureocin A70. Synergy between aureocins A70 and A53 was also demonstrated, which broadened the spectrum of strains inhibited. The remaining staphylococcins inhibited either none of, or a lower percentage (<48%) of, the mastitis-causing pathogens tested. Our results therefore show that the use of epidermin and/or a combination of aureocins A53 and A70 may represent a new non-antibiotic alternative for successfully inhibiting both mastitic staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - An IgG-like domain in the minor pilin GBS52 of Streptococcus agalactiae mediates  lung epithelial cell adhesion.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, and  meningitis. The pathogen assembles heterotrimeric pilus structures on its surface; however, their function in pathogenesis is poorly understood. We report here the crystal structure of the pilin GBS52, which reveals two IgG-like fold domains, N1 and N2. Each domain is comprised of seven antiparallel beta strands, an arrangement similar to the fold observed in the Staphylococcus aureus adhesin Cna. Consistent with its role as an adhesin, deletion of gbs52 gene significantly reduces bacterial adherence to pulmonary epithelial cells. Moreover, latex beads linked to the GBS52 protein adhere to pulmonary but not to many other epithelial cells; binding to the former is specifically inhibited by antibodies against GBS52. Nonetheless, substantial binding is only observed with N2 domain-conjugated beads. This study presents the structure of a Gram-positive pilin that utilizes a distinct IgG fold variant to mediate pathogen adherence to a specific tissue.
TI  - Phase 2 study of ceftaroline versus standard therapy in treatment of complicated  skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bioactive metabolite of ceftaroline fosamil (previously PPI-0903, TAK-599), is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with potent in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive aerobic pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A randomized, observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline versus standard therapy in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) was performed. Adults with cSSSI, including at least one systemic marker of inflammation, were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (i.v.) ceftaroline (600 mg every 12 h) or i.v. vancomycin (1 g every 12 h) with or without adjunctive i.v. aztreonam (1 g every 8 h) for 7 to 14 days. The primary outcome measure was the clinical cure rate at a test-of-cure (TOC) visit 8 to 14 days after treatment. Secondary outcomes included the microbiological success rate (eradication or presumed eradication) at TOC and the clinical relapse rate 21 to 28 days following treatment. Of 100 subjects enrolled, 88 were clinically evaluable; the clinical cure rate was 96.7% (59/61) for ceftaroline versus 88.9% (24/27) for standard therapy. Among the microbiologically evaluable subjects (i.e., clinically evaluable and having had at least one susceptible pathogen isolated at baseline), the microbiological success rate was 95.2% (40/42) for ceftaroline versus 85.7% (18/21) for standard therapy. Relapse occurred in one subject in each group (ceftaroline, 1.8%; standard therapy, 4.3%). Ceftaroline exhibited a very favorable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with that of marketed cephalosporins. Most adverse events from ceftaroline were mild and not related to treatment. Ceftaroline holds promise as a new therapy for treatment of cSSSI and other serious polymicrobial infections.
TI  - [Acute neonatal parotitis due to Streptococcus agalactiae].
AB  - We report two cases of group B streptococcal acute neonatal parotitis. Both patients showed late-onset infections in association with acute parotid swelling, without cellulitis or purulent drainage from Stensen's duct. Neither of the infants had meningitis, and Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from blood cultures. Differential diagnosis with cellulitis-adenitis syndrome was based on clinical manifestations with supporting radiographic findings, which revealed parotid swelling with increased vascularization. Both infants were treated with a 2-week-course of intravenous cefotaxime, with complete recovery. Although the most common cause of acute neonatal bacterial parotitis is Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae should be included in the differential diagnosis, especially in infants with late-onset sepsis.
TI  - Group B streptococcal infections in the postgenomic era.
AB  - Dr Rubens is a pediatric infectious disease specialist and microbiologist, with a longstanding interest in the molecular pathogenesis of bacterial perinatal infections by Gram-positive bacteria. Group B streptococci (GBS) have been shown to invade eukaryotic cells and this process may be the main mechanism used by the organism to cause disease in neonates. Molecular approaches are used to identify the genetic and biochemical basis of specific virulence traits, such as epithelial/endothelial cell entry and transcytosis, evasion of innate immune mechanisms by inhibiting complement activation and phagocytic uptake, and microbial survival in various host environments (bloodstream, reproductive system and neonatal lung). Hence, these projects apply to both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Genetic techniques are also utilized to identify the genes and biosynthetic mechanisms important for the production of capsular polysaccharide and other virulence traits by GBS. Recently, Dr Rubens's group has started a project characterizing the early stages of bacterial pneumonia by investigating the host:pathogen interaction after introducing Staphylococcus aureus into the airway using genomic and proteomic techniques. This project will eventually characterize the bacterial response to the lung airway, including specific traits critical for microbial persistence in the face of lung innate immunity. They have also begun to characterize the host airway proteome for the proteins that contribute to innate immune mechanisms.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Efficacy of nisin in treatment of clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - Nisin is an antimicrobial polypeptide produced by Lactococcus lactis and is believed nontoxic to humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate a nisin-based formulation for the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cattle. A total of 92 cows with 107 clinically mastitic quarters were randomly assigned to nisin- (48 cows with 51 quarters) and gentamicin (GM)-treated (44 cows with 56 quarters) groups. In the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 IU; in the GM-treated group, intramammary infusion of GM was administered at a dose of 0.8 g. Results indicated that nisin offered a clinical cure rate similar to GM (90.2 vs. 91.1%) and no difference in bacteriological cure rate than GM-treated group (60.8 vs. 44.6%, respectively). Proportion of the quarters with milk somatic cell counts <500,000 cells/mL was not different in the nisin-treated group (50.0 and 47.8%) compared with the GM-treated group (33.3 and 37.3%) 1 and 2 wk after treatment. Of 17 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 82.5% were resistant to penicillin, and 35.3% to GM, but none of them to nisin. Nisin therapy eliminated 54.5% (6 of 11) of S. aureus IMI, whereas GM eliminated 33.3% (2 of 6). Nisin in milk (4.5 +/- 0.8 IU/mL) was detected only at 12 h following intramammary infusion, which was much lower than the upper limit (500 mg/mL) allowed as preservative in milk by the China authority. Because of its efficacy in the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis, especially resistant Staph. aureus-caused IMI, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different mastitis pathogens on a larger scale.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates recently  obtained in Europe.
AB  - The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
TI  - Therapeutic effect of nisin Z on subclinical mastitis in lactating cows.
AB  - Bovine subclinical mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland caused by bacterial intramammary infection, accounting for large economic losses. Treatment of subclinical mastitis is not suggested for lactating cows due to the risk of milk contamination. The objectives of this study were to evaluate an antimicrobial peptide, nisin, in the treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating cows. A total of 90 lactating Holstein cows with subclinical mastitis were randomly divided into nisin-treated (n = 46) and control (n = 44) groups. In the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 IU once daily for 3 days while the control cows received no treatment. Milk samples were collected from the affected mammary quarters before treatment and 1 and 2 weeks after treatment for analyses of bacteria, somatic cells, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase). Results indicated that nisin therapy had bacteriological cure rates of 90.1% for Streptococcus agalactiae (10 of 11), 50% for Staphylococcus aureus (7 of 14), 58.8% for coagulase-negative staphylococci (7 of 17), and 65.2% for all cases (30 of 46). Meanwhile, only 15.9% (7 of 44) of untreated cows spontaneously recovered. NAGase activity in milk samples and the number of mammary quarters with a milk somatic cell count of > or =500,000/ml were significantly decreased after nisin treatment while no significant changes took place in the control group. Because of its therapeutic effects on bovine subclinical mastitis, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different pathogens.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extract, fractions and four compounds extracted from Piper solmsianum C. DC. VAR. solmsianum (Piperaceae).
AB  - Piper solmsianum C. DC. var. solmsianum (Piperaceae) is a shrub commonly found in areas with wet tropical soils. Other Piper species have been used in folk medicine as antitumoral and antiseptic agents. We studied the crude methanolic extract, some organic fractions and compounds isolated from this plant for possible antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The bioautographic assays disclosed three inhibition zones. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined showing excellent activity, particularly against the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae). It appears that the antimicrobial activity of Piper solmsianum is related mainly to the presence of conocarpan and eupomatenoid-5 (neolignans). However another, as yet unidentified, active compound could also be extracted from the plant.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - A comparison of the activity of tigecycline against multiresistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - We evaluated the activity of several antibiotics against 225 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 252 isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae. Only tigecycline, glycopeptides, and linezolid were active against all the isolates of S. aureus, whereas the beta-lactams were also active against S. agalactiae. Tigecycline could be a good alternative to ampicillin in the treatment of group B Streptococcus infections in patients allergic to beta-lactam.
TI  - Group B streptococcus toxic shock-like syndrome in a healthy woman: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. The disease entity manifests clinically as fever, hypotension, diffuse macular erythema that progresses to desquamation, and dysfunction of > 3 organ systems. Toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) has the same clinical manifestation as TSS but is caused by Streptococcus, usually group A, C or G. Here we report on a healthy woman who experienced group B Streptococcus (GBS)-related TSLS, possibly related to tampon use. CASE: A 37-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, met the diagnostic criteria for TSS/TSLS 5 days after her last tampon use. Blood, urine and vaginal cultures were positive only for GBS. Analysis of the blood isolate suggested a novel GBS superantigen. CONCLUSION: This is the second reported case of GBS causing tampon-associated TSS/TSLS. Up to 40% of healthy menstruating women are vaginally colonized with GBS. Superantigens elaborated by staphylococci and streptococci induce an immunologic mediator storm that affects the circulatory and end-organ systems to produce the clinical picture. Prompt medical therapy involves large-volume isotonic fluid resuscitation and antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam. Clindamycin may dampen the immunologic response and endotoxin production. Corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin may be useful adjuncts; however, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories should be avoided.
TI  - Differential regulation of lipopolysaccharide and Gram-positive bacteria induced  cytokine and chemokine production in macrophages by Galpha(i) proteins.
AB  - Heterotrimeric G(i) proteins play a role in signalling activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and group B streptococci (GBS), leading to production of inflammatory mediators. We hypothesized that genetic deletion of G(i) proteins would alter cytokine and chemokine production induced by LPS, SA and GBS stimulation. LPS-induced, heat-killed SA-induced and heat-killed GBS-induced cytokine and chemokine production in peritoneal macrophages from wild-type (WT), Galpha(i2) (-/-) or Galpha(i1/3) (-/-) mice were investigated. LPS induced production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10 and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10); SA induced TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta production; and GBS induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and keratinocyte chemoattract (KC) production were all decreased (P < 0.05) in Galpha(i2) (-/-) or Galpha(i1/3) (-/-) mice compared with WT mice. In contrast to the role of G(i) proteins as a positive regulator of mediators, LPS-induced production of MIP-1alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were increased in macrophages from Galpha(i1/3) (-/-) mice, and SA-induced MIP-1alpha production was increased in both groups of Galpha(i) protein-depleted mice. LPS-induced production of KC and IL-1beta, SA-induced production of GM-CSF, KC and IP-10, and GBS-induced production of IL-10, GM-CSF and IP-10 were unchanged in macrophages from Galpha(i2) (-/-) or Galpha(i1/3) (-/-) mice compared with WT mice. These data suggest that G(i2) and G(i1/3) proteins are both involved and differentially regulate murine inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in response to both LPS and Gram-positive microbial stimuli.
TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - Development of specific and rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in dairy products by PCR.
AB  - A simple and specific method for direct detection of bovine mastitis pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) in milk products, bacterial samples from milk and isolated bacterial DNA was developed. The method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using sequence-specific primers only for GBS and species-specific primers derived from 16S and 23S rRNA for all chosen species. The presence of the gene of surface immunogenic protein (Sip) in bovine GBS isolates, described previously only in human GBS isolates was confirmed. The GBS detection was performed with the sequence coding for surface immunogenic protein from GBS human isolates designated as Sip specific sequence (SSS); this sequence was selected for specific primer design. The sequence is unique for GBS and was designed from a consensus of all known sip genes. The specific identification was shown on a collection of 75 GBS bovine isolates from different localities in Slovakia. All isolates were positive to SSS, 16S and 23S rRNA sequence. The 16S and 23S rRNA PCR detection was also performed with S. aureus and E. coli isolates and specific PCR products were also detected. The detection limit of this assay for milk products was 6 CFU/microL (i.e. 6000 CFU/mL) for GBS and E. coli, and 16 CFU/microL for S. aureus. This rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic method can be performed within hours and represents an innovative diagnostic tool for the detection of milk pathogens in dairy products.
TI  - Predictors and outcomes for pregnant women with vaginal-rectal carriage of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors and outcomes of pregnant women with vaginal-rectal carriage of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). We performed an unmatched 1:4 case-control study with two control groups (13 CA-MRSA cases, 52 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) controls, and 52 S. aureus-negative controls) via a retrospective medical record review. We found that CA-MRSA cases were 12.5 times significantly less likely to be colonized with group B streptococci (GBS) compared with MSSA controls in multivariable analyses. When we compared MSSA patients with S. aureus-negative patients, we found that MSSA patients were 4.5 times significantly more likely to be colonized with GBS and 11 times significantly more likely to have a postpartum fever > or = 100.4 degrees F in multivariable analyses. Traditional risk factors for hospital-associated MRSA do not appear to predict vaginal-rectal CA-MRSA carriage in pregnant women. Instead, CA-MRSA carriage is significantly associated with lack of GBS carriage. Additional microbiologic studies and epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify the relationship between S. aureus and GBS, given that these two colonizing organisms have the potential to become pathogens.
TI  - [Comparison of antimicrobial and bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects of macrolides antibiotics against clinical isolates, and examination of shape alteration by scanning electron microscope].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides (MLs), erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 4 bacterial species of clinical strains isolated in 2004. Bacterial isolates used were 51 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 20 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 68 of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 120 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolide resistance genes, ermB and mefE, in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, and all of pneumococci were analyzed by PCR. Antimicrobial activities against macrolide-susceptible MSSA of EM and CAM, were more potent than those of RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than EM, CAM and AZM. Against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, 4 antibiotics showed similar antimicrobial activities. Twelve, 1 and 2 strains of MSSA, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to EM, CAM and AZM, whereas RKM was active to almost, but not quite, of them. Among 120 strains of S. pneumoniae, 76 (63.3%) were resistant to EM (MIC; > or = 0.5 microg/mL), and 23, 15 and 28 strains were highly resistant (MIC; > 128 microg/mL) to EM, CAM and AZM, respectively. By contrast, for RKM, there were far fewer resistant strains, and there was no highly resistant strain. PCR analyses of macrolide-resistant genes revealed that 1 resistant strain of S. pyogenes and 2 of S. agalactiae carried mefE and ermB, respectively. In the case of S. pneumoniae, 59, 19 and 5 strains, respectively, carried ermB, mefE and both ermB and mefe. We also studied about bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of MLs using macrolide-susceptible, and ermB- and mefE-carrying S. pneumoniae, and observed morphological alterations of the strains treated with the drugs by a scanning electron microscope. It was demonstrated that RKM had superior bactericidal activities and PAE than other 3 drugs, and potent destructive effects to all of 3 strains.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - Stochastic modeling to determine the economic effects of blanket, selective, and  no dry cow therapy.
AB  - In many countries, blanket dry cow therapy (DCT) is the standard way to dry off cows. Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance, selective DCT is proposed as an alternative. The economic consequences of different types of DCT were studied previously, but variation between input traits and different types of pathogens were not taken into account. The goal of this study was to create a stochastic Monte Carlo model to simulate the dynamics of intramammary infections (IMI) around the dry period to predict the economic consequences of DCT for different types of pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli). The traits used in the model can be varied. The probabilities within the basic situation were collected from the literature and, because not all information needed was available in the literature, by interviewing experts (n = 10). The expert opinions were translated into minimum, most expected, and maximum values for each of the different probabilities. For Dutch farmers, the costs associated with mastitis and mastitis control around the dry period varied between 10.61 euros and 26.61 euros (average 15.60 euros) for blanket DCT, between 4.86 euros and 29.41 euros (average 13.72 euros) for selective DCT, and between 4.08 euros and 42.60 euros (average 18.02 euros) for no DCT. Although there were small differences between the treatment groups, the variation within the treatment groups was much larger. The major portion of the costs for selective treatment (59% of the total costs) and no DCT (82%) was derived from the costs of clinical mastitis after calving, and for blanket DCT, the costs of treatment (65%) exceeded the costs of clinical mastitis (27%). The cost of mastitis around the dry period was most sensitive to a change in the risk of new IMI during the dry period, spontaneous cure, and costs associated with the antibiotic treatment. The optimal decision to dry off cows depends on the attitude of the farmer toward risk and other farm-specific traits and probabilities such as the new IMI rate during the dry period. Therefore, it is necessary to make farm-specific calculations so that farmers are able to factor this information into their decisions when choosing the best DCT for their situations.
TI  - [Community-acquired urinary tract infections in 15 to 65 years old female patients in France. Susceptibility of E. coli according to history: AFORCOPI-BIO network 2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A multicenter study was implemented in order to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of strains isolated from 15 to 65 year old female patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October to December 2003, 11 French private laboratories consecutively collected 420 clinical strains with medical data. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on E. coli were determined using the agar dilution method in a coordinating center and interpretation followed the recommendations of the Comite de l'antibiogramme de la Societe francaise de microbiologie. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (80%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (4%), Klebsiella spp (2%), other Enterobacteriaceae (4%), Enterococcus spp (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2%), and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). The susceptibility of E. coli strains was 61% for amoxicillin (AMX), 93% for nalidixic acid (NAL), 97% for norfloxacin (NOR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), 77% for cotrimoxazole (SXT), 99% for fosfomycin, gentamicin and cefotaxime. The susceptibility of E. coli was lower in case of previous treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics for AMX (84 vs 95% p=0.02) and SXT (62 vs 81% p=0.02). In the same way, previous treatment with quinolones was associated with decreased susceptibility for NAL (84 vs 95% p=0.02) and SXT (62 vs 81% p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In 2003, fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin kept a good activity on E. coli collected from community-acquired urinary tract infections in 15 to 65 years old female patients in France.
TI  - Bacteriological survey of mammary secretions from prepartum heifers in a dairy herd with a high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infection.
AB  - This study was performed to examine the bacteriological findings in 58 mammary secretions from 15 heifers at 4-5 weeks before parturition, and to evaluate whether a high prevalence of S. aureus infection in lactating cows affects the occurrence of S. aureus infection in prepartum heifers in the dairy herd. A total of 86.7%(13/15) of the heifers and 60.3%(35/58) of quarter milk samples from the heifers were bacteriologically positive. No S. aureus isolate was detected in mammary secretions from the heifers. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) species were predominantly detected in 54.3%(19/35) and Streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae were isolated from 22.9%(8/35) of the quarters. A high S. aureus prevalence in the herd may not necessarily be a decisive factor for S. aureus infection in heifers.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae CAMP factor/protein B does not bind to human IgG.
AB  - CAMP factor is an extracellular cytolytic protein produced by Streptococcus agalactiae. CAMP factor has been reported to bind the Fc fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and has therefore also been called protein B, in analogy to protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. We attempted to characterize the interaction of protein B with IgG in more detail. In contrast to protein A, CAMP factor does not inhibit the activation of complement by hemolysin antibodies bound to sheep red cell surfaces. IgG also failed to inhibit the co-hemolytic activity of CAMP factor, which is in disagreement with previous findings. After co-incubation, CAMP factor and IgG were cleanly separated by gel filtration, indicating that no binding had occurred.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a Paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  - A new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. Based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain OSY-DF. The antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin E1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an unknown 2,983-Da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. The latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. The antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium sporogenes, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria spp., Pediococcus cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, it possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali (pH 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. Edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. While details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic, with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. The coproduction of polymyxin E1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. The new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical applications.
TI  - Identification and sequence of a tet(M) tetracycline resistance determinant homologue in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(M) in human clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. The homologue was >99% identical to the tet(M) genes reported to occur in Lactobacillus plantarum, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(M) of Staphylococcus aureus. Sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(M) in E. coli have homology to Tn916; however, a complete IS26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. Downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the ISVs1 element reported to occur in a plasmid from Vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(E). Results of mating experiments demonstrated that the E. coli tet(M) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible strain by conjugation. Expression of the cloned tet(M) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the E. coli host.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - C-terminal WxL domain mediates cell wall binding in Enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Analysis of the genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate V583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. Twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved C-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated WxL. Proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the WxL region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. This hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the C-terminal regions of two WxL proteins in E. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the reporter fusions in E. faecalis. This localization was eliminated by introducing specific deletions into the domains. Interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. We also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for WxL domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. Based on our findings, we propose that the WxL region is a novel cell wall binding domain in E. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the extent of Staphylococcus aureus vaginal-rectal colonization among pregnant women as severe S aureus infections have emerged in pregnant and postpartum women and infants. METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study for methicillin-sensitive S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus on all routine de-identified vaginal-rectal prenatal group B streptococcus (GBS) screening cultures submitted to the microbiology laboratory of a tertiary-care facility from January to July 2005. Standard microbiologic techniques and molecular analyses were used to detect community-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus strains. As opposed to health care-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus isolates, community-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus isolates were defined as those possessing the type IV or type V staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec element and usually lacking a multidrug-resistant phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 2,963 GBS screening cultures were analyzed, from which 743 (25.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 23.5-26.7%) GBS isolates and 507 (17.1%, 95% CI 15.7-18.5%) S aureus isolates were identified. Group B streptococcus colonization was significantly associated with S aureus colonization (prevalence odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5, P < .001). Of the S aureus isolates, 14 (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-4.2%) were methicillin-resistant, and 13 of these were determined to be community-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S aureus colonization identified in GBS screening cultures from pregnant women was substantial and associated with GBS co-colonization. Although we do not advocate routine screening of pregnant women for methicillin-sensitive S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus colonization, we recommend continued monitoring of both methicillin-sensitive S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus infections in this population and their infants.
TI  - Efficacy of two hydrogen peroxide teat disinfectants against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing 0.5% hydrogen peroxide as the active ingredient was compared with a teat disinfectant also containing 0.5% hydrogen peroxide that is commercially available throughout North America. The study was conducted under conditions of experimental challenge with a positive control following the guidelines recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The efficacy of the test product and the positive control product were compared in 45 cows, with 89 total teats receiving each product after milking during a 10-wk study period. There was no significant difference between the experimental hydrogen peroxide product and the positive control in new intramammary infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (27.0 and 18.0% in the treatment groups, respectively). Additionally, there was no significant difference between the experimental product (6.7%) and the positive control groups (4.5%) in new intramammary infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae. Traditional analysis of teat skin condition changes supported improved teat skin condition with the test disinfectant. After accounting for the correlation of teats within cow, significant differences were also observed between the treatment groups for teat skin condition. The experimental hydrogen peroxide-based teat disinfectant provided efficacy similar to that of the positive control teat disinfectant, with significant improvement in teat skin condition and no adverse effects on teat end condition.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of pyranobenzoquinones related to the pyranonaphthoquinone antibiotics.
AB  - The synthesis and antimicrobial activity of isochromane-type analogs of the pyranonaphthoquinone antibiotics are reported. Isochromane derivatives with (17a, b) and without (22a, b) a C-4 hydroxyl moiety and their corresponding quinones (19a and 23), were prepared. Both quinones exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus atrophaeus and Streptococcus agalactiae, while the related isochromanes were inactive. The results suggest that the quinone moiety is important for biological activity while the C-4 hydroxyl may not be essential.
TI  - Potential pathogens carried by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern Spain.
AB  - The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern Spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. We sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with Sarcoptes scabiei. A total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 Mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with S. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. Infections with Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. With Escherichia coli, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida biotype A, and Staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. The isolation frequency for E. coli was higher in females, whereas Moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. The presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and M. haemolytica. The geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of Branhamella ovis, M. agalactiae, and all Pasteurella sp. Isolations of M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, E. coli, and B. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. Of the gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. arginini were the predominant Mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included E. coli, M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, and B. ovis. Isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. In nasal samples, M. haemolytica and P. multocida biotype A were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, B. ovis and E. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.
TI  - Influence of probiotic vaginal lactobacilli on in vitro adhesion of urogenital pathogens to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli, the predominant micro-organisms of the vaginal microbiota, play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract by preventing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of four vaginal Lactobacillus strains, previously selected for their probiotic features, to block in vitro the adherence of three human urogenital pathogens to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Three types of assays were performed in order to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacilli on adhesion of urogenital pathogens to VEC: blockage by exclusion (lactobacilli and VEC followed by pathogens), competition (lactobacilli, VEC and pathogens together) and displacement (pathogens and VEC followed by the addition of lactobacilli). Bacterial adhesion to VEC was quantified by microscopy (x1000) after Gram's stain. All the strains were able to inhibit by exclusion and competition the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to VEC but none was able to decrease the attachment of Escherichia coli by neither of the mechanisms assayed. Only Lactobacillus acidophillus CRL 1259 and Lactobacillus paracasei CRL 1289 inhibited the attachment of Group B streptococci (GBS) to VEC by exclusion and competition respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus of vaginal origin were able to inhibit the attachment of genitouropathogenic Staph. aureus and GBS to the vaginal epithelium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results support the probiotic potential of these Lactobacillus strains as anti-infective agents in the vagina and encourage further studies about their capacity to prevent and manage urogenital tract infections in females.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - Prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk in Prince Edward Island.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to 1) estimate the herd prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk milk from Prince Edward Island (PEI) dairy farms, 2) determine the association between bulk milk culture results and mean bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC), and 3) investigate the agreement of repeated bulk milk cultures. Three consecutive bulk milk samples were obtained at weekly intervals from all 258 PEI dairy herds and were cultured using routine laboratory methods. Cumulative prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Mycoplasma spp. (M. bovis and M. alkalescens) was 74%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. Bulk milk somatic cell count of Staph. aureus-positive herds was higher than that of negative herds. Agreement for Staph. aureus isolation between 3 consecutive tests was moderate (kappa = 0.46). Mycoplasma bovis and M. alkalescens in bulk milk are being reported for the 1st time in PEI ever and in Canada since 1972.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Group B streptococcal bacteremia in non-pregnant adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increasing incidence of group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in non-pregnant adults has been noted in recent years. To understand the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of GBS bacteremia in non-pregnant adults, we conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary teaching hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 94 non-pregnant adults (age >/=18 years) with GBS bacteremia hospitalized between January 2001 and December 2003. RESULTS: The incidence of GBS bacteremia increased from 0.16 cases/1000 admissions in 2001 to 0.30 cases/1000 admissions in 2003 (p=0.017, chi-squared test for trend). The mean age of patients was 64.7 +/- 1.39 years. At least 1 underlying systemic disease was found in 81% of patients, with the most frequent being malignancy (43.6%), diabetes mellitus (42.6%), and liver cirrhosis (16%). The 2 major clinical syndromes were primary bacteremia (34%) and soft tissue infection (31.9%). The overall mortality rate was 20.2%. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 2 most common concurrently isolated bloodstream pathogens. Polymicrobial bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and shock were independent risk factors for mortality in GBS bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence of GBS bacteremia is noteworthy, especially among patients with invasive infections. These infections are also responsible for substantial mortality in elderly patients with underlying diseases. Susceptibility testing indicated that penicillin G remains the drug of choice for GBS bacteremia.
TI  - Lower extremity reconstruction after necrotising fasciitis and necrotic skin lesions using a porcine-derived skin substitute.
AB  - Seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group A Streptococcus, group B Streptococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). All surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds. The average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). No clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. Since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. The use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising fasciitis was easy and effective. Local or systemic infection was negligible.
TI  - Prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance against antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in Brandenburg, Germany.
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in Brandenburg, Germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. A further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. Milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. Resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. Mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS, 9.1% of quarters) and Corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. Among the major pathogens, Staph. aureus (5.7%) and Streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. Although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of CNS was higher in primiparous cows. Results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. Cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. Most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. Cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. Antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. Resistance of Staph. aureus to ampicillin increased significantly during the first lactation. Further research is required to determine the factors that lead to the selection of Staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.
TI  - Short communication: disinfectant containing a complex of skin conditioners.
AB  - The efficacies of 2 new teat dip formulations were tested against experimental challenge by contagious mastitis pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae over a 12-wk period. Formulations contained an iodine complex (0.5 or 1.0% iodine) and skin conditioning agents (propylene glycol, polyvinylpyrridone, glycerine, lanolin, allantoin, and aloe). Percentage reduction (dipped vs. control mammary quarters) in new contagious mastitis pathogen intramammary infections for the 0.5 and 1.0% iodine dips was 65.4 and 84.5, respectively. Both dips were significantly effective in reducing new contagious intramammary infections. Teat skin scores and teat end scores varied over time but were virtually identical for both treated and control teats, for both treatments. Thus, both dips were effective in reducing new contagious mastitis infections without untoward effects on teat skin condition.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - Lactobacilli in the female genital tract in relation to other genital microbes and vaginal pH.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between lactobacilli and other microbes and the association with vaginal pH in the female genital tract were examined. The study also included evaluation of the possibility of supplying probiotics to the genital tract by using panty liners impregnated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum LB931. METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study involving 191 healthy fertile women. Specified microbes were counted and vaginal pH was measured once a month for five consecutive months. RESULTS: Major individual variations in the genital microflora composition and the vaginal pH were found among the women. The number of lactobacilli was significantly related to vaginal pH (p<0.001) and approximately 70% of the women were permanent carriers of individual lactobacilli strains. Women with high numbers of lactobacilli were less prevalent with Group B streptococci than women with low numbers (p=0.036), and these women had a lower mean vaginal pH. The number of lactobacilli also correlated with the prevalence of yeast. LB931 could be found in 86% of the labial samples and 54% of the vaginal samples. CONCLUSIONS: High numbers of lactobacilli may contribute to a low vaginal pH and seem to have a negative influence on Group B streptococci. LB931 could be transferred from the panty liners to both the vagina and the labial fold.
TI  - Infectious causes of reproductive loss in camelids.
AB  - Reproductive losses in camelids are due to infertility, pregnancy loss, udder diseases and neonatal mortality caused by a variety of infectious diseases. Uterine infection and abortion represent the major complaint in camelid veterinary practice. The major infectious organisms in endometritis and metritis are E. coli and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. Abortion rates due to infectious diseases vary from 10% to more than 70% in some areas. Leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and chlamydiosis have been diagnosed as the major causes of abortion in llamas and alpacas. In camels, brucellosis and trypanosomiasis represent the major causes of infectious abortion in the Middle East and Africa. Mastitis is rare in South American camelids. The prevalence of subclinical udder infection in camels can reach very high proportions in dairy camels. Udder infections are primarily due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonatal mortality is primarily due to diarrhea following failure of passive transfer and exposure to E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Coccidia and Salmonella. This paper reviews the etio-pathogenesis of these causes of reproductive losses, as well as the major risk factors and strategies to prevent their occurrence.
TI  - Group B streptococcal cervical osteomyelitis in a neonate.
AB  - Neonatal cervical osteomyelitis is extremely rare, with only a few reported cases. In most instances, Staphylococcus aureus is the infecting organism. The authors report a case of group B streptococcal osteomyelitis affecting the cervical spine. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties that these cases present, and emphasises the role of a multidisciplinary team approach to management.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Peptidoglycan hydrolase fusions maintain their parental specificities.
AB  - The increased incidence of bacterial antibiotic resistance has led to a renewed search for novel antimicrobials. Avoiding the use of broad-range antimicrobials through the use of specific peptidoglycan hydrolases (endolysins) might reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae are human pathogens and also cause mastitis in dairy cattle. The ultimate goal of this work is to create transgenic cattle that are resistant to mastitis through the expression of an antimicrobial protein(s) in their milk. Toward this end, two novel antimicrobials were produced. The (i) full-length and (ii) 182-amino-acid, C-terminally truncated S. agalactiae bacteriophage B30 endolysins were fused to the mature lysostaphin protein of Staphylococcus simulans. Both fusions display lytic specificity for streptococcal pathogens and S. aureus. The full lytic ability of the truncated B30 protein also suggests that the SH3b domain at the C terminus is dispensable. The fusions are active in a milk-like environment. They are also active against some lactic acid bacteria used to make cheese and yogurt, but their lytic activity is destroyed by pasteurization (63 degrees C for 30 min). Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the fusion proteins can be expressed in cultured mammalian cells with no obvious deleterious effects on the cells, making it a strong candidate for use in future transgenic mice and cattle. Since the fusion peptidoglycan hydrolase also kills multiple human pathogens, it also may prove useful as a highly selective, multipathogen-targeting antimicrobial agent that could potentially reduce the use of broad-range antibiotics in fighting clinical infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - A retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania.
AB  - A 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania over the period November 1971-December 2002. Laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. Eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and Escherichia coli (14.1%). Other isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and Streptococcus uberis (4.2%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were Candida species. The results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in November 2002. Conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae remain above 10%. The possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and other antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria from the major teaching hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are an increasingly pressing problem in the clinic. Consequently, linezolid, a recently introduced oxazolidinone with Gram-positive activity, was tested in comparison with 10 other antibiotics against 8103 clinically significant Gram-positive cocci by Etest, disk diffusion and Vitek methods. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activities against all isolates. Vancomycin and teicoplanin demonstrated equally excellent activity against almost all isolates. The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were all susceptible to the glycopeptides and linezolid, but resistant to erythromycin (96%), fusidic acid (91.5%), gentamicin (84%) and clindamycin (73%). Forty one and 39% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 microg/ml) and erythromycin (MIC >1 microg/ml), respectively. S. agalactiae susceptibility was 9% and 10% resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin, respectively. In conclusion, all the Gram-positive isolates tested were susceptible to linezolid. With its oral bioavailability profiles, it obviously holds great promise. Our data should be a useful addition to the literature from the Middle East.
TI  - Evidence for siderophore-dependent iron acquisition in group B streptococcus.
AB  - Mutagenesis of group B streptococcus (GBS) with TnphoZ, a transposon designed to  identify secreted protein genes, identified the gene homologues fhuD and fhuG. The encoded proteins participate in siderophore (hydroxamate)-dependent iron(III) transport in other bacterial species. Sequence analysis of the genome determined that fhuD and fhuG are members of a polycistronic operon comprised of four genes, fhuCDBG, that encode a putative ATPase, cell surface receptor and two transmembrane proteins respectively. We hypothesized that FhuD was a siderophore receptor. Western analysis of cell extracts localized FhuD to the bacterial cell membrane. Fluorescence quenching experiments determined that purified FhuD bound hydroxamate-type siderophores. FhuD displayed highest affinity for iron(III)-desferroxamine, with a K(D) (microM) = 0.05, identical to that described for FhuD2 from Staphylococcus aureus. The role of Fhu in siderophore-iron transport was also characterized. A fhu mutant, ACFhu1, was equally sensitive to the iron-dependent antibiotic streptonigrin as the wild-type strain, suggesting that ACFhu1 was not reduced for intracellular iron concentrations in the absence of exogenous siderophore. However, ACFhu1 transported significantly less siderophore-bound iron in (55)Fe accumulation assays. These data provide the first evidence of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition by GBS.
TI  - Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: a review of 14 cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review and evaluate the management of 14 patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis at National University Hospital, Singapore between 1998 and 2001. METHODS: Demographic pattern, predisposing factors, clinical presentation, co-morbidities, microbiology, treatment, and complications of 14 patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 62.5 years and the male to female ratio was 6:1. The mean follow-up duration was 12.5 months. The most common predisposing condition was diabetes mellitus (n=5). The most common site of infection was the lumbar spine (n=8), followed by the thoracic (n=4) and cervical (n=2) spine. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative organism isolated (n=9), followed by methicillin-resistant S aureus (n=3), Pseudomonas pseudomallei (n=1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n=1). 12 patients were treated surgically: 8 by an anterior approach, 3 by a posterior approach, and one by a combination of the 2. The mean period of antibiotic use was 11.4 weeks. One patient with melioidosis involving the T9 to T11 vertebrae caused by P pseudomallei died of empyema and septicaemia 22 months after presentation. CONCLUSION: Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis is not uncommon in the elderly, especially those with predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus. Computed tomography-guided needle biopsy is recommended to investigate causative microorganisms. Aggressive surgical debridement and prolonged antibiotic therapy were necessary in patients with methicillin-resistant S aureus, P pseudomallei, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Technical note: Improved method for rapid DNA extraction of mastitis pathogens directly from milk.
AB  - Efficient control against bovine mastitis requires sensitive, rapid, and specific tests to detect and identify the main bacteria that cause heavy losses to the dairy industry. Molecular detection of pathogenic microorganisms is based on DNA amplification of the target pathogen. Therefore, efficient extraction of DNA from pathogenic bacteria is a major step. In this study, we aimed to develop a specific, sensitive, and rapid method to extract DNA directly from the main gram-positive bacteria known to cause bovine mastitis (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis) found in milk samples. The DNA extraction method is based on the lysing and nuclease-inactivating properties of the chaotropic agent, guanidinium thiocyanate, together with the nucleic acid-binding properties of the silica particles. An efficient protocol consisting of 6 basic steps (3 of which were done twice) was developed and applied directly to milk samples. Absence of PCR inhibitors and DNA quality were evaluated by PCR amplification of the species-specific DNA sequences of the target bacteria. The level of sensitivity achieved in our experiments is applicable to milk sample analysis without sample enrichment.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - The use of bacteriophages in eliminating polyresistant strains of Staphylococcus  aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Temperate bacteriophages were induced in and released from isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae using mitomycin C. Various specific indicator cultures were tested for providing clear plaques after phage infection. Specific lytic mixture of bacteriophages was prepared using the induced, modified and laboratory variants of phages. Under laboratory conditions, the mixture eliminated all isolates from the tested collection of microorganisms. The restriction barrier of some bacterial isolates to bacteriophage infection was overcome either by UV irradiation or in vitro modification of bacteriophage DNA with specific methyltransferases. Conjugative R plasmids, capable of replication in G+ and G- bacteria, were detected and isolated from S. aureus and S. agalactiae antibiotic-resistant strains.
TI  - CT demonstration of dacryolithiasis complicated by dacryocystitis.
AB  - Cross-sectional imaging has demonstrated an increasing role in the evaluation of  the orbits and the periorbital structures. The case presented in this article demonstrates the rare finding of a dacryolith by CT. To our knowledge, little has been reported on cross-sectional imaging characteristics of this entity in the recent radiologic literature. We demonstrated that CT can be a useful tool in diagnosing both dacryolithiasis and dacryocystitis. Obtaining an early diagnosis of dacryolithiasis is optimal to avoid potential complications, particularly because treatment is often curative.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Resistance of mastitis pathogens in northern Germany].
AB  - The data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from April 2003 through March 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the Institute for Food Quality and Safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. Two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. One third of these were identified as Streptococcus (S.) uberis, one fourth as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. All isolates (100%) of S. uberis, S. dysgalactiae, S. agalactiae and Arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Concering S. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to Oxacillin, Cephalothin, Cefacetril, Cefquinom and Neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to Penicillin, Ampicillin and Cefoperazon. The gram-negative rods (Escherichia (E.) coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. More than 93% of all examined isolates including Pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to Colistin. The sensitivity of E. coli and Klebsiella spp.to Marbofloxacin, Enrofloxacin and Cefquinom exceeded 96%. Thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. Because the highly effective Colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus agalactiae by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis directly from milk. A genetic marker specific for Staph. aureus was used for primers and dual-labeled probe design. The target for Strep. agalactiae primers and dual-labeled probe was selected from the cfb gene encoding the Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen factor. The plasminogen activator gene was the target for primers and dual-labeled probe design for Strep. uberis. Quarter milk samples (n = 192) were analyzed by the multiplex real-time PCR assay and conventional microbiological methods. An additional 57 quarter milk samples were analyzed in a separate real-time PCR assay for Strep. agalactiae only. Using an overnight enrichment step, the real-time PCR technique correctly identified 96.4% of all quarter milk samples; 91.7% of Staph. aureus, 98.2% of Strep. agalactiae, and 100% of Strep. uberis. Results of conventional microbiological methods were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex real-time PCR procedure. The sensitivity of the procedure to correctly identify Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and Strep. uberis directly from milk was 95.5%, and the specificity was 99.6%. Results of this study indicate that the multiplex real-time PCR procedure has the potential to be a valuable diagnostic technique for simultaneous identification of Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and Strep. uberis directly from quarter milk samples.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of caprylic acid and monocaprylin on major bacterial mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is the most significant economic drain on the worldwide dairy industry. Concerns regarding poor cure rates, emergence of bacterial resistance, and residues in milk necessitate development of alternative therapeutic approaches to antibiotics for treatment of mastitis. A variety of free fatty acids and their monoglycerides have been reported to exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. The objective of our study was to examine the efficacy of caprylic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, and its monoglyceride, monocaprylin, to inactivate common mastitis pathogens, including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Milk samples containing 50 mM or 100 mM caprylic acid, and 25 mM or 50 mM monocaprylin were inoculated separately with a 3-isolate mixture of each of the 5 pathogens, and incubated at 39 degrees C. Populations of surviving bacteria were determined at 0 min, 1 min, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of incubation. Both caprylic acid and monocaprylin reduced all 5 pathogens by >5.0 log cfu/mL after 6 h of incubation. Among the bacterial species tested, Strep. agalactiae, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. uberis were most sensitive, and E. coli was most tolerant to caprylic acid and monocaprylin. Results of this study indicate that caprylic acid and monocaprylin should be evaluated as alternatives or adjuncts to antibiotics as intra-mammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Characterization of Weissella kimchii PL9023 as a potential probiotic for women.
AB  - From more than 100 lactic acid bacteria, Weissella kimchii PL9023 was selected as producing the most hydrogen peroxide and was characterized as a probiotic for women. W. kimchii PL9023 inhibited the growth and adherence of vaginal isolates of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The surface components involved in adherence of W. kimchii PL9023 to vaginal epithelial cells appeared to be glycoproteins, as determined by susceptibility to proteinase K, heat, or periodate. W. kimchii PL9023 did not produce harmful metabolites or enzymes. The results of this study suggest that W. kimchii PL9023 is a potential probiotic for vaginal health.
TI  - The use of a hand-held conductivity meter for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows during late lactation.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of a hand-held electrical conductivity meter for the detection of subclinical mastitis in an Australian dairy herd in late lactation. METHODS: A hand-held conductivity meter was evaluated during late lactation in a herd of dairy cows that had a high prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infection. The ability of the conductivity meter to accurately discriminate between uninfected quarters and those infected with major pathogens was assessed, using bacteriology as the definitive test for infection status. Milk samples for bacteriology, and electrical conductivity measurements, were collected from 233 quarters from 59 cows. The ability of the device to identify infected and uninfected cows was also assessed. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for a range of threshold values, using absolute values, the range of quarter values within a cow and the ratio of quarter values within a cow. RESULTS: Electrical conductivity was higher in infected quarters than uninfected quarters, but the degree of overlap between the populations was substantial, even when quarters were assessed as case-control pairs from the same cow. Use of the device according to the manufacturer's recommendations for diagnostic criteria of mastitic quarters had a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 71%. The ability of the device to correctly diagnose the infection status of cows was dependent on both the analytical method and the threshold value used. Applying the manufacturer's recommended criteria to the diagnosis of the status of cows, the sensitivity of the test was 91% and the specificity 17%. CONCLUSION: The variability between individual quarters and between cows in this study was such that the use of this device to measure the conductivity of milk was not a reliable method by which to diagnose subclinical mastitis in cows in late lactation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interpretation of results from handheld conductivity meters when used for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows needs to be made with care. In some circumstances the results obtained do not accurately reflect the bacteriological status of either individual quarters, or cows.
TI  - Group B streptococcal facet joint arthritis: case report.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To report a previously undescribed complication of group B streptococcal infective endocarditis, which was lumbar facet joint arthritis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbar facet joint arthritis is a rare clinical condition, and the casual pathogen is generally Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus agalactiae usually causes peripartum infections affecting the mother and newborn. It rarely causes infective endocarditis, and facet joint arthritis has never been reported before. METHODS: A case of group B streptococcal infective endocarditis and lumbar facet joint arthritis is described. The clinical course, treatment, and complications of facet joint arthritis and infective endocarditis are discussed. RESULTS: A nonimmunocompromised patient presenting with fever and back pain was diagnosed to have S. agalactiae bacteremia. Subsequent imaging with echocardiography revealed mitral valve infective endocarditis and magnetic resonance imaging of lumbar spine showed left L5-S1 facet joint arthritis. Emergent intravenous antibiotic treatment and mitral valve replacement resulted in complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Facet joint septic arthritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with fever and back pain. S. agalactiae should also be considered among the causal pathogens, and, if present, emergent antibiotic treatment, follow-up for complications, and a thorough search for the source of the hematogenous spread, which can be a life-threatening infection, are essential.
TI  - Pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers: novel sequence-selective, DNA-interactive, cross-linking agents with activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective interstrand DNA minor-groove cross-linking agents developed from anthramycins. We investigated the antibacterial activity of three dimers, SJG-136, DRG-16 and ELB-21, which differ in the structure of the PBD monomeric unit and the length of the linker region between the two identical PBD monomers. METHODS: MICs were determined against 38 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 12 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 12 of Streptococcus agalactiae, 12 of Listeria monocytogenes and 24 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Binding to double-stranded DNA was assessed by determination of the DNA melting temperature (T(m)). RESULTS: MIC(90) values for SJG-136 were 0.5 mg/L against MRSA, VRE and L. monocytogenes, 0.06 mg/L against S. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/L against S. agalactiae; these were below the maximum tolerated dose of the drug. MIC(90)s for DRG-16 were 0.125, >0.5, 0.125, 0.015 and <0.008 mg/L, respectively. The most potent compound was ELB-21, with corresponding MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, 0.015 and 0.015 mg/L. There was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. All Gram-negative species (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. PBD dimers showed bactericidal activity against MRSA and VRE and there was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h). Incubation of EMRSA-16 genomic DNA (50 microM) with 20 microM ELB-21 resulted in a large increase in T(m) suggesting that PBD dimers exert their antibacterial effect by cross-linking of the two DNA strands. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that this novel class of antibacterial agents warrants further investigation as potential antibiotics for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Concentration of ascorbic acid in the blood of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - The aim of the investigations was evaluation of ascorbic acia concentration in the blood or cows in the subclinical form of mastitis. The research was conducted on 56 cows. The cows were divided into 4 groups: A, B, and C with subclinical form of mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia col, and D control. The ascorbic acid concentration in the serum of cows was measured by the hydrazine method. We observed a marked decrease in ascorbic acid concentration in the serum of cows from experimental groups A, B and C, respectively: 34.2, 35.9, and 39.4 micromol/dm3 when we compared them with control group D--69.8 micromol/dm3. In cows with subclinical form of inflammation of the mammary gland, a decreased potential of antioxidant protection in the blood was noticed, which manifested itself as a lower ascorbic acid concentration.
TI  - A comparative field trial of cephalonium and cloxacillin for dry cow therapy for  mastitis in Australian dairy cows.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of dry cow agents  containing either cephalonium or cloxacillin within Australian dairy herds. DESIGN: A treatment-control trial. METHODS: Milk from infected quarters of cows with high somatic cell counts in milk on eight Australian dairy farms was cultured to identify bacterial pathogens. Cows were randomly assigned to treatment groups and one group was treated with cephalonium at drying off and the other group was treated with cloxacillin at drying off. Milk samples from infected quarters were collected immediately after calving and were cultured for pathogens. The effect of treatment on bacteriological cure was examined and somatic cell counts from infected cows from the first two herd tests after calving were examined for a treatment effect. On four farms, milk samples were collected for culture from all cases of clinical mastitis identified within the first 7 days after calving. The effect of treatment upon incidence of clinical mastitis after calving was examined. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between treatments on quarter cure rates for new infections, for chronic infections and for infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. Infected quarters treated with cephalonium had a significantly higher cure rate than quarters treated with cloxacillin when Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermids were included as pathogens combined (80.3% versus 70.7%). There was no significant difference between the treatments on somatic cell counts of infected cows at the first two herd tests after calving. There was no difference between treatments on the incidence of clinical mastitis in the first 7 days after calving.
TI  - Role of lipoteichoic acid in the phagocyte response to group B streptococcus.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) cell walls potently activate phagocytes by a largely  TLR2-independent mechanism. In contrast, the cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from diverse Gram-positive bacterial species has been shown to engage TLR2. In this study we examined the role of LTA from GBS in phagocyte activation and the requirements for TLR-LTA interaction. Using cells from knockout mice and genetic complementation in epithelial cells we found that highly pure LTA from both GBS and Staphylococcus aureus interact with TLR2 and TLR6, but not TLR1, in contrast to previous reports. Furthermore, NF-kappaB activation by LTA required the integrity of two putative PI3K binding domains within TLR2 and was inhibited by wortmannin, indicating an essential role for PI3K in cellular activation by LTA. However, LTA from GBS proved to be a relatively weak stimulus of phagocytes containing approximately 20% of the activity observed with LTA from Staphylococcus aureus. Structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry revealed important differences between LTA from GBS and S. aureus, specifically differences in glycosyl linkage, in the glycolipid anchor and a lack of N-acetylglucosamine substituents of the glycerophosphate backbone. Furthermore, GBS expressing LTA devoid of d-alanine residues, that are essential within immune activation by LTA, exhibited similar inflammatory potency as GBS with alanylated LTA. In conclusion, LTA from GBS is a TLR2/TLR6 ligand that might contribute to secreted GBS activity, but does not contribute significantly to GBS cell wall mediated macrophage activation.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Production of bacteriocins by coagulase-negative staphylococci involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  - In the present study, 188 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) strains were isolated from bovine mastitis cases from 56 different Brazilian dairy herds, located in the Southeast region of the country, and were tested for antimicrobial substance production. Twelve CNS strains (6.4%) exhibited antagonistic activity against a Corynebacterium fimi indicator strain. Most antimicrobial substances were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting that they might be bacteriocins (Bac). Amongst the CNS producers, six were identified as S. epidermidis, two as S. simulans, two as S. saprophyticus, one as S. hominis and one as S. arlettae. Plasmid profile analysis of these strains revealed the presence of at least one plasmid. The Bac(+) strains presented either no or few antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Three strains were shown to produce a bacteriocin either identical or similar to aureocin A70, a bacteriocin previously isolated from an S. aureus strain isolated from food. The remaining Bac(+) strains produce antimicrobial peptides that seem to be distinct from the best characterised staphylococcal bacteriocins described so far. Some of them were able to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen, and several strains of Streptococcus agalactiae associated with bovine mastitis, suggesting a potential use of these bacteriocins either in the prevention or in the treatment of streptococcal mastitis.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Influence of modified natural and synthetic surfactant preparations on bacterial  killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  - In addition to its biophysical functions, surfactant plays an important role in pulmonary host defense. In this investigation we studied the influence of various commercially available surfactants on the phagocytosis of bacteria that are common pathogens in the neonatal period. Group B streptococci (GBS), Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured with isolated human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) and non-specific serum in the presence or absence of different modified natural (Curosurf, Alveofact, Survanta) or totally synthetic, protein-free surfactant preparations (Exosurf, Pumactant). Prior to and after 30 and 60 min of incubation with PMN at different surfactant concentrations (1, 10 or 20 mg/ml), the number of viable bacteria was determined by colony counting. Killing of S. aureus by PMN was not influenced by any of the surfactants. Alveofact and Curosurf had no significant negative impact on phagocytosis. At 20 mg/ml, Curosurf even reduced the number of viable E. coli. Survanta at 10 and 20 mg/ml and Exosurf at all concentrations impaired the killing of non-encapsulated GBS and E. coli. Pumactant at 1-20 mg/ml interfered with the phagocytosis of E. coli. In further experiments we demonstrated that Curosurf did not interfere with the phagocytosis of an encapsulated GBS-strain opsonised by a specific antiserum either. In additional experiments we analysed the influence of the different surfactants on the release of reactive oxygen metabolite by PMN and found that the changes in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction did not necessarily correlate with the findings of the studies on killing. In conclusion, we found that killing by PMN was influenced by the bacterial species and the composition and concentration of the different surfactant preparations. The strongest impairment in phagocytic function of PMN was observed with the protein-free synthetic surfactant Exosurf, a phospholipid preparation that contains the alcohols hexadecanol and tyloxapol as spreading agents.
TI  - Endovascular stent-grafting for infected iliac artery pseudoaneurysms.
AB  - We report two cases of acutely infected pseudoaneurysms of the iliac arteries, successfully treated with endovascular stent-grafting. Two patients underwent stent-graft treatment for erosive rupture of the iliac artery caused by surrounding infection. The first case is that of a 61-year-old man who had undergone Miles' operation for an advanced rectal cancer. Postoperatively, he developed intrapelvic abscess formation, from which methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, followed by rupture of the right external iliac artery. The second case is that of a 60-year-old man who had a pseudoaneurysm of the left common iliac artery, which was contiguous with a left psoas muscle abscess, from which Streptococcus agalactiae was cultured. Both patients were successfully treated with only a stent-graft and antibiotic therapy, and remained symptom-free 12 months and 10 months later. Although endovascular stent-grafting should not be considered standard therapy for infected aneurysms, our cases suggest that it can result in repair of infected aneurysms even in the uncontrolled active stage.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial activity evaluation of some new 1-benzoyl-isothiosemicarbazides.
AB  - The synthesis of some aroylisothiosemicarbazides was accomplished and their biological activity against bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria was investigated. Different synthetic pathways were followed according to the kind of substituents that were introduced on both the aroyl ring and the sulfur atom. Anti-bacterial activity was measured against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi, while antifungal activity was evaluated against C. albicans. Two species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV and Mycobacterium avium ATCC19421, were employed to evaluate antimycobacterial activity.
TI  - Efficacy of an iodophore teat disinfectant against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in experimental challenge.
AB  - A 1.0% iodophore teat disinfectant (Full-Bac) was evaluated in comparison with a  positive control (Bovadine), a commercially available 1.0% iodophore teat disinfectant. The study was conducted under conditions of experimental challenge, following the guidelines recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The test product and a positive control were compared in 41 cows, with 82 teats receiving each product at milking, during a 10-wk study period. There were no differences between the test product and the positive control in new intramammary infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, which averaged 13.4% in each of the 2 treatment groups. Additionally, no statistical difference was seen between the test product and positive control in new intramammary infections by Streptococcus agalactiae, which averaged 8.5 and 6.1% for the Full-Bac and Bovadine groups, respectively. Teat skin and teat end condition scores were statistically evaluated at wk 1, 5, and 9 of the study, and no significant differences were observed between the treatment groups. The test teat disinfectant provided similar germicidal activity to that of the positive control teat disinfectant with no adverse effects on teat skin or teat end condition during the warm-season study period.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - [Relationship between morphological characteristics of the teat duct and prevalence of intramammary infections with Streptococcus agalactiae in dairy cows].
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between morphological findings of the surface of teat duct particularly the level of ceratosis and the prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI). The study was conducted on a commercial dairy herd housing about 3000 lactating dairy cows. We examined 891 quarters in the middle of lactation. Duplicate samples of quarter foremilk were collected monthly. The bacteriological status of quarters was determined according to the recommendations of IDF. At the same time teats were evaluated by clinical examinations. The appearance of teat skin lesions and the status of the teat duct especially the existence of hyperceratosis (HC) was documented. Four classes of teat duct hyperceratosis were defined: without, slight, medium and severe HC. The rate of IMI in different classes of hyperceratosis of teat duct was compared by Chi-square analysis. Prevalences of intramammary infections were determined three times (P1, P2 and P3) during the study period. Prevalence of infection was high for S. aureus (P1: 5.6% vs. P2: 4.5% vs. P3: 4.3%), Sc. agalactiae (P1: 2.7% vs. P2: 2.6% vs. P3: 2.8%) and CNS (P1: 10.7% vs. P2: 8.8% vs. P3: 9.6%). Furthermore we detected IMI caused by other streptococci, yeast, E. coli and mixed infections. A positive correlation between status of HC and prevalence of IMI for Sc. agalactiae was found. At the second and third sampling time the rate of intramammary infection with Sc. agalactiae in quarters with medium HC (P2: 9.21% and P3: 13.73%) differed significantly (p < 0.05) compared to groups without (P2: 1.56% and P3: 1.91%) and slight hyperceratosis (P2: 2.33% and P3: 2.56%). The results of our study indicate a correlation between morphology of teat duct surface, especially regarding to Sc. agalactiae. On one hand HC can cause high intramammary infection rate with Sc. agalactiae. On the other hand it is possible that HC is the consequence of a quarter infection with Sc. agalactiae. Further research is required.
TI  - Daptomycin - a novel antibiotic against Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Daptomycin is a novel member of a new class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistant Gram-positive infections. These infections are becoming more commonplace and treatment options are limited. At present, daptomycin is approved for use in the US for complicated skin and skin-structure infections that are a common complication of surgery, diabetic foot ulcers, and burns. The most common causative organisms in these types of infections are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Group C and G streptococci. Traditionally, these infections have been treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents is widespread and increasing. Of particular concern is the rapid increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme reported that approximately 30% of S. aureus isolates from skin and skin-structure infections were MRSA. The standard treatment for MRSA infections is vancomycin but resistance to this agent is also developing. There is a continuing need for the development of new antibiotics with Gram-positive activity, to combat multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Guidelines for monitoring bulk tank milk somatic cell and bacterial counts.
AB  - This study was conducted to establish guidelines for monitoring bulk tank milk somatic cell count and bacterial counts, and to understand the relationship between different bacterial groups that occur in bulk tank milk. One hundred twenty-six dairy farms in 14 counties of Pennsylvania participated, each providing one bulk tank milk sample every 15 d for 2 mo. The 4 bulk tank milk samples from each farm were examined for bulk tank somatic cell count and bacterial counts including standard plate count, preliminary incubation count, laboratory pasteurization count, coagulase-negative staphylococcal count, environmental streptococcal count, coliform count, and gram-negative noncoliform count. The milk samples were also examined for presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Mycoplasma. The bacterial counts of 4 bulk tank milk samples examined over an 8-wk period were averaged and expressed as mean bacterial count per milliliter. The study revealed that an increase in the frequency of isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was significantly associated with an increased bulk tank somatic cell count. Paired correlation analysis showed that there was low correlation between different bacterial counts. Bulk tank milk with low (<5000 cfu/mL) standard plate count also had a significantly low level of mean bulk tank somatic cell count (<200,000 cells/mL), preliminary incubation count (<10,000 cfu/mL), laboratory pasteurization count (<100 cfu/mL), coagulase-negative staphylococci and environmental streptococcal counts (<500 cfu/mL), and noncoliform count (<200 cfu/mL). Coliform count was less likely to be associated with somatic cell or other bacterial counts. Herd size and farm management practices had considerable influence on somatic cell and bacterial counts in bulk tank milk. Dairy herds that used automatic milking detachers, sand as bedding material, dip cups for teat dipping instead of spraying, and practiced pre-and postdipping had significantly lower bulk tank somatic cell and/or bacterial counts. In conclusion, categorized bulk tank somatic cell and bacterial counts could serve as indicators and facilitate monitoring of herd udder health and milk quality.
TI  - Efficacy of a 0.1% iodine teat dip against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae during experimental challenge.
AB  - An experimental challenge trial was performed according to the guidelines recommended by the National Mastitis Council (NMC). A 0.1% iodine teat dip (Quartermate with I-Tech) was examined. This product gave an 87.9% reduction of new intramammary infections with Staphylococcus aureus and a 66.5% reduction for Streptococcus agalactiae compared with a negative control. Teat end and teat skin characteristics remained excellent throughout the trial.

TI  - Seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight European countries.
AB  - This study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). Strains originated in bovine diseases from eight European countries. They were isolated from gut infections (Escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus). There was no change in the MIC distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. In E. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. Over this period the only a significant change seen was an increase in MIC(90) of E. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995 to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). All the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a MIC(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. The use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Relationship between oral motor dysfunction and oral bacteria in bedridden elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between oral bacterial colonization and oral motor dysfunction. STUDY DESIGN: Oral motor dysfunction (swallowing and speech disorders) and detection of oral bacterial species from dental plaque in 55 elderly persons who had remained hospitalized for more than 3 months were investigated and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were significantly higher in subjects with than in those without a swallowing disorder. A similar result was found with regard to the presence of a speech disorder. About half of subjects who had oral motor dysfunction and hypoalbuminemia had colonization by MRSA and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the combination of oral motor dysfunction and hypoalbminemia elevated the risk of opportunistic microorganisms colonization in the oral cavity of elderly patients hospitalized over the long term.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - Characterization of a complex restriction-modification system detected in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae strains isolated from infections of domestic animals.
AB  - Characterization of classic type II restriction-modification systems (RMS) (restriction endonucleases and modification methyltransferases) was carried out in isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae obtained from clinical material. Among the 100 isolates of S. aureus two different RMS type II were detected. The first was expressed in isolates 32 and 33 (Sau32 I and Sau33 I); the targeting sequence was determined as 5'-GGN CC-3' (Sau96 I isoschizomer). The second was found in isolates no. 90, 93, 96*, and 98 (Sau90 I, Sau93 I, Sau96* I, Sau98 I) and enzymes recognized sequence 5'-CTY RAG-3' (SmlI isoschizomer). Analysis of 40 isolates of S. agalactiae revealed only one RMS; it was detected in two isolates (no. 16 and 23; Sag16 I and Sag23 I). Restriction endonuclease expressed by these isolates cleaved DNA in sequence 5'-CTG CA/G-3' (PstI isoschizomer). In RMS-positive S. aureus and S. agalactiae isolates plasmid DNA capable of replication in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was also detected and isolated.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for glycoscreening in biomedical research.
AB  - Application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS to glycoscreening in biomedical projects is highlighted. In the first part recent CE-MS experiments by sheath liquid CE and multiple stage MS are reported. Neutral and negatively charged N-glycan mixtures from ribonuclease B and fetuin, high-mannose type N-glycoforms, oligosaccharides from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae, polysaccharides of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. A particular emphasis is devoted to the applicability of novel off- and on-line CE-MS and tandem MS methods for screening of proteoglycan-derived oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as hyaluronates from Streptococcus agalactiae, chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (CS/DS) from bovine aorta and human skin fibroblast decorin, and heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) from porcine and bovine mucosa. The performance of CE-MS/MS for identification of glycoforms in glycopeptides and glycoproteins is illustrated by experiments performed on complex mixtures from urine of patients suffering from a hereditary N-acetylhexosaminidase deficiency (Schindler's disease) and urine of patients suffering from cancer cachexia. For determination of glycosylation patterns in glycoproteins like enzymes and antibodies by CE/MS, both CE-matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and CE-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS were functional. Finally, the potential of CE-ESI-MS strategy in glycolipid analysis is demonstrated for gangliosides from bovine brain for which particular CE buffer conditions are required.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - Previous chemotherapy as a predictor of wound infections in nonmajor head and neck surgery: Results of a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this prospective study was to determine the incidence of  wound infections (WI) after clean uncontaminated head and neck cancer procedures and after emergency tracheotomies. METHODS: Two hundred twelve clean procedures without tracheotomy or opening of mucosa (neck dissections, large skin resections, thyroidectomies, parotid gland resections, and explorative cervicotomies) were studied at Oscar Lambret Cancer Center over a 24-month period. RESULTS: WI rate was 6.6% (14 of 212). In a univariate analysis, only one variable was significantly related to the likelihood of WI: previous anticancer chemotherapy. All but one patient who had had previous chemotherapy demonstrated WI (14 of 15). CONCLUSIONS: After previous chemotherapy, WI rate in clean uncontaminated head and neck surgery was as high as 90%. In this case, antibiotic prophylaxis should be evaluated.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - Young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. Cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. Present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. Three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of AOM received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. Clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. There was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. A satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. In conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. Moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by U.S. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. The widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. Current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (CNS) pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from CNS specimens was analyzed using The Surveillance Database (TSN) USA Database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 US hospital laboratories. A total of 6029 organisms derived from CNS specimen sources during 2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. Gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. The modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. Penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for S. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for S. agalactiae. For CSF isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was S. pneumoniae (3.5%), E. coli (0.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), Serratia marcescens (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (0%). Listeria monocytogenes and N. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. This data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat CNS infections.
TI  - Comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme M and  P.
AB  - Lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. Mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme M and P, but only the M enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. Disruption of the lysozyme M locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a Gram-negative bacterium. Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme M-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. Muramidase activity in lysozyme M-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme P mRNA and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. The muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme P was less than that of recombinant M lysozyme. Recombinant P lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected Gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme M to achieve the same level of killing. The lower antimicrobial activity of P lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by P lysozyme in lysozyme M-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. Recombinant lysozyme M and P were equally effective in killing selected Gram-positive organisms. This outcome suggests that disruption of both M and P loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor BB-83698.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: BB-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in Europe. The purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. METHODS: The in vitro activities of BB-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 Staphylococcus aureus, 110 Haemophilus influenzae and 50 Moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. Broth microdilution MICs and MBCs were determined according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: The MIC90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-, erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. The MIC90s for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/L and for viridans streptococci, the MIC90 was 0.5 mg/L. Against S. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the MIC90 was 8 mg/L. Against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive H. influenzae, the MIC90s were 32 and 64 mg/L, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive M. catarrhalis the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. In MBC studies, the ratio of MBC/MIC was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of S. pneumoniae, 33% of S. aureus, 63% of H. influenzae and 9% of M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BB-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against H. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and Moraxella.
TI  - Daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibacterial with rapid in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci. It is approved for use in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by specified Gram-positive cocci. In vitro, daptomycin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, group C and G beta-haemolytic streptococci and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Bactericidal activity in vitro was rapid and concentration dependent. In two randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trials in patients with cSSSIs, intravenous daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was as effective as standard therapy (intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin 4-12 g/day or vancomycin 1 g 12-hourly). Clinical success rates assessed 6-20 days after treatment end were 82.1% in daptomycin recipients and 82.9% in recipients of standard therapy (pooled data). In patients with cSSSIs, the adverse event profiles of daptomycin and vancomycin were similar. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels increased in 2.8% of daptomycin recipients and 1.8% of patients who received standard therapy; only one daptomycin recipient (0.2%) experienced increased CPK levels and muscle symptoms that were not associated with any comorbid factors.
TI  - Effects of an automatic postmilking teat dipping system on new intramammary infections and iodine in milk.
AB  - A technology of automatically applying a postmilking teat dip via the milking machine prior to machine detachment was compared to manual postmilking teat dipping with a teat dip cup for effects on new IMI and iodine content in milk. One hundred twenty Holstein cows were experimentally challenged in a 22-wk trial with Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and 148 Holstein cows were experimentally challenged with Streptococcus uberis in another 22-wk trial. The bacterial suspensions were applied to teats of all of the cows after premilking udder preparation and immediately prior to milking machine attachment. In both trials, cows were divided among four treatments: no postmilking teat dipping; manual postmilking teat dipping with a proven efficacious iodophor teat dip; manual postmilking teat dipping with an iodophor teat dip formulated for an automatic postmilking teat dipping system; and automatically postmilking teat dipping via milking machines with an iodophor teat dip formulated for the automatic postmilking teat dipping system. The postmilking teat dipping treatments reduced new Staph. aureus IMI by 64.5, 76.5, and 88.2%; new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 61.5, 77.8, and 94.4%; and new Strep. uberis IMI by 63.5, 82.5, and 93.8%, respectively, against the treatment of no postmilking teat dipping. The treatment applying the postmilking teat dip automatically via milking machines had the lowest number of new IMI caused by the three pathogens. Teat end and teat skin condition were characterized as normal at the end of the study with no differences between treatments. There were no differences with regard to iodine content in milk between treatments.
TI  - L-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall constituent of Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the lectin pathway of complement.
AB  - The lectin pathway of complement is activated when a carbohydrate recognition complex and associated serine proteases binds to the surface of a pathogen. Three recognition subcomponents have been shown to form active initiation complexes: mannan-binding lectin (MBL), L-ficolin, and H-ficolin. The importance of MBL in antimicrobial host defense is well recognized, but the role of the ficolins remains largely undefined. This report shows that L-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component found in all Gram-positive bacteria. Immobilized LTA from Staphylococcus aureus binds L-ficolin complexes from sera, and these complexes initiate lectin pathway-dependent C4 turnover. C4 activation correlates with serum L-ficolin concentration, but not with serum MBL levels. L-ficolin binding and corresponding levels of C4 turnover were observed on LTA purified from other clinically important bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. None of the LTA preparations bound MBL, H-ficolin, or the classical pathway recognition molecule, C1q.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Efficacy of two iodine teat dips during experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - An experimental challenge trial was performed against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae following the procedures recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The efficacy of two teat dips, product 1 (Bovadine with I-Tech II) and product 2 (Bovadine with I-Tech, used as a positive control), was determined. Both teat dips contain 1% iodine and 10% glycerin. Product 1 established an 89.7% reduction in infections against Staph. aureus and 73.1% reduction in infections against Strep. agalactiae. Product 2 demonstrated an 86.2% reduction in infections against Staph. aureus and 78.4% reduction in infections against Strep. agalactiae. Teat skin and teat ends were evaluated before and after the trial. No significant change in teat condition was observed for either product.
TI  - Results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination in Wisconsin from 1994 to 2001.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between 1994 and 2001. Results (n = 83,650) of microbiological testing of milk samples (n = 77,172) submitted to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from January 1994 until June 2001 were analyzed. Submissions included milk samples obtained from cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis as well as samples obtained for mastitis surveillance programs. Results were recorded as no growth, contaminated, or identified as specific bacterial pathogens. Statistical analysis was performed to determine trends in the isolation of mastitis pathogens. The proportion of samples identified as contaminated decreased from 20.6 (1997) to 9.5% (2001). The proportion of samples coded as no growth increased from 22.6 (1994) to 49.7% (2001). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 17.7% (1994) of isolates to 9.7% (2001), while isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased from 8.1 (1994) to 3.0% (2001). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 12.7 to 17.5%, environmental Streptococcus spp. were isolated from 11.6 to 20.1%, and Escherichia coli were isolated from 3.1 to 6.7% of all isolates. No growth and contaminated samples comprised almost 50% of total submissions, and it is important that producers have proper expectations when submitting milk samples. The proportion of isolates identified as Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae decreased, suggesting the proportion of contagious bacteria causing mastitis has decreased. Environmental and contagious pathogens demonstrated characteristic differences by season.
TI  - Constitutive expression of PcsB suppresses the requirement for the essential VicR (YycF) response regulator in Streptococcus pneumoniae R6.
AB  - We report several new findings about the function of the essential VicRK two-component regulatory system (TCS) in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. The vicR-encoded response regulator, vicK-encoded histidine kinase and the protein encoded by the downstream vicX gene are the homologues of the YycF, YycG and YycJ proteins, respectively, studied previously in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Using a regulatable promoter, we demonstrated that the VicK histidine kinase is conditionally required for growth of S. pneumoniae. Likewise, we found that the VicX protein is also conditionally required for growth and probably plays a role in the essential signal transduction pathway mediated by VicR and VicK. Recovery of limited substitutions in the conserved aspartate 52 residue (D52) of VicR was consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation of VicR for growth under some conditions. We applied microarrays to characterize the changes in transcription patterns in bacteria depleted for vicRKX operon expression. Our results suggest that the pcsB gene is a target of the VicRK TCS. We present evidence that downregulation of pcsB could account for many of the defects in cell growth, shape, size and morphology observed in bacteria depleted for vicRKX expression. Furthermore, constitutive expression of pcsB+ suppressed the essential requirement for the VicRK TCS and allowed the isolation of vicR null mutants.
TI  - Enhancement of antimicrobial effects by glucocorticoids.
AB  - In the past few years a body of evidence has accumulated showing that stimulation of human astrocytes and microvascular endothelial cells with IFN-gamma induces a potent antibacterial and anti-parasitic effect. We have found that the IFN-gamma-mediated activation of the tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is, at least in part, responsible for this antimicrobial activity. Glucocorticoids are frequently used in inflammatory central nervous system diseases to reduce the inflammatory reaction and cerebral edema. Since in many inflammatory conditions infection is either a primary or secondary factor, steroids are administered, in these circumstances, during infection. We investigated whether steroids could affect the antimicrobial effect of IFN-gamma-induced IDO activation. We found that hydrocortisone and dexamethasone enhance IFN-gamma-mediated IDO activity in both human astrocytoma cells and native human astrocytes. Furthermore, we found that the amounts of IDO mRNA and of IDO protein are enhanced in cells treated with IFN-gamma and glucocorticoids. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that both steroids enhance the IFN-gamma-mediated antimicrobial activity against Toxoplasma gondii, Staphylococcus aureus and group B streptococci. The enhanced antimicrobial effect of IFN-gamma in the presence of glucocorticoids is due to the enhancement of the IDO-mediated tryptophan degradation, demonstrated by the complete abrogation of this antimicrobial effect by tryptophan resupplementation. These data show that glucocorticoids, which were often used to inhibit proinflammatory processes, do not decrease IDO-mediated antimicrobial effects. In contrast, high doses of steroids were able to enhance the IFN-gamma-induced antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [Antimicrobial action of ammonium salts of fused heterocycles containing ortho-nitrogen].
AB  - By alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding N-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. The quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. The susceptibility of Gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella cholerae suis, Salmonella enteridis Gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium salts by disc difussion method has been detected. The bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. It was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. The action of these two compounds against Salmonella and Streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. It was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of N-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and N-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against P. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in South Croatia: aetiology and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of uropathogens isolated  from outpatients living in South Croatia and the in vitro susceptibility of these organisms to antimicrobial agents. Of 5080 enrolled uropathogen isolates, 82.28% isolates were Gram-negative, the most frequent isolates being Escherichia coli (62.62%), enterococci (10.18%), Proteus mirabilis (5.31%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.84%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.70%), Pseudomonas spp. (3.46%), Klebsiella spp. (2.38%). The E. coli resistance rate was 42.17% to amoxycillin, 20.59% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and 6.09% to norfloxacin. Almost all Klebsiella spp. isolates were resistant to amoxycillin and the resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was over 20%, and 14.15% to the fluoroquinolones. A high methicillin-resistance rate was found among S. aureus (61.22%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (41.48).
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the USA and Europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in hospitalised patients were studied. Data were reported by clinical laboratories in the USA, France, Germany, Italy and Spain during 2001 which participate in The Surveillance Network (TSN). Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. MRSA was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of S. aureus in each country, respectively. The majority of MRSA were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (France) to 15.9% (Italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (France) to 87.0% (Italy) resistant. More than 99.0% of MSSA tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (France) to 94.6% of MSSA (Germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (USA) to 86.6% (Spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (Italy) to 99.2% (France) were gentamicin susceptible. MSSA were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. Overall, 100% of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Macrolide resistance was common among S. agalactiae (20.7%, Germany to 10%, Italy and Spain), S. pyogenes (19.2%, France to 11.1%, USA) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, France to 14.1%, Germany). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside the USA (17.5%) and Italy (7.4%). For all countries susceptibility of E. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Susceptibility of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in Spain to 94.3% in Germany. Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. Putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in E. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in USA, Italy and Spain and in France and Germany <2%. For P. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. Surveillance data should be considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating SSTI.
TI  - Secondary infections with beta-hemolytic streptococci in skin lesions.
AB  - Secondary infections (SI) in skin lesions are common. In the present study 40 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 36 patients suffering from SI due to various skin diseases. Staphylococcus aureus coexisted with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 29 of these cases (81%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci were often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci and gram-positive rods. Eighteen patients (50%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. In most cases of SI due to atopic dermatitis (AD), the predominant species was S. aureus, while in other skin diseases, S. aureus and beta-haemolytica streptococci were predominant in approximately 50% of the patients, except for SI due to tumors and viral diseases. The mean age of patients with SI and beta-hemolytic streptococci was 37 years and that of patients with SI and predominant S. aureus was 32 years. The lower mean age found for S. aureus was due to SI found in patients with AD. This study emphasizes the polymicrobial microbiology of SI.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. Bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. S. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. Antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as EM and CAM, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. Six, three and four strains of S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. Thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, MIC of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of EM, CAM or AZM. Isolation frequency of resistant strains to RKM was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. No resistant strain was recognized in M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. Methylation was major mechanism in S. aureus, and in S. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. In S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Bulk tank milk analysis: factors associated with appearance of Mycoplasma sp. in  milk.
AB  - Factors associated with the presence of Mycoplasma sp. in bulk tank milk samples  were evaluated from 664 herds during 2.25 years. Milk quality components were not strongly related to the presence of Mycoplasma sp. in bulk tank milk. The presence of other contagious mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, was also not related to the presence of mycoplasma, suggesting that the aetiology and transmission of mycoplasma mastitis were different from transmission of other contagious mastitis pathogens. The occurrence of the first isolation of mycoplasma from a bulk tank was not correlated to season of the year. Mycoplasma in bulk tank milk samples were more likely to be found in herds shipping more milk, an indirect measure of herd size. This suggests that larger herds are more likely to have mycoplasma mastitis. However, the first appearance of mycoplasma mastitis in a bulk tank sample was followed by a sample without this pathogen in more than 60% of herds. Mycoplasma sp. was not detected in any herd a year after first isolation. These findings suggest that this pathogen could be controlled and eliminated from herds.
TI  - Occurrence of clinical and sub-clinical mastitis in dairy herds in the West Littoral Region in Uruguay.
AB  - Twenty-nine dairy farms were selected to determine the incidence of clinical mastitis, prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis and bacterial aetiology in the West Littoral Region of Uruguay. In samples taken by the owner and frozen at -20 degrees C during a week the incidence rate of clinical mastitis was determined as 1.2 cases per 100 cow-months at risk. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolated pathogen in 37.5% of 40 milk samples from clinical cases obtained in 1 month. No bacteria grew in the 32.5% of the total samples. A sub-sample including 1077 dairy cows from randomly selected farms was used to determine the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. These samples were taken on one visit to each farm. The prevalence was 52.4% on a cow basis and 26.7% on an udder quarter basis. In 55.1% of the quarters of the selected animals with more than 300,000 cells/ml there was no growth. The isolated pathogens from sub-clinical cases and their relative frequencies were: Staphylococcus aureus 62.8%, Streptococcus agalactiae 11.3%, Enterococcus sp. 8%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 7.4%, Streptococus uberis 6.4%, Streptococcus dysgalactiae 1.8%, Escherichia coli 1.5% and Staphylococcus hyicus coagulase-positive 0.6%.
TI  - Multiplex polymerase chain reaction as a mastitis screening test for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis in bulk milk samples.
AB  - Effective diagnostic tools for screening herds for mastitis pathogens are important in development and monitoring of mastitis control programmes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis was used in preliminary studies to assess its applicability as an alternative method for monitoring mastitis caused by these organisms at the herd level. PCR was used to detect the presence of these organisms in bulk milk samples. Correlations with bulk milk somatic cell counts (BMCC), total bacteria counts and thermoduric bacteria counts were evaluated. A total of 176 bulk milk samples were collected from 42 herds on five consecutive occasions at approx. 10-d intervals. Str. uberis was the most common organism in these bulk milk samples. There was no relationship between presence of either Staph. aureus, Str. dysgalactiae or Str. uberis and BMCC, total bacteria counts or thermoduric bacteria counts. However, presence of Str. agalactiae was associated with high BMCC and total bacteria counts. The results of this study show that regular analysis of bulk milk using this multiplex PCR assay may be a useful tool for monitoring herd status with respect to Str. agalactiae, but is of less value for monitoring occurrence of Staph. aureus, Str. dysgalactiae and Str. uberis. Further investigations are needed to clarify the relationship between positive PCR results and the prevalence of infected cows in the herd.
TI  - Bovine mastitis in selected areas of southern Ethiopia.
AB  - A study on bovine mastitis, designed to determine the causal agents, prevalence of infection and impact of risk factors in three cattle breeds, was conducted in selected areas of southern Ethiopia. A total of 307 lactating and non-lactating cows, of which 162 were indigenous Zebu, 85 Jersey and 60 Holstein-Friesian. were examined by clinical examination and the California mastitis (CMT) test. Of these, 40.4% were positive by CMT and bacteriology for clinical or subclinical mastitis, with prevalence rates of 37.1% and 62.9%, respectively. Out of 1133 quarters examined, 212 (18.7%) were found to be infected, 83 (39.21%) clinically and 129 (60.8%) subclinically. The prevalence of mastitis was significantly higher in Holstein-Friesian than in indigenous Zebu, in non-lactating cows than in lactating cows, in the early lactation stage than in the mid-lactation stage, in cows with lesions and/or tick infestation on skin of udder and/or teats than in cows without this factor, and in the wet season than in the dry season. Mastitis increased with parity number (R = 0.9). Of 248 CMT and clinically positive udder quarter samples analysed microbiologically, 212 were culturally positive for known mastitis pathogens and 36 were negative. Of the 199 positive samples. Staphylococcus accounted for 39.2%. Streptococcus for 23.6%, coliforms for 14.1%, Micrococcus and Bacillus species for 8.0% each and Actinomyces or Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) for 7.0%. It was concluded that there was a high prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli, in this study area.
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Subcutaneous drainage versus no drainage after minilaparotomy in gynecologic benign conditions: a randomized study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of subcutaneous drainage in patients who are affected by benign gynecologic diseases that are treated by a Kustner's minilaparotomy incision. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a randomized controlled study with 72 patients who underwent operation for benign gynecologic disease. Patients were assigned intraoperatively to two groups: group A (36 patients) had a closed drainage system and group B (36 patients) had no drainage. Historic data, clinical and surgical characteristics, and perioperative complications were recorded prospectively. Postoperative care data, surgical incision complications, and hospital stay were analyzed. Patients were to be seen 4 weeks after the operation to assess wound healing. RESULTS: No patients had intraoperative complications or blood transfusions. A significant difference was observed between the drainage versus no-drainage groups regarding postoperative complications and hospital stay (P =.001, both groups). No patients had surgical complications at 4 weeks after the last operation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that routine prophylactic subcutaneous drainage is indicated in patients who undergo Kustner's minilaparotomy incision for benign gynecologic operation. Drains significantly prevent wound complications and reduce hospital stay.
TI  - Tuberculous tenosynovitis of the tibialis anterior tendon: a case report.
AB  - Tuberculous tenosynovitis is an uncommon form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis occurring primarily in the hands and wrists with limited reports involving the lower extremities. We report a rare case of tuberculous tenosynovitis of the tibialis anterior tendon occurring in a 37-year-old Filipino male. The tendon was surgically debrided and the patient was given a six month course of antituberculin chemotherapy. At one year postoperatively, the patient has good function with no evidence of recurrence.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Quarter milk somatic cell count in infected dairy cows: a meta-analysis.
AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects associated with intramammary infection (IMI) by a bacterium or a group of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, Staphylococci other than S. aureus, and Corynebacterium bovis) on the somatic cell count (SCC) in quarter milk of dairy cows. Papers selected for analysis had to provide SCC values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. Sampling for measurement of SCC and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. Only papers published in English or in French after 1971 were considered. Twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. The animals sampled, the measurement techniques for SCC and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. The meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean SCC (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on SCC of each type of infection. The geometric mean SCC in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/mL. In case of IMI, the retained SCC was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/mL in quarters infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than S. aureus and Corynebacterium bovis, respectively. The variation factors that could influence these SCC values and the bacteriological results are discussed.
TI  - Field validation of a milk line sampling device for monitoring milk quality and udder health.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of a milk line sampling device to obtain a representative sample by comparing SCC and bacterial culture results between milk line and bulk tank samples for milk harvested from the same group of cows at the same milking. A total of 42 paired milk line and bulk tank samples were collected at separate milking events from 21 different herds. Concordance correlation coefficients showed a high level of agreement between the two sample types, with values ranging between 0.74 and 0.99 for all parameters and bacterial species measured. ANOVA showed that SCC and bacterial culture results for Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus non-agalactiae, Coliforms, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were neither numerically or statistically different between milk line and bulk tank samples. KAPPA analysis showed that overall agreement beyond chance between milk line and bulk tank samples in determining whether a herd was positive or negative for either Strep. agalactiae or Staph. aureus were 100 and 75%, respectively. While further research is needed to fully assess the utility of this tool for the purpose of bacterial culture, the results of this study suggest that the strategy of milk line sampling is a very promising monitoring tool. This sampling strategy should provide producers with inexpensive and timely information that will help to improve programs for monitoring milk quality and udder health in commercial dairy herds.
TI  - Microbiological quality and somatic cell count of ewe milk with special reference to staphylococci.
AB  - A total 1502 useful half udders of 762 Churra ewes from eight herds were aseptically sampled in midlactation to study both the bacteriological isolates and the SCC of milk. Corynebacteria, enterococci, micrococci, staphylococci, and streptococci represented 11.2, 2.9, 1.4, 78.9, and 3.1% of all isolates, respectively. Within staphylococci, novobiocin-sensitive species (71.1%) were much more frequently isolated than novobiocin-resistant ones (7.8%). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (53.2% of the isolates). Log SCC of uninfected half udder milk was 4.86. Isolates of novobiocin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, and corynebacteria were associated to low values of log SCC (4.85 to 5.20). In contrast, infection by novobiocin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci organisms was related to a sharp inflammatory response with log SCC means between 5.92 and 6.32. The species that showed the highest log SCC were Pasteurella haemolytica (7.62), Streptococcus agalactiae (7.28), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.68). High prevalence of infections by novobiocin-sensitive staphylococci together with high SCC related to such infections show a relevant role of these organisms in ewe mastitis. Consequently, implementation of staphylococcal mastitis control programs would be of great interest in dairy ewe herds to improve microbiological and hygienic quality of milk.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  - Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For Strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - The effect of temperature on bactericidal properties of 10% povidone-iodine solution.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ten percent povidone-iodine (PVI) is commonly used as a bactericidal solution before amniocentesis is performed. Warming PVI may increase patient comfort; however, the effect of warming on its bactericidal properties is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of warming 10% PVI on its bactericidal properties. STUDY DESIGN: Room temperature of PVI was 25 degrees C, and temperature in an ultrasonic gel warmer was 32 degrees C. In vitro experiments were conducted in 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C water baths. Nine milliliters of PVI at each temperature was added to 1 mL of bacteria (10(7) organisms/mL Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus). After 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 minutes, 1-mL samples were removed and added to 4 mL of 0.5% sodium thiosulfate (to neutralize the iodine and interrupt bactericidal action). The number of viable organisms was determined by plating 0.1-mL samples on trypticase soy agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. For in vivo experiments in 40 volunteers, a 9-cm2 area of the dorsum of each hand was wiped with a sterile cotton swab to obtain a sample of bacteria for culture. The area was then wiped for 15 seconds with PVI at 25 degrees C or 32 degrees C and recultured. The bactericidal properties of PVI at each temperature were compared. The Mann-Whitney U test was used as appropriate, and P <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In vitro, PVI was bactericidal against E coli, S aureus, Enterococcus species, and group B Streptococcus within 0.25 minutes at both 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, with median bacterial growth of 0 CFU/plate for each species of bacteria studied (3 replicates at each temperature). Median bacterial growth from skin was 4 CFU/plate (range, 0 to >100). After hands were wiped with PVI at 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, median bacterial growth was 0 CFU/plate (range, 0-8) and 0 CFU/plate (range, 0-15), respectively (not significant). CONCLUSION: PVI is as effective at 32 degrees C as it is at 25 degrees C. Use of PVI at 32 degrees C should be considered to increase patient comfort in procedures performed without the use of anesthetics.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - [B Streptococcus and other pathogenic bacteria colonization in hospitals in the Gdansk Metro Area].
AB  - A survey of group B Streptococcus and other pathogenic bacteria colonization was  carried out on 658 neonates in 8 neonatal wards of hospitals in the Gdansk Metro Area and the district of Gdansk. Out of pathogenic bacteria Haemophilus and enteric bacteria the most frequently were isolated. The percentage of Staphylococcus aureus was relatively low (19.4). The group B Streptococcus frequency in throat was established as 3.8% and ranging from 1.7 to 8.8% in particular wards. In two cases group B streptococcus were not isolated. In probes taken from anus of newborn tested typical enteric flora dominated and E coli and Klebsiella sp were the most frequently encountered. Profile and frequency of bacterial colonization indicated that epidemiological situation in majority of particular wards in similar.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Killing of Gram-positive cocci by fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  - The susceptibilities of three Gram-positive cocci to medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their one-monoglycerides were studied. The bacteria were incubated with equal volumes of lipid solutions for 10 min. Lauric acid, palmitoleic acid and monocaprin reduced the number of CFU by 6.0 log10 or greater at 5 mM concentration for streptococci of group A (GAS) and group B (GBS). When further compared at lower concentrations and after longer incubation time monocaprin proved to be the most active. Capric acid showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus at 10 mM. However, at lower concentrations monocaprin was the only lipid that showed significant activity against S. aureus. The mode of action of monocaprin against GBS was studied by a novel two-color fluorescent assay of bacterial viability and by electron microscopy. The results indicate that the bacteria are killed by disintegration of the cell membrane by the lipid, leaving the bacterial cell wall intact. The highly lethal effect of monocaprin indicates that this lipid might be useful as a microbicidal agent for prevention and treatment of infections caused by these bacteria.
TI  - Reduction of mastitis caused by experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae by use of a quaternary ammonium and halogen-mixture teat dip.
AB  - A teat-dip formulation containing sodium dichloro isocyanuric acid, bronopol, and quaternary ammonium was tested for efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae intramammary infections (IMI) using an experimental challenge model. Sixty-two Jersey cows from the Hill Farm Research Station (Homer, LA) were used in an 8-wk controlled infection trial to evaluate the teat dip. During the afternoon milking, Monday through Friday for 8 wk, all teats of each cow were immersed to a depth of approximately 25 mm in a challenge suspension containing approximately 5 x 10(7) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus and approximately 5 x 10(7) cfu of Streptococcus agalactiae immediately after milking machines were removed. Immediately after challenge, the distal 25 mm of two contralateral teats were dipped with the experimental teat dip; the remaining two teats served as undipped controls. The experimental teat dip reduced the number of new Staph. aureus IMI by 70.9% and reduced the number of new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 60.0%. Teat end and teat skin condition were characterized as normal and without irritation at the completion of the study. The combination of the three germicides in this experimental teat dip is unique and an effective formulation without adverse effects on condition of teat ends or teat skin.
TI  - Efficacy of two acidified chlorite postmilking teat disinfectants with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid on prevention of contagious mastitis using an experimental challenge protocol.
AB  - Two acidified sodium chlorite postmilking teat disinfectants were evaluated for efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae by using National Mastitis Council experimental challenge procedures. The effect of these teat dips on teat skin and teat end condition was also determined. Both dips contained 0.32% sodium chlorite, 1.32% lactic, and 2.5% glycerin. Dips differed in the amount of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (0.53 or 0.27%) added as a surfactant. Both dips significantly reduced new intramammary infection (IMI) rates compared with undipped controls. The dip containing 0.53% dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid reduced new IMI by Staph. aureus by 72% and Strep. agalactiae by 75%. The dip containing 0.27% dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid reduced new IMI by Staph. aureus by 100% and by Strep. agalactiae by 88%. Changes in teat skin and teat end condition for treatment and control groups varied in parallel over time. Teats treated with either teat dip had higher mean teat skin and teat end scores than control teats at some weeks. However, teat skin and teat end condition did not tend to change from the start to the completion of the trial. Application of the two new postmilking teat dips was effective in reducing new IMI from contagious mastitis pathogens. (Key words: teat dip, contagious mastitis, chlorous acid)
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - Effect of preculture freezing and incubation on bacteriological isolation from subclinical mastitis samples.
AB  - In this study the sensitivity of three methods of isolation of udder pathogens from milk samples from subclinical mastitis cases was compared. For analysis 1827 quarter milk samples were selected. Milk was cultured using a standard culture technique (0.01 ml of fresh milk streaked on a sheep blood agar plate and on Edward's medium). In addition, an inoculum of 0.01 ml of the original milk sample was incubated for 24h at 37 degrees C in broth, followed by culture using the standard culture technique. In the third method, the whole milk sample was frozen for 24h, and then incubated for 24h at 37 degrees C, followed by culture using standard culture technique. The isolation percentage of Staphylococcus aureus was 4.7% for standard culture technique, 14.2% for incubation in broth, and 21.5% for the combination of freezing plus incubation. Isolation percentage of Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus agalactiae was highest using the standard culture technique, while isolation rate of Streptococcus uberis was not different among the three methods used. With increasing somatic cell count, the likelihood of S. aureus, S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis isolation increased. Based on the relative sensitivity, defined as the isolation rate using a single technique compared to the isolation rate of the three techniques together, a combination of standard culture technique and freezing plus incubation was most attractive for achieving a high isolation rate of S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae. Relative sensitivity of S. uberis isolation was highest using the standard culture technique and incubation in broth, while S. aureus was most often isolated using a combination of incubation in broth and freezing plus incubation. A combination of the three methods increased the isolation rate for S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis and S. aureus. The standard culture technique, together with the combination of freezing plus incubation, can be recommended for isolating major udder pathogens. If S. aureus is the pathogen of main interest, using incubation in broth together with the combination of freezing plus incubation performed best.
TI  - Definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. SAMPLE: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. METHODS: Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). RESULTS: Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. CONCLUSION: Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Sample preparation of Gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  - A new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell Gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI ToF MS). With fresh, whole-cell Gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kDa. Because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for Gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by MALDI ToF MS. Lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kDa protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. A significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kDa range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. We show that for four different species (Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. The data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.
TI  - Production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections. METHODS: Human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. After 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of cytokine mRNAs was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In nonstimulated cultures, low (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) and high (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. The pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, whereas TNF-alpha secretion was not elevated. E coli was the most potent inducer followed by B fragilis, S agalactiae, S aureus, and M hominis. Transcripts encoding IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, or IL-10 were elevated in the RT-PCR reactions, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mRNA expression and polypeptide release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. Induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.
TI  - Sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25.
AB  - The complete 50,237-bp DNA sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25 was determined. The plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23S RNA methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pIP501. Genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in Tn5405 from Staphylococcus aureus and in pJH1 from E. faecalis. One interrupted and five complete IS elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pRE25 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pIP501. It is concluded that pRE25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.
TI  - Retrobulbar abscess in a neonate.
AB  
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - Application of the California mastitis test in intramammary Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infections of camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Kenya.
AB  - A study was conducted on 207 lactating camels in six herds in Kenya to evaluate the California mastitis test (CMT) for the detection of intramammary infections (IMIs) caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and to investigate the prevalence of both the pathogens in the camel udder. IMI with S. agalactiae was found in 12% of all camels sampled. IMI with S. aureus was present in 11% of all camels sampled. The herd-level prevalence of IMI varied between 0 and 50% for S. agalactiae and between 0 and 13% for S. aureus. Longitudinal observations over 10-12 months confirmed persistent infections for both pathogens. Observations in one herd suggested that camel pox was a contributing factor in spreading and exacerbating S. agalactiae udder infections.The CMT had quarter-level sensitivities of 77 and 68% for S. agalactiae and S. aureus in camels, respectively. The CMT specificities were 91% for both the pathogens.
TI  - Group B streptococcal disease: from trials and tribulations to triumph and trepidation.
AB  - Group B streptococci garnered attention during the 1970s when they surpassed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to become the principal causes of sepsis in early infancy. During the 1980s, several clinical trials demonstrated that administration of antimicrobial agents during labor could interrupt vertical transmission and prevent invasive disease in the first week of life (i.e., early-onset disease). However, prophylaxis was not widely used during the next 10 years. On the basis of efforts by clinician-researchers, professional organizations, community-based parent advocacy groups, and the public health community, consensus recommendations for group B streptococcal prophylaxis were finally issued in 1996. By the end of 1999, the incidence of early-onset disease in selected counties within the United States had decreased by 70%, and the gap between black and white persons with disease narrowed by 75%. This recent triumph leaves the professional community treading lightly, alert to the need to monitor for unintended consequences that may threaten recent progress.
TI  - Characteristics and management practices associated with milk production in dairy herds in Ohio enrolled in official Dairy Herd Improvement Association programs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine herd characteristics and management practices associated  with milk production in dairy herds enrolled in official Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) programs in Ohio. SAMPLE POPULATION: 186 dairy farms in Ohio. PROCEDURE: All herds in official DHIA programs in 9 counties were invited to participate. Information regarding herd characteristics and management practices was obtained, using a standardized questionnaire. Bulk-tank milk samples were obtained for bacteriologic culture. Official DHIA test-day records were obtained, and associations were identified, using multivariable ANOVA procedures. RESULTS: Of 479 eligible producers, 186 (39%) participated, and consecutive bulk-tank milk samples were available for culture from 172 (36%). Streptococcus agalactiae and Mycoplasma spp were not recovered from bulk-tank milk samples, but Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 64 (37%) herds. Mean (+/- SD) number of lactating cows in participating herds was 97+/-66, with 123 (66%) herds milking < 100 cows. The RHA was significantly associated with number of cows in milk, estimated percentage of herd detected in estrus, reported annual percentage of heifer calves born alive that died before 8 weeks old, percentage days in milk, use of bovine somatotropin during the preceding 2 years, and sex of the person completing the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In this study, the strongest indicator of milk production was number of cows in milk. However, merely adding cows to a herd should not be considered to guarantee increased milk production, because other management traits could be confounded with increased number of cows in a herd.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Development of a rapid and sensitive test for identification of major pathogens in bovine mastitis by PCR.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is the most important source of loss for the dairy industry. A rapid and specific test for the detection of the main pathogens of bovine mastitis is not actually available. Molecular probes reacting in PCR with bacterial DNA from bovine milk, providing direct and rapid detection of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, and Streptococcus uberis, have been developed. Two sets of specific primers were designed for each of these microorganisms and appeared to discriminate close phylogenic bacterial species (e.g., S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae). In addition, two sets of universal primers were designed to react as positive controls with all major pathogens of bovine mastitis. The sensitivities of the test using S. aureus DNA extracted from milk with and without a pre-PCR enzymatic lysis step of bacterial cells were compared. The detection limit of the assay was 3.125 x 10(2) CFU/ml of milk when S. aureus DNA was extracted with the pre-PCR enzymatic step compared to 5 x 10(3) CFU/ml of milk in the absence of the pre-PCR enzymatic step. This latter threshold of sensitivity is still compatible with its use as an efficient tool of diagnosis in bovine mastitis, allowing the elimination of expensive reagents. The two PCR tests avoid cumbersome and lengthy cultivation steps, can be performed within hours, and are sensitive, specific, and reliable for the direct detection in milk of the six most prevalent bacteria causing bovine mastitis.
TI  - Mastitis in lactating camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Afar Region, north-eastern  Ethiopia.
AB  - Quarter milk samples (n = 543) from 152 traditionally managed lactating camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Afar Region, north-eastern Ethiopia were examined to determine the prevalence of camel mastitis and identify its bacterial causes. Out of 152 camels examined, 19 (12.5%) were diagnosed as clinical mastitis cases based on clinical signs and bacteriological examinations. Of the 257 California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarter milk samples 162 (63.0%) yielded pathogenic bacteria. A positive correlation was observed between CMT positive results and presence of major pathogens in camel milk samples. The main mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, and other species of streptococci, Pasteurella haemolytica and E. coli. Results of the present study suggest that mastitis in Afar camels is prevalent, Gram-positive cocci are the major isolates from camel milk samples and the CMT can be used as a screening test for the detection of mastitis in camels.
TI  - Survey of yeast mastitis in dairy herds of small-type farms in the Lublin region, Poland.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to isolate fungi from the quarter milk of cow udders in 9 dairy farms. The samples were collected between May 1996 and April 2000 in the Lublin region. Six hundred and four milk samples collected from the quarters of 172 cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis were examined. Milk samples were plated as soon as possible on blood agar (BA), Mac Conkey agar, aesculin-tallium acetate-crystal violet blood agar, and Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol and gentamicin. Fifty eight (9.6%) of the samples were positive for fungi. All of the fungal isolates were yeasts of the genera Candida, Rhodotorula and Trichosporon. We also isolated Streptococcus agalactiae (4.9%), Str. spp.(6.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci-CNS (36.6%), Escherichia coli (3.5%), other microorganisms (2.6%) and no growth (25.8%).
TI  - Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal causes of bovine mastitis.
AB  - To improve diagnosis of mastitis in dairy cattle, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of the four major bacterial causes of bovine mastitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis. The target sequence was the 16S to 23S rRNA spacer regions. The performance of the assay was examined with 117 milk samples collected from a subclinically infected herd, and the diagnostic specificities and sensitivities of the multiplex PCR were compared with conventional culture. PCR was significantly more sensitive than culture for detection of S. aureus and S. uberis, but there were no significant differences in sensitivities between PCR and culture for the detection of S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae. The results suggest that this multiplex PCR assay could be used as an alternative method in routine diagnosis for rapid, sensitive, and specific simultaneous detection of S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, and S. uberis in milk samples.
TI  - The major bovine mastitis pathogens have different cell tropisms in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells.
AB  - We previously showed that Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered mainly to an elongated cell type, present in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells. Moreover, we showed that this adhesion was mediated by binding to fibronectin. The same in vitro model was used here, to study adhesion of other important mastitis pathogens. Like the S. aureus strains, the Streptococcus dysgalactiae strains adhered mainly to elongated cells, which seemed to be mediated by fibronectin binding. In contrast, Streptococcus uberis strains adhered mainly to cubic cells. Since the cubic cells did not express fibronectin and S. uberis cells bound fibronectin less efficiently, the adhesion of S. uberis cells was independent of fibronectin binding. Streptococcus agalactiae strains adhered poorly to both cell types. The specificity and efficiency of adhesion of Escherichia coli strains was strongly strain dependent. None of the S. agalactiae and E. coli strains tested was able to bind fibronectin efficiently. The results suggest that the different mastitis pathogens have different target cell specificities and use different mechanisms to adhere to cells of the bovine mammary gland.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Production, purification and some properties of Bac201, a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance produced by Staphylococcus aureus AB201.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus AB201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as Bac201, that was inhibitory to Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. It was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (BioSil-SEC-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C4). The native Bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kDa as determined by GF HPLC. Fraction-I (native Bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. The purification of Bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. The purified Bac201 migrated as single band on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kDa. Bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of pH (2.5-10). The amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and alanine (8%) residues. Further results showed that Bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent loss of membrane permeability.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. Chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Five strains of Hemolytic streptococci group B (GBS) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: Hemolytic streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Lactobacillus species. Bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. Consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). In experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. All strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group A, S. aureus and S. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
TI  - Efficacies of chlorine dioxide and lodophor teat dips during experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - We tested two postmilking teat dips for efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae using experimental challenge procedures recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The chlorine dioxide teat dip that contained 0.7% sodium chlorite reduced the number of new intramammary infections (IMI) caused by Staph. aureus by 86.6% and reduced new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 88.4%. The 0.5% iodophor teat dip reduced the number of new IMI caused by Staph. aureus by 92.9% and reduced the number of new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 43.4%. Teat skin and teat end conditions were evaluated before and after the study, and no deleterious effects were noted among dipped quarters compared with undipped control quarters for either teat dip.
TI  - Spinal epidural abscesses in children: a 15-year experience and review of the literature.
AB  - We reviewed medical records and laboratory and diagnostic evaluations for 8 pediatric patients with spinal epidural abscesses who were treated during the last 15 years at our institution. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 5 of 8 epidural abscesses, including 2 abscesses with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Unusual isolates were group B Streptococcus in a patient with chronic vesicouretral reflux associated with the posterior urethral valves and Aspergillus flavus in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia. An analysis incorporating our results and a review of the English-language literature about abscesses in children and adults revealed differences related to age. Abscesses in children were more posterior in epidural location, had greater spinal column extension, and were associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than were abscesses in adults. Magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic procedure of choice; however, radionuclide bone scans should be considered for associated distant osteomyelitis in children. Prompt diagnosis and combined medical and surgical treatment remain the cornerstones for the prevention of adverse outcomes.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Herd characteristics and management practices associated with bulk-tank somatic cell counts in herds in official Dairy Herd Improvement Association programs in Ohio.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify herd characteristics and management practices associated with bulk-tank somatic cell counts (BTSCC) in dairy herds in Ohio enrolled in official Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) programs. SAMPLE POPULATION: 186 dairies in Ohio. PROCEDURE: All herds in official DHIA programs in 9 counties were asked to participate. Extensive information regarding herd characteristics and management practices was obtained, using a standardized questionnaire. Bulk-tank milk samples were requested from all participating herds for bacterial culture. Official DHIA test-day records for January 1997 were obtained from all herds enrolled in official DHIA programs in the 9 counties. Potential associations were identified, using multivariable ANOVA. RESULTS: Participation was 186 of 479 (39%) herds. Streptococcus agalactiae and Mycoplasma spp were not isolated from bulk-tank milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 64 of 172 (37%) of the herds. The BTSCC were inversely associated with peak daily milk production, postmilking teat disinfection, percentage of eligible cows in the herd detected in estrus, and directly related to the extent to which BTSCC was perceived as a herd problem during the preceding 2 years. Type of housing for nonlactating cows and product used for treatment of nonlactating cows also were significantly associated with BTSCC. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Consideration of herd characteristics and implementation of management practices associated with BTSCC could result in increased milk yield and production of milk with lower BTSCC.
TI  - Influence of modified natural or synthetic surfactant preparations on growth of bacteria causing infections in the neonatal period.
AB  - Connatal bacterial pneumonia is common in neonates. Animal studies and initial clinical reports indicate that surfactant dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of severe neonatal pneumonia. Since respiratory distress syndrome and connatal pneumonia may be difficult to differentiate in the first hours of life, neonates with respiratory failure due to bacterial infections might receive surfactant. Under such conditions surfactant components might be catabolized by bacteria and promote bacterial growth. We therefore investigated the influence of three modified natural (Curosurf, Alveofact, and Survanta) and two synthetic (Exosurf and Pumactant) surfactant preparations on the growth of bacteria frequently cultured from blood or tracheal aspirate fluid in the first days of life. Group B streptococci (GBS), Staphyloccocus aureus, and Escherichia coli were incubated in a nutrient-free medium (normal saline) for 5 h at 37 degrees C, together with different surfactants at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 20 mg/ml. With the exception of E. coli, incubation in saline alone led to a variable decrease in CFU. In the presence of Alveofact, Exosurf, and Pumactant the decline in bacterial numbers was less marked than in saline alone. Curosurf was bactericidal in a dose-dependent fashion for GBS and had a strong negative impact on the growth of a GBS subtype that lacked the polysaccharide capsule. In contrast, Survanta (10 and 20 mg/ml) significantly promoted the growth of E. coli, indicating that surfactant components may actually serve as nutrients. We conclude that bacterial growth in different surfactant preparations is influenced by microbial species and the composition and dose of the surfactant. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind our findings and to evaluate the effects of surfactant on bacterial growth in vivo.
TI  - Factors prior to dry period associated with high and low levels of cow milk somatic cell counts in next lactation.
AB  - Data from a randomized controlled field study of selective dry cow therapy were used in which 686 cows had been allocated to 2 control groups (sampling only or placebo) or 2 therapy groups. Possible factors from previous lactation were assessed in determining their association with the probability of 'failure', designated as a cow milk somatic cell count (CMSCC) of greater than 399,000 per ml in geometric mean of several measurements during subsequent lactation. Success cows were those with a CMSCC of less than 200,000 per ml. For our analyses, this targeted 187 success cows and 186 failure cows. Therapy was given as a total dose of 400,000 IU penicillin and 100 mg neomycin per infected quarter as dry cow preparation once, or as a lactation formula with a total dose of 1.2 million IU penicillin and 1,200 mg dihydrostreptomycin per infected quarter during a 1-week period. Significant factors in the predictive model for success included therapy, low level of CMSCC (geometric mean of the 3 last tests) in previous lactation, low level of CMSCC (weighted by daily milk yield mean) in the herd, young cows, and not having had a case of treatment for chronic clinical mastitis. Additional information on the probability of failure in treated and untreated cows can be predicted by number of quarters infected with Staphylococcus aureus approximately 1.5 months before drying off. The models derived are considered for use as tools in selective treatment and culling decisions.
TI  - [National multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens. Spanish Study Group on Moxifloxacin].
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.

TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. CD14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including LPS. However, little is known of monocyte receptors involved in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. To identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mAbs and TNF-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. Human serum and anti-CD14 Abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, TNF-alpha responses to the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including group A and B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Complement receptor type III (CR3 or CD18/CD11b) Abs prevented TNF-alpha release induced by heat-killed group A or B streptococci. In contrast, the same Abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus. Using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of TNF-alpha release was produced by Abs to CD11c, one of the subunits of CR4. To confirm these blocking Ab data, IL-6 release was measured in CR3-, CR4-, or CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. Accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate IL-6 production (p < 0.05) in CR3 but not CD14 or CR4 transfectants. In contrast, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus induced IL-6 release in CR4 but not CR3 or CD14 transfectants. Collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as CR3 and CR4, may be involved in cytokine responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, CD14 may play a more important role in responses to whole Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive ones.
TI  - Udder health and risk factors for subclinical mastitis in organic dairy farms in  Switzerland.
AB  - 1+ were submitted for somatic cell counting (SCC), bacteriological examination and to test for antibiotic susceptibility. The SCC and germ-cell counts of monthly bulk-tank milk samples were available through Dairy Inspection and Advisory Services and milk production data of 567 herd-book cows were available from breeding associations. Possible individual and environmental predictors of subclinical mastitis were identified using logistic models adjusted for clustering of the data at herd and cow levels. Data were analyzed separately for cows from 7 to 100 and from 101 to 305 days post partum. Prevalences of subclinical mastitis at the quarter level were 21.2% for lactation period 7-100 days and 34.5% for 101-305 days post partum. The geometric mean SCC in bulk-tank milk samples was 85.6x10(3)cells/ml. Samples at 7-100 and 101-305 days post partum were positive for Staphylococcus aureus in 16.0 and 7.4%, for coagulase-negative Staphylococci in 51.5 and 50.6%, for Streptococcus agalactiae in 0.0 and 0.8%, for other Streptococci in 19.4 and 15.6%, for E. coli in 1.0 and 0.4%, and for Corynebacterium bovis in 25.7 and 45.1%, respectively. Risks of subclinical mastitis increased significantly with increasing days post partum and advancing age of cow. Cows that were sampled when staying in alpine dairies had considerably higher risks of subclinical mastitis than cows staying in home barns. Significantly lower risks of subclinical mastitis were observed in farms where CMT was performed regularly as a control measure. Bacteria in milk from cows with mastitis exhibited antibiotic resistance at a comparable frequency as found previously in conventional farms.
TI  - Multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  - An optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, Clostridium bifermentans and C. sordellii, and Prevotella bivia. Serial electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. Four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. Thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. The analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. The method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of S. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. Since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Acquired antibiotic resistance in Madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in Madagascar. Testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar in Antananarivo between October 1997 and October 1998. Antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. Results were read according to the criteria of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology. Preliminary findings documented a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin G and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of Staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which 80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of Escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of Shigella sp. respectively were resistant. Second-line antibiotics including penicillin M, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an effective alternative. Newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. Although not representative of Madagascar as a whole, the findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - The extracellular hyaluronidase gene (hylA) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Group A streptococci produce an extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase) which may be associated with the spread of the organism during infection. The gene for this hyaluronidase (hylA) encodes an 868 amino acid protein with a molecular size of 99636 Da. Cleavage of the proposed signal peptide results in an extracellular protein of 95941 Da. Comparison with other bacterial hyaluronidases indicates strong similarities to the genes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. A region internal to the hylA gene was amplified from all 175 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested suggesting a widespread distribution of the gene.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus species isolated from infectious skin diseases.
AB  - During the period from January of 1995 to June of 1998, 27 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 25 cases of infectious skin diseases including secondary infections, impetigo, phlegmone, and paronychia. The rate of beta-hemolytic streptococci among all kinds of the isolates was found to be similar during those 4 years, ranging from 3.5% to 5.6%. Staphylococcus aureus were found to coexist with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 20 (80%) out of 25 cases. beta-hemolytic streptococci were also often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-positive rods, or other species. Twelve cases (48%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. Most beta-hemolytic streptococci showed high susceptibilities to all antimicrobials tested; however S. agalactiae showed no susceptibility to gentamicin. The evaluation of characteristics of Streptococcus species is very important for selecting the right antimicrobial agents and the proper term of chemotherapy.
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.004-8.56), Apgar score after 1 min (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.36-12.12). There was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.07-17.40). Funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. The histological examination of the umbilical cord can be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Characteristics in adherence of streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from various infective skin lesions: serum IgA decreases adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes but not Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We characterized adherence of streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various infective skin lesions in terms of hydrophobicity, negative charge, tube adherence, slime production, and influence on adherence to coverslips by plasma and serum immunoglobulins. High hydrophobicity was more frequently observed in Streptococcus pyogenes strains than in Streptococcus agalactiae strains (P < 0.01) and S. aureus strains (P < 0.001) and slime production was more frequently observed in S. agalactiae strains than in S. pyogenes strains (P < 0.05). Serum IgA decreased adherence to coverslips of S. pyogenes strains but not that of S. aureus strains.
TI  - Semiquantitative bacterial observations with group B streptococcal vulvovaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Group B streptococcal (GBS) vulvovaginitis is a poorly-delineated clinical entity. The purpose of this study is to report semiquantitative data from four cases of GBS vulvovaginitis and to comment on their significance in terms of the in vitro inhibitory capabilities of GBS. METHODOLOGY: Four patients whose clinical presentations were consistent with GBS vulvovaginitis, from whom GBS was isolated and for whom semi-quantitative as well as qualitative microbiologic data existed, were identified. RESULTS: To produce vulvovaginitis, GBS must be at a high multiplicity (10(8) CFU/g of vaginal fluid). Single coisolates were identified in three of the four cases (two cases of Escherichia coli and one case of Staphylococcus aureus). Group B streptococcus does not inhibit either of these bacteria in vitro. CONCLUSION: When the growth requirements for the demonstration of in vitro inhibition for GBS or lack thereof are met in vivo, the in vivo observations are consistent with those projected from the in vitro data.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Comparison of seven antibiotic treatments with no treatment for bacteriological efficacy against bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Milk culture results were retrospectively reviewed from 9007 cases of subclinical mastitis affecting cows housed in dairy herds located in New York and northern Pennsylvania. Cases included in this analysis had at least one mastitis pathogen isolated from the initial milk sample, were recultured within 1 mo, had permanent cow identification, and had records of whether mastitis was treated with an antibiotic or no treatment at all. Overall bacteriological cure rate for 21 mastitis pathogens was 68% (6097 of 9007). Antibiotic treated cases had a higher cure rate (75%) than did untreated cases (65%). Antibiotic treatments that significantly differed from the untreated cure rate of 65% were amoxicillin (82%), erythromycin (76%), cloxacillin (73%), and pirlimycin (44%). Cure rates for antibiotic treatments with cephapirin, hetacillin, or penicillin did not differ from the untreated cure rate. Agents for which some antibiotics were associated with increased cure rates compared with no treatment were Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci other than Strep. agalactiae, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The antibiotic most commonly associated with higher cure rates was amoxicillin. Most of the 21 mastitis agents showed no difference in bacteriologic cure rates between any of the 7 antibiotic treatments and no treatment.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of the CAMP factor gene (cfa) of group A  streptococci.
AB  - The CAMP reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (CAMP factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C (beta-toxin). Group A streptococci (GAS [Streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered CAMP negative, and this reaction commonly has been used to distinguish GAS from Streptococcus agalactiae. We here provide evidence that GAS possess this gene and produce an extracellular CAMP factor capable of participating in a positive CAMP reaction. The S. pyogenes CAMP factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the CAMP factor genes from S. agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. This gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in Escherichia coli. Recombinant clones of E. coli expressing cfa secreted an active CAMP factor. The deduced 28.5-kDa protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. The cfa gene is widely spread among GAS: 82 of 100 clinical GAS isolates produced a positive CAMP reaction. Of the CAMP-negative strains, 17 of the 18 GAS strains contained the cfa gene. Additionally, CAMP activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups C, M, P, R, and U. The cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in Escherichia coli and gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under control of the cfa promoter. These cfa promoter-lacZ fusions were introduced into S. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. The results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the CAMP factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups A, B, C, G, M, P, R, and U.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Determinants of success or failure in the elimination of major mastitis pathogens in selective dry cow therapy.
AB  - Discriminant factors for the elimination of major pathogens (mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae) were identified from a randomized, double-blind, field study on dry cow therapy. From an original study of 686 cows, 269 fulfilled the criteria for this analysis: 93 from the control group, 83 from group C (treated with Benestermycin vet. "LEO") and 93 from group D (treated with Leocillin with Dihydrostreptomycin vet. "LEO"). A "success" cow was defined as a cow that had all quarters healthy in two tests after dry period. Isolation of a major pathogen (mainly Staph. aureus or Strep. dysgalactiae) in any quarter in both samples after the dry period was defined as "failure." Better elimination was associated with short-acting preparations (therapy D) rather than with long-acting therapy C (odds ratio = 0.32), as was a smaller mean value of the last three composite milk somatic cell counts (CMSCC) before dry cow therapy. Cows with a major pathogen in the right hind quarter at drying off or at least one case of acute clinical mastitis during the previous lactation were more likely to have a major pathogen in the next lactation (odds ratio = 4.1 and 3.6, respectively). Young cows without major pathogens at drying off should not be recommended for dry cow therapy, and cows with high CMSCC should be considered for culling if their profiles also show previous acute clinical mastitis in combination with generally high CMSCC and low cure rates in the herd.
TI  - [Udder health on dairy farms. 1. Results of a longitudinal study on 300 Dutch farms].
AB  - Udder health was studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three categories according to the bulk milk somatic cell count. In all herds, lactating cows were housed in a free-stall barn during the winter. All herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300,000 and 900,000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the Holstein-Friesian or Dutch Friesian breeds. The incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150,000), middle (151,000 to 250,000), or high (251,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, or Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories. The differences in bulk milk somatic cell count between the categories could be explained by the management practices studied. The incidence of clinical E. coli mastitis was mostly related to housing, hygiene, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors that were related to the bulk milk somatic cell count and to factors of which it was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, milking technique, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. Two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated. The first group was identified as 'Clean and Accurate', and the second group as 'Quick and Dirty'. The relationship between these two groups and bulk milk somatic cell count category was high. However, the relationship between the two groups and the incidence of clinical mastitis was weak.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of G1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  - G1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in Cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. A compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. We tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. The following are MIC50, MIC90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: E. coli 16, 16, 4 32; Klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; Citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; Enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; Enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; Staphylococcus aureus 8, 16, 4-16; Streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; Streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; Candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; Candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; Candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. MIC values appear lower for Gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. G1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (PNU-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  - Alexomycin (PNU-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by Streptomyces arginensis. MICs against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. Alexomycin was active against Gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL), as well as Enterococcus species (95 strains; MIC90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/mL), and generally inactive against Gram-negative aerobes. Alexomycin had more potent activity against Streptococcus bovis (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), S. agalactiae (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL), Corynebacterium species (MIC90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/mL), and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL). Alexomycin activity was limited against Bacillus species (MIC90, 1 microgram/mL), Neisseria meningiditis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/mL), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/mL), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 32 micrograms/mL). This thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/mL) in Mueller-Hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. Alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - A preliminary survey of antibiotic residues and viable bacteria in milk from three Caribbean Basin countries.
AB  - There is widespread concern about the presence of antimicrobial drugs in milk. The presence of drug residues in milk may have public health implications. Milk samples (n = 25 to 65/country) were collected from bulk tanks and commercial vendors in Barbados, Costa Rica, and Jamaica between February 1996 and August 1997. Bulk tank samples were collected from high milk-producing regions of Jamaica and Costa Rica and from 26 dairy farms in Barbados. Milk pH, bacterial growth (total CFU/ml and the presence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus), and the presence of antimicrobials were determined. Milk samples were tested by a microbial inhibition test (Delvotest-P, Gist-Brocades Food Ingredients, Inc.) to screen for antimicrobial drugs. All positives were retested for the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics after incubating with penicillinase and some positives were identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography-UV. Mean pH values ranged from 6.5 to 6.7. S. aureus was identified in bulk tank samples from Costa Rica (52%), Barbados (44%), and Jamaica (46%). S. agalactiae was identified in bulk tank samples from Costa Rica (28%), Barbados (8 and 16%), and Jamaica (18%). Antimicrobial residues were detected in some bulk tank samples from Barbados (8%) and Jamaica (10%) but not in samples from Costa Rica. All positives in milk from Jamaica and Barbados were determined to be beta-lactams. No residues were detected in pasteurized milk samples from Barbados or ultrahigh-temperature milk from Jamaica. The presence of beta-lactam residues in some of these samples suggests the appropriateness of testing milk prior to processing for consumption.
TI  - Vaccines and diagnostic methods for bovine mastitis: fact and fiction.
AB  - A number of problems are uniquely associated with vaccination of dairy cows for mastitis. One of these is that the number of mastitis pathogens is numerous and heterogeneous. Vaccine efforts have concentrated mainly on the major mastitis pathogens. While at least one S. aureus bacterin has been commercially available for a number of years, no large-scale, independent field trials have been published in refereed journals which support the efficacy of this vaccine. Experimental vaccines for S. aureus composed of pseudocapsule-enriched bacterins supplemented with alpha- and/or beta-toxoids appear promising, but none of these has been commercialized. With S. uberis, some protection against homologous strain challenges was reported recently with a live strain and a bacterin, but other data from the same laboratory showed this vaccine would not protect against heterologous challenge strains. At this time there is only one highly effective vaccine for mastitis, the core-antigen vaccine for coliform mastitis. All of the commercially available vaccines for this indication are bacterins of rough mutants of E. coli strain J5 or Salmonella spp. Preliminary success with an experimental vaccine based on the plasminogen activator of S. uberis is a very different approach for a mastitis vaccine. Little success has been reported with vaccination against other mastitis pathogens. For diagnostic methods, the high somatic cell count, as measured by direct count or indirect assays, remains the cornerstone of mastitis diagnosis. However, for subclinical mastitis, bacterial cell culture is a reliable diagnostic method. Pathogen identification may rely on older biochemical testing methods or newer commercial identification systems, depending on the laboratory budget. ELISA assays also have been used to assess herd infection status. Epidemiologic studies have used DNA fingerprinting and ribotyping, but none of these methods has yet produced an easily utilized commercial format. Within the next decade, additional efficacious vaccines for several of the most common agents for bovine mastitis are likely. A review written at that time then can be more fact than fiction.
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Measurement of antibacterial activities of T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  A, aflatoxin B1 and fumonisin B1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  - Various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. Ten different strains of the genera Escherichia, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Yersinia, Salmonella, Erysipelothrix and Lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), ochratoxin A (OTA), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) were used as representative mycotoxins. The inhibitory effect in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of OTA. T-2 toxin and FB1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. AFB1 affected the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica. The growth rate of Escherichia coli and Salmonella infantis was decreased by FB1. Among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by OTA. Thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. We concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.
TI  - [Antibodies to bacterial antigens and autoantigens in pregnant women with kidney  diseases].
AB  - The levels of antibodies (Ab) to bacterial antigens of gram-negative enterobacteria (Reglicolipid), Streptococcus agalactiae polysaccharide, Staphylococcus aureus teichoic acid, native and denatured DNA and renal proteins in healthy pregnant women and in those with renal pathology (chronic and gestation pyelonephritis) were studied. The study revealed that the combination of an elevated levels of Ab to bacterial antigens with the elevated titers of Ab to DNA and renal proteins is indicative of acute inflammation in kidneys, and but the combination of an elevated levels of Ab bacterial antigens with the low level of Ab to DNA and renal proteins is indicative of healthy carrier state with respect to a given infective agent.
TI  - Effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (NO) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. We studied the antimicrobial properties of NO in concentrations used with inhaled NO therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. DESIGN: In vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without NO exposure. SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. SUBJECTS: In vitro bacterial cultures. INTERVENTIONS: We tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococcus [GBS/Streptococcus agalactiae], Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. Cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of NO (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. After incubation (with or without NO), colony-forming units were counted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was not reduced with the NO concentrations applied. The number of colony-forming units of S. aureus increased at 80 ppm of NO. Growth of S. epidermidis and GBS was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. However, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled NO in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of NO is not to be expected.
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
AB  - A drug susceptibility test of the combination drug TAZ/PIPC, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (PIPC), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. The clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. The results were as follows: 1. In susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ). Of three clinically isolated species from patients, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was treated with TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, methicillin (DMPPC), CTM, CTX, and SBT/CPZ, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for DMPPC. The MICs were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC90 values of TAZ/PIPC against 45 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of Gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC for 28 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC. The MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 31 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Regarding Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 2 strains of S. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTM, and CTX, and the latter was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Of 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of PIPC, SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of H. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of PIPC and SBT/CPZ. While the MIC of TAZ/PIPC against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of SBT/CPZ and smaller than that of PIPC. 2. The results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: TAZ/PIPC was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). No case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. Bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. Adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. Of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Biochemical profile showed an increase in GPT alone and abnormal increases in both GOT and GPT in 1 each out of 21 cases.
TI  - Germicidal activity of a chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide teat dip and a sodium chlorite teat dip during experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Three postmilking teat dips were tested for efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in two separate studies using experimental challenge procedures that were recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The first study evaluated a barrier teat dip product containing chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide as the germicidal agent, and the second study evaluated a sodium chlorite product with a barrier component as well as a sodium chlorite product without a barrier component. The chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide teat dip reduced new intramammary infections (IMI) caused by Staph. aureus by 91.5% and reduced new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 71.7%. The barrier dip containing sodium chlorite reduced new IMI caused by Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae by 41.0 and 0%, respectively. The nonbarrier dip containing sodium chlorite reduced new IMI caused by Staph. aureus by 65.6% and reduced new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 39.1%. Teat skin and teat end conditions were evaluated before and after the second study; no deleterious effects among dipped quarters compared with control quarters were noted for the two sodium chlorite products.
TI  - Partial budget of the discounted annual benefit of mastitis control strategies.
AB  - The objective of this study was to rank the benefits associated with various mastitis control strategies in simulated herds with intramammary infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. other than Strep. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Escherichia coli. The control strategies tested were prevention, vaccination for E. coli, lactation therapy, and dry cow antibiotic therapy. Partial budgets were based on changes caused by mastitis control strategies from the mean values for milk, fat, and protein yields of the control herd and the number of cows that were culled under a fixed mastitis culling criterion. Each annual benefit (dollars per cow per year) of a mastitis control strategy was compared with the revenue for the control herd and was calculated under two different milk pricing plans (3.5% milk fat and multiple-component pricing), three net replacement costs, and three prevalences of pathogen-specific intramammary infection. Twenty replicates of each control strategy were run with SIMMAST (a dynamic discrete event stochastic simulation model) for 5 simulated yr. Rankings of discounted annual benefits differed only slightly according to milk pricing plans within a pathogen group but differed among the pathogen groups. Differences in net replacement costs for cows culled because of mastitis did not change the ranking of control strategies within a pathogen group. Both prevention and dry cow therapy were important mastitis control strategies. For herds primarily infected with environmental pathogens, strategies that included vaccination for mastitis caused by E. coli dominated strategies that did not include vaccination against this microorganism.
TI  - Azithromycin. A review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. Pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. In children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. These standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. Azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. Azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. Skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. Although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.
TI  - Identification of two genes, cpsX and cpsY, with putative regulatory function on  capsule expression in group B streptococci.
AB  - Two divergently transcribed open reading frames: cpsX and cpsY separated by a common regulatory region was identified upstream of the cpsA-D genes involved in polysaccharide capsule biosynthesis in group B streptococci (GBS). We suggest that these genes are involved in the regulation of capsule expression in GBS, since the CpsX protein shares sequence similarities with LytR of Bacillus subtilis, an attenuator of transcription while CpsY has similarity to a wide variety of members of the LysR family of transcriptional regulators. No deletions, insertions, DNA rearrangements, or apparent differences were discovered in the postulated regulatory genes when the gene region was compared in GBS with different capsule phenotypes. Thus, other yet unidentified gene loci may control capsule phase variation in GBS.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - A new ketolide, HMR 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  - HMR 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. The effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance was tested in a lacZ reporter system under control of several ermAM-like attenuator variants. For one constitutively resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacZ were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pJIM2246 and the plasmid was introduced into Staphylococcus aureus RN4220. For the wild-type attenuators, HMR 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart RU 6652 and erythromycin. As expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant S. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. For one S. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermAM methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced. For streptococci, the activity of HMR 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. The weak inducer activity of HMR 3004 explained its activity against inducibly MLSB-resistant S. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant E. faecalis.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - Design and validation of a dynamic discrete event stochastic simulation model of  mastitis control in dairy herds.
AB  - A dynamic stochastic simulation model for discrete events, SIMMAST, was developed to simulate the effect of mastitis on the composition of the bulk tank milk of dairy herds. Intramammary infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. other than Strep. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were modeled as were the milk, fat, and protein test day solutions for individual cows, which accounted for the fixed effects of days in milk, age at calving, season of calving, somatic cell count (SCC), and random effects of test day, cow yield differences from herdmates, and autocorrelated errors. Probabilities for the transitions among various states of udder health (uninfected or subclinically or clinically infected) were calculated to account for exposure, heifer infection, spontaneous recovery, lactation cure, infection or cure during the dry period, month of lactation, parity, within-herd yields, and the number of quarters with clinical intramammary infection in the previous and current lactations. The stochastic simulation model was constructed using estimates from the literature and also using data from 164 herds enrolled with Quality Milk Promotion Services that each had bulk tank SCC between 500,000 and 750,000/ml. Model parameters and outputs were validated against a separate data file of 69 herds from the Northeast Dairy Herd Improvement Association, each with a bulk tank SCC that was > or = 500,000/ml. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all input parameters for control herds. Using the validated stochastic simulation model, the control herds had a stable time average bulk tank SCC between 500,000 and 750,000/ml.
TI  - Clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of human T-lymphotrophic virus type I-associated infective dermatitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define the clinical and laboratory features associated with infective dermatitis (ID) and confirm its association with human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I). DESIGN: A case series of patients with ID were compared with patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), which is an important disease in the differential diagnosis of ID. SETTING: Patients were recruited from dermatology and pediatric clinics at the University Hospital of the West Indies and the Bustamante Children's Hospital, Kingston, Jamaica. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and laboratory features of patients with AD were compared with those of patients with ID. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients older than 1 1/2 years diagnosed as having ID (n=50) and AD (n=35) were enrolled based on clinical findings. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients with ID and AD were 6.9 and 7.8 years, respectively. Histologically, both diseases were predominantly chronic dermatitis with propensity for skin colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci; however, the distribution of sites of skin involvement differed. Infection with HTLV-I was the most distinguishing feature among patients with ID, with seropositive results in 100%; only 5 (14%) of the 35 patients with AD had results seropositive for HTLV-I. Infective dermatitis was further characterized by dermatopathic lymphadenitis in 16 (67%) of 24 patients with palpable nodes. Anemia, lymphocytosis, and low albumin and elevated serum globulin levels were more prevalent among patients with ID. Significant elevations of IgA, IgD, and IgG levels were observed among patients with ID compared with those with AD. However, both patients with AD and those with ID had levels of IgD and IgE elevated above the normal range. T-cell subsets among patients with ID revealed T-cell activation with a high percentage of HLA-DR antigen positivity, elevated CD4 (2.4 x 10(9)/L) and CD8 (1.4 x 10(9)/L) cell counts, with an increased CD4/CD8 ratio of 1:73. CONCLUSION: Infective dermatitis is a distinct clinical entity associated with HTLV-I, which plays a role in the pathogenesis and immune perturbations observed.
TI  - [Mastitis Panel meeting 14 May 1997. Treatment of subclinical mastitis during lactation].
AB  
TI  - Incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell counts.
AB  - Incidence of clinical mastitis was studied in 274 herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell count (SCC). Mean incidence rate of clinical mastitis was 0.278, 0.257, and 0.252 cases per 365 cow-days at risk in herds with low (< or = 150,000), medium (150,000 to 250,000), and high (250,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk SCC, respectively. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis was not different among the three categories. Variance in the incidence of clinical mastitis among herds increased as bulk milk SCC decreased. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or Pseudomonas spp., occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk SCC. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk SCC. Systemic signs of illness caused by clinical mastitis occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk SCC. Both overall culling rate and culling rate for clinical mastitis were not different among groups catergorized by bulk milk SCC. In herds with a high bulk milk SCC, however, more cows that produced milk with a high SCC were culled. In herds with a low bulk milk SCC, more cows were culled for teat lesions, milkability, udder shape, fertility, and character than were cows in herds with a high bulk milk SCC. In herds with a low bulk milk SCC, cows were also culled more for export and production reasons.
TI  - Epidemiological studies of clinical and subclinical ovine mastitis in Awassi sheep in northern Jordan.
AB  - Forty-six Awassi sheep flocks selected by stratified random sampling were subjected to a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of intramammary infections, to assess the influence of flock size and parity on the prevalence of somatic cell count (SCC) and to identify major udder pathogens. Of the 3472 udder halves examined, 29.8% had over 10(6) SCC/ml and 0.03% had dry teats due to chronic mastitis. Flocks with 30-49 milking ewes (small flock size) were much younger (P < 0.001) than flocks with 50-99 ewes (medium) and flocks with > or = 100 ewes (large). Pairwise analysis of the InSCC of both halves of the udders revealed significant mean differences for small and large flock size (P < 0.05), and for medium and large flock size (P < 0.001). Mean InSCC was lower (P < 0.05) in samples obtained from the left half compared with samples of the right half of the udder. Multiparous ewes had higher (P < 0.001) mean InSCC than primiparous ewes. Also, ewes with twin lambs had higher (P < 0.001) mean InSCC in the right half of the udder compared with single-lamb ewes. Samples collected in January (winter) had lower (P < 0.05) mean InSCC compared with samples collected in June. The most common organisms isolated from subclinical mastitis cases were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (17.8%), E. coli (13.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). Of the 46 flocks, 20 were monitored monthly for 9 consecutive months to determine the incidence of clinical mastitis diagnosed by shepherds or/and sheep farmers with major pathogens. The incidence of clinical mastitis (expressed as the number of clinical cases per 100 ewe-months) were 2.1 +/- 1.9 (SD), 1.9 +/- 1.1, and 1.2 +/- 2.1 for small, medium and large flocks size strata, respectively. The overall population estimate was 1.7 +/- 0.02 cases per 100 ewe-months. The most-common clinical isolates were S. aureus (22% of all clinical isolates) and E. coli (14.2%).
TI  - Selecting linear-score distributions for modelling milk-culture results.
AB  - The data for this cross-sectional retrospective study are from surveys of 65 dairy-cattle herds in central New York, USA sampled between February, 1993 and March, 1995. The objective was to identify probability distributions of logarithmically transformed somatic-cell counts (linear score) for use in a simulation model of mastitis and milk quality. Probability density functions were estimated using maximum-likelihood estimators for the linear score of individual-cow composite-milk samples culture negative and culture positive for the pathogens Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus non-agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci for the complete dataset and by bulk-tank somatic-cell count group (< 500,000, > or = 500,000 SCC/ml). Based on the rankings of three goodness-of-fit tests (Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi 2), the Weibull distribution (among the three top-ranking distributions for 14 out of 15 cases) may be used to model the individual-cow linear-score response by culture-result-specific bulk-tank somatic-cell count group. A beta distribution was among the three top-ranking distributions for nine out of 15 culture-result-specific bulk-tank somatic-cell count groups and has a logical relationship to linear score because it is defined on a fixed interval. On the other hand, the normal distribution had a poorer fit than the Weibull and at least two other distributions for all culture negative and coagulase-negative staphylococci samples. We do not assume that the underlying biological processes are fully explained by either Weibull or beta distribution--but modelling the linear score for the above culture results with these distributions provided an adequate fit to the survey data, reduced the need for two-sided truncation that open intervals needed, and had errors that did not appear to be systematically positive or negative.
TI  - Outbreak of mastitis caused by one strain of Staphylococcus aureus in a closed dairy herd.
AB  - The Washington State University dairy experienced an outbreak of intramammary infections (IMI) caused by Staphylococcus aureus during autumn 1993 through summer 1995. The outbreak was believed to be a result of transmission of 1 strain of S aureus in a herd that historically had excellent control of contagious mastitis. Control practices included strict hygiene at time of milking and preferential culling of cows infected with S aureus. Mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae was not found in this herd. Despite excellent control practices, the strain of S aureus caused a new infection rate of approximately 3% of the herd per month. Moreover, a second strain of S aureus, isolated from a cow with mastitis, was introduced into the herd experimentally, and it failed to transmit disease. The outbreak of S aureus mastitis in this herd was eventually controlled by maintaining a program of strict milking time hygiene, by intensifying the program of preferentially culling infected cows, and by segregating cows with S aureus IMI in a separate pen and milking these infected cows last.
TI  - Giving selenium supplements to dairy cows strengthens the inflammatory response to intramammary infection and induces a growth-suppressing effect on mastitis pathogens in whey.
AB  - Supplementing the feed of selenium-deficient diary cows with selenium (Se)-yeast  or selenite at a level of 0.2 p.p.m. induced self-cure of subclinical mastitis; the prevalence of quarters harbouring subclinical mastitis (bacteriological criteria) decreased to about one half during the 8 week supplementation period. Three phenomena became apparent to explain the beneficial effect of selenium on mastitis: 1. The recruitment of phagocytes to the infected milk compartment of the udder was improved due to Se-supplementation; the correlation between infection and the respective inflammatory response, as indicated by the somatic cell count (SCC) and the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity (NAGase) of milk, was poor in selenium-deficient cows. Selenium supplementation significantly improved the correlation; 2. Selenium supplementation induced an unspecified antibacterial activity in milk lactoserum (whey), restricting in vitro growth of the mastitis pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis, bacterial growth rates in whey samples became inversely correlated with the respective blood glutathione peroxidase activities (GSH-Px); and 3. Selenium supplementation had an effect on redox activities and sulfhydryl activities in whey. These changes were correlated with in vitro bacterial growth rates.
TI  - Clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in Ontario. The study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. Lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. Overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during location. Teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. Standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other Streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), Corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other Staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). There was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. Clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in Ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. There is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical mastitis among farms. The majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. Environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of clinical mastitis.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mreA, from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. In PCR assays, total genomic DNA from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into lambda Zap II to construct a library of S. agalactiae genomic DNA. A clone, pAES63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in Escherichia coli was recovered. Deletion derivatives of pAES63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. Studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into E. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. This putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described Mef pump in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent MsrA pump in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Its gene has been designated mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux).
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - Efficacies of teat germicides containing 0.5% chlorhexidine and 1% iodine during  experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Two germicides, one containing 0.5% chlorhexidine and one containing 1% iodine, were tested for efficacy against new intramammary infections (IMI) caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The model for the experimental challenge in the trials that were designed to test the efficacy of the two postmilking teat dips was recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The 0.5% chlorhexidine product reduced the number of new IMI caused by Staph. aureus by 73.2% and reduced the number of new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 53.9%. The 1% iodine product reduced the number of new IMI caused by Staph. aureus by 75.6% and reduced the number of new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 53.5%. In both trials, the incidence of clinical mastitis was also reduced in dipped quarters compared with control quarters. Use of the two teat dips over the trial periods had no effect on the condition of teat skin or teat ends.
TI  - Identification of staphylococcal and streptococcal causes of bovine mastitis using 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is caused mainly by certain Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. The sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions were determined for the nine species which cause mastitis: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus xylosus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. Significant variation was found between the spacer sequences of different species with the lengths of the spacers varying from 240 to 461 bp. Between genera the spacers shared only short conserved regions (8-9 bp) and within genera the sequence identities varied from 53 to 85%. This variation made it possible to construct specific primer pairs for these species and genera. The specificities of these primers were tested with 25 bacterial species and 51 isolates from cattle with clinical mastitis. The DNA-based identification of the mastitis species was mostly successful.
TI  - Bovine mastitis pathogens in New York and Pennsylvania: prevalence and effects on somatic cell count and milk production.
AB  - Milk samples were collected from 108,312 dairy cows during 1601 farm visits made  between January 1991 and June 1995. The herd visits were made by personnel from the Central Laboratory of the Quality Milk Promotion Services at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) to farms located in central New York and northern Pennsylvania. Dairy Herd Improvement Association records were available for 32,978 cows in 327 herds. Intramammary infections, as defined by positive milk cultures, were present in 48.5% of all cows and in 36.3% of cows in herds enrolled in the Dairy Herd Improvement Association. Over 75% of the intramammary infections were caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. other than Strep. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mean days in milk at the time of diagnosis, linear score of the somatic cell count, cost of milk loss per lactation, and milk production effects were calculated for 24 etiologic agents of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Osteoarticular and muscle infectious lesions in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - Between 1988 and 1995, 1832 HIV positive patients were evaluated in our institution. We studied the epidemiologic, immunologic and bacteriologic data, laboratory tests, and X-Ray films in those with musculoskeletal infection. We reviewed twenty-one cases of musculoskeletal infection in twenty patients aged 23-35 years (mean 28,6 years, M:F= 15:5). In all of them risk factor for HIV was intravenous drug abuse. The number of CD4 positive lymphocytes ranged from 0,003 to 0,5 10(9)/l. Staphylococcus aureus was the organism responsible of the infection in twelve cases, all active intravenous drug abusers at the time the diagnosis was done. The remaining causative agents were: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (3 cases), Candida albicans (2 cases), Salmonella subgroup 1 (1 case), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1 case), Pseudomona aeruginosa (1 case) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1 case). Fifteen infections were diagnosed between 1988 and 1991 and 6 between 1992 and 1995. Musculoskeletal infectious lesions in HIV positive patients in our country are related in the majority of cases to intravenous drug abuse. In the last four years due to a National medical health care plan conducted to educate this group of people the number of musculoskeletal infections is decreasing.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Evaluation of two iodophor teat germicides: activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Two germicides containing 0.5 and 1% titratable iodine were tested for efficacy against the development of new intramammary infections (IMI) caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The two trials for postmilking teat dip used a model for experimental challenge that was recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The 0.5% iodine formulation reduced new Staph. aureus IMI by 78.2% and reduced new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 73.2%. The 1% iodine product reduced new Staph. aureus IMI by 43.5% and reduced new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 46.4%. No adverse effects on the condition of teat skin or on teat ends were observed over the course of the trials. At the completion of each trial, the teat skin of dipped quarters was characterized as normal, smooth skin that was free from scales, cracks, or chapping; the teat orifice was characterized as smooth without evidence of irritation.
TI  - Estimation of interdependence among quarters of the bovine udder with subclinical mastitis and implications for analysis.
AB  - Interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. The occurrence of high somatic cell count (SCC) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. For all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. Intramammary infection and high SCC were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. High SCC and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. High SCC in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. Streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. The intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of SCC was 0.47. Corynebacterium bovis and Strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. Analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.
TI  - A prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the Negev area of southern Israel. DESIGN: A prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. Thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. During this period 70,709 births (59% Jews and 41% Bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. One hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in Bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in Jewish neonates (P < 0.001). Twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from Days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between Days 8 and 28. A total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. Fifty-seven of all isolates were Gram-negative organisms (mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and Escherichia coli (16%)). Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. Although E. coli was the most frequently recovered Gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms in nosocomial late onset sepsis. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in late onset sepsis were nosocomial. The incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae was 3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. All cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in Bedouins. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern Israel are similar to those reported in Western Europe and the United States. The incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for Bedouins than for Jewish neonates. The distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern Israel and although Gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, S. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. In southern Israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - The purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (RXM). We measured the MICs of macrolide antibiotics, such as RXM, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), rokitamycin (RKM) and midecamycin (MDM), and other classes of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between October and December in 1994 and 1995. RXM had excellent antibacterial activities for S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Against methicillin sensitive S. epidermidis, RXM activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had MIC > or = 128 micrograms/ml. The activity against S. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of EM, CAM, MDM, and clindamycin. The vast majority of methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. In conclusion, RXM is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus except MRSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis and M. pneumoniae.
TI  - Association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (SCC) of bulk tank milk. DESIGN: Analysis of records. SAMPLE POPULATION: Milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between March 1992 and June 1994. PROCEDURE: Results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk SCC among herds. RESULTS: Prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk SCC. In herds free of S agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of S aureus and Corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. For herds without S agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in SCC and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. Increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced SCC in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had S agalactiae mastitis. In herds with S agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in SCC. Only use of sodium chlorite-lactic acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in SCC in herds without S agalactiae mastitis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Important factors associated with bulk tank milk SCC were prevalence of S agalactiae and S aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area, and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.
TI  - [Infectious bursitis: study of 40 cases in the pre-patellar and olecranon regions].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Septic bursitis usually affects subcutaneous localized bursae such the prepatellar and elbow bursae. This condition is infrequently reported in the spanish medical literature. The aim of this report was to study patients suffering from septic bursitis with regard to predisposing conditions, the causative agents, therapy and clinical outcome. METHOD: A retrospective study was undertaken in patients with infectious bursitis attended in the Service of Rheumatology of the POVISA Medical Centre (Vigo) and Juan Canalejo Hospital (La Coruna), Spain, from january 1989 to january 1995. The diagnosis of septic bursitis was confirmed with positive bursal fluid cultures in all cases. RESULTS: We recovered forty cases of infectious bursitis (23 olecranon bursitis and 17 prepatellar bursitis). Most patients were male (80%), and patient mean age was 52 years (range: 14-94). The most common predisposing factors to bacterial infection were steroid therapy (15%) and alcoholism (8%), in addition to cutaneous lesions associated with occupational or recreational trauma (55%). Prepatellar septic bursitis was associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation with fever (71% vs 48%), leukocytosis (76% vs 52%), cellulitis (59% vs 48%) and positive blood cultures (25% vs 0%). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 87.5% of bursal fluid aspirations, the other etiologic microrganism were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Streptococcus agalactiae (2 cases) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 case). The majority of patients (80%) required initial intravenous therapy of which average duration was 11 days (range: 5-21 days). Successful resolution of septic bursitis without open surgical drainage was seen in 38 patients (95%) and there ware no functional impairment, serious complications or recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with septic bursitis suffered systemic and/or local predisposing illness. S. aureus is the commonest pathogen. Prepatellar septic bursitis is associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation and bacteremia. Usually, the prompt and proper antibiotic therapy make innecessary surgical drainage.
TI  - Increase of staphylococci in neonatal septicaemia: a fourteen-year study.
AB  - All cases of neonatal septicaemia during 1981-94 were studied at Orebro Medical Centre Hospital, Sweden. One hundred and thirty-two children fulfilled laboratory and clinical criteria for neonatal septicaemia and were included. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41), Group B streptococcus (GBS) (n = 32) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (n = 27) were the dominating aetiologies. The annual incidence of septicaemia increased significantly, from 2.3 cases during the first 7-year period to 3.3 per 1000 live births during 1988-94. This increase was caused by S. aureus and CoNS, which mainly affected premature children and had an onset more than 48 h after delivery. GBS, on the other hand, slightly decreased and affected full-term children within 48 h. The overall mortality was 11%. CoNS isolated during the latter 7-year period were more resistant to antibiotics than those isolated during 1981-87; resistance to methicillin increased from 14 to 45% and to gentamicin from 0 to 20%. These changes in aetiology and antibiotic susceptibility should be considered when selecting antibiotic treatment in neonatal septicaemia.

AB  
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for Butyrivibrios.
AB  - As a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid.
TI  - Diversity of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus ribotypes recovered from New York dairy herds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a reference database for characterization of bovine Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae strains by automated ribotyping and to use it to assess the discriminatory power of this typing procedure and the geographic distribution of Sta aureus and Str agalactiae strains in New York state dairy herds. SAMPLE POPULATION: 22 commercial dairy herds. PROCEDURE: Isolates of Sta aureus and Str agalactiae from bovine milk were identified by standard bacteriologic procedures, then typed by automated ribotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was tested in vitro. Two indicators made from the data were percentage of farms with multiple ribotypes and percentage of single ribotypes found in several geographic regions. Standard bacteriologic diagnosis, automated ribotyping, and determination of antibiograms (Kirby-Bauer method) also were done. RESULTS: Of 50 Sta aureus and 44 Str agalactiae isolates from composite milk samples of 12 and 10 herds, respectively, 18 and 14 ribotypes, respectively, were identified. The discriminatory power of automated ribotyping was approximately 0.96 (Hunter-Gaston's formula). A higher percentage of herds with Sta aureus had multiple ribotypes. The most common Sta aureus ribotypes tended to have broader geographic distribution. Some Sta aureus ribotypes were significantly associated with antibiotic resistance profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Automated ribotyping appears to characterize bovine strains of bacteria associated with intramammary infections with a high discriminatory index. Potential applications include identification of strains that appear to have broad geographic distribution suggesting interfarm transfer, discrimination between recurrent versus new intramammary infections (ie, for control of Str agalactiae and Sta aureus), and evaluation of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [A method for estimating the prevalence of mammary Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae infections in herds based on an examination of bulk milk samples].
AB  - Parallel quantitative determination executed in 92 herds at 107 sampling dates was focused on the counts of major pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae) in bulk milk samples and on the prevalence of the above pathogens in a herd by examination of individual milk samples. The counts of main pathogens were also determined in terms of quantity in rinsing water before milking and in bulk samples in 5 herds with pipeline milking. Tab. I shows the qualitative analysis of the relation. Sensitivity of the method is satisfactory for the pathogens observed (95% and 91%, resp.), but method is less specific for Staph. aureus (67% against 92% Str. agalactiae). Figs. 1 and 2 show coordinate graphs of the results obtained while Figs. 3 and 4 document the distribution of frequency of the particular values in data sets. The values do not exhibit normal distribution (P < 0.01). Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation of bulk milk and individual examinations amounted to 0.823 and 0.900 for Staph. aureus and Str. agalactiae, respectively. Four mathematical models were tested in the course of quantitative analysis, describing the relation between bulk milk examination and individual examination: (1) linear regression, (2) linear regression with fixed starting point, (3) logarithmic regression and (4) irrational function. A model based on the equation of irrational function (4) was found to be best: y = a + bx + c square root of x + k +/- a1 + i(t)c1 square root of x + k1. Tab. II shows the parameters of the equation for examined microorganisms. Correlation coefficients for the above equation are r = 0.733 and r = 0.842 for Staph. aureus and Str. agalactiae, respectively. Prediction curves (Figs. 5 to 8) and confidence regions of prediction curves were also determined for the best model, and a prediction table was constructed (Tab. III). It was confirmed that the milking machines were not a significant source of direct contamination of bulk milk samples with the examined pathogens (Tab. V).
TI  - [Federal investigations on the distribution and in vitro resistance of udder pathogenic bacteria in the milk of cows with subclinical mastitis].
AB  - 1644 quarter milk samples of 948 dairy cows with subclinical mastitis, collected  from 63 veterinary practices all over Germany origined by 262 livestocks with problems in udder health were examined semiquantitatively by "Aulendorfer Mastitistest" for cell count and additionally bacteriologically. Potentially udder pathogenic bacteria were tested for in vitro-sensitivity to penicillin G, ampicillin, oxacillin, cefacetril, tylosin, neomycin, gentamicin, polymyxin B and enrofloxacin. 24.5% of all tested milk samples were bacteriologically negative. In 35.3% of the bacteriological positive milk samples Staphylococcus (S) aureus was detected. Enterococci, Streptococcus (Sc.) uberis, Sc. dysgalactiae and Sc. agalactiae were found in 8.9%, 8.2%, 8.1% and 4.9% of all positive milk samples, respectively. G-streptococci were found only occasionally. Apathogenic bacteria like coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, aerobic bacilli and coryneforms were detected in 45.0% of all positive milk samples. Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and other coliforms) were isolated in 3.3% of all cases and should be considered as insignificant for the subclinical mastitis of dairy cows in Germany. Against S. aureus cefacetril and oxacillin were mostly effective in vitro, whereas penicillin G was ineffective because 40% of these bacteria are penicillinase-positive. Streptococci and enterococci were mostly sensitive to cefacetril, oxacillin, penicillin G and ampicillin. Concerning the distribution of bacteria regional differences were recognized. Regional differences concerning in vitro-sensitivity were negligible. The results are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from Propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. The gene was isolated on an EcoRI-generated 3-kb piece of DNA. Expression was less in Escherichia coli than in P. acnes; in E. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. The gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kDa. Amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. The leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.
TI  - Frequency, risk factors, and outcome for bacteremia after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine bacteremias after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with respect to incidence, outcome, and risk factors. Patients undergoing PTCA from January 1990 through April 1994 were studied; during this period a total of 4,217 PTCAs were performed in 3,473 patients. With use of predefined clinical and microbiologic criteria, bacteremias were divided into 3 categories according to the relation to the PTCA procedure: PTCA-related, unrelated, and indeterminate. Ninety-one patients with at least 1 positive blood culture during a 7-week period after PTCA were identified. The bacteremia was classified as unrelated to the PTCA procedure in 32 patients, PTCA-related in 27, and indeterminant in the remaining 32 patients. The attack rate of PTCA-related bacteremia during the 52-month period was 0.64%. The most common organisms causing PTCA-related bacteremia were Staphylococcus aureus (14 patients), coagulase-negative staphylococci (9 patients) and group B streptococci (6 patients). Septic complications, which included femoral artery mycotic aneurysm, septic arthritis, and septic thrombosis, occurred in 10 patients (0.24%). Independent risk factors for PTCA-related bacteremia included duration of procedure (odds ratio [OR] 2.9; p = 0.04), number of catheterizations at the same site (OR 4.0; p = 0.015), difficult vascular access (OR 14.9; p = 0.007), arterial sheath in place > 1 day (OR 6.8; p = 0.025), congestive heart failure (OR 43.3; p = 0.002). Thus, PTCA-related bacteremia is an infrequent complication of PTCA but can be associated with significant morbidity, particularly when the infecting organism is S. aureus. Four of the 5 risk factors for PTCA-related bacteremia appear to correlate directly with increased vascular injury or maintenance of the arterial entry for the procedure.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - [Validation of TKT medium for detection of Streptococcus agalactiae in bulk milk  samples].
AB  - A selective medium for quantitative determination of Streptococcus agalactiae in  bulk milk samples was tested. Among the medium bases, Edwards medium (EW) supplemented with 6 to 9% (v/v) of carefully washed sheep erythrocytes was proved to be best (Tab. V). The production of sphingomyelinasis C (BHE, Tab. II) or D (COREX, Tab. I) as a supplement supporting the formation of specific hemolytic zones in the medium, was tested in four strains of Staphylococcus aureus and seven strains of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Submersion aerated cultivation was used for enzyme production; optimum cultivation time is about 100 hours (Figs. 1, 2). To determine the activity of the enzymes produced a screening method was developed applying hemolytic interactions with CAMP factor of Str. agalactiae. Method sensitivity and reproducibility are sufficiently high for the purposes of observation (Tab. III). The produced enzymes did not show any changes in their activity over the whole period of storage under all conditions of storage (32 days/7 degrees C, 48 weeks/-18 degrees C, lyophilizate 48 weeks/20 degrees C). Sphingomyelinasis C is more resistant to heat denaturation, not losing its activity even after being warmed to 85 degrees C for 5 min; sphingomyelinasis D is sensitive to temperatures higher than 50 degrees C (Fig. 3). COREX was selected (sphingomyelinasis D), produced by the strain CNTCC 18/62 of C. pseudotuberculosis. The enzyme was applied either in raw filtrate of the medium (sterilization by repeated membrane filtration) or in prepurified form obtained by cold acetone precipitation, providing the same results. The medium is highly specific and likely enough selective for Str. agalactiae, unlike BHE it does not provide any positive results with UBERIS-factor+strains of Str. uberis (Tab. V). Optimum cultivation time is 18 hours; prolongation of cultivation for more than 24 hours brings about the risk of falsely positive readings (Tab. VI) in the strains of accompanying microflora (Morganella morganii ssp. morganii, delta-hemolytic staphylococci).
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - Comparison of success of antibiotic therapy during lactation and results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bovine mastitis.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on a variety of mastitis pathogens. The infected quarters were subsequently treated during lactation with a commercially available product containing penicillin and novobiocin that was designed for lactating cows. Cows were treated as per the recommendations of the product manufacturer, and cures were determined by the absence of bacteria in both sets of duplicate quarter milk samples that were collected at 28 d posttreatment. Comparisons were made between the susceptibility of the bacteria and the therapeutic success or failure. All isolates tested were considered to be susceptible to the penicillin and novobiocin combination. Bacteriologic cure rates for newly acquired Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection (IMI) (< 2 wk in duration) at 28 d posttreatment were 70%. Cure rates for chronic Staph. aureus IMI (> 4 wk duration) were much lower (35%), reaffirming previous reports of the intractable nature of chronic Staph. aureus IMI. Cure rates for subclinical IMI caused by other organisms were 90% for Streptococcus agalactiae, 91% for Streptococcus uberis, 90% for Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 77% for other Streptococcus spp., and 71% for Staphylococcus spp. other than Staph. aureus. In vitro testing was considered to be a predictor of therapy outcome for IMI caused by Staphylococcus spp., newly acquired Staph. aureus, Strep. uberis, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. agalactiae, but was not considered to be a useful predictor of efficacy for chronic IMI caused by Staph. aureus.
TI  - Cloning of the glutamine synthetase gene from group B streptococci.
AB  - The glnA gene from the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae was cloned from a  genomic library prepared with the lambda phage vector lambdaDASHII. A 4.6-kb DNA fragment of one of the recombinant phages was subcloned in pUC18. This Escherichia coli clone expressed a 52-kDa protein encoded by a 1,341-bp open reading frame. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence shared a significant degree of homology with the sequences of other glutamine synthetases (GS). The highest homology was between our deduced protein and GS of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids with the cloned streptococcal glnA were able to complement E. coli glnA mutants grown on minimal media. Rabbit antisera to streptococcal GS recombinant protein recognized not only the recombinant protein but also a similar-sized band in mutanolysin extracts of all group B streptococcal strains tested, regardless of polysaccharide type or surface protein profile. The amino acid sequence of the deduced protein had similarities to other streptococcal cell-surface-bound proteins. The possible functional role of the immunological features of streptococcal GS is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial complications of primary varicella in children.
AB  - Bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age  (48 females; median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. The purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. Seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. The eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (P = .00025). Skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or shock occurred in 23 (27%). The latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (P = .011) and bacteremia (P = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (P = .001), prolonged hospitalization (P < .0001), intensive care management (P < .0001), and fatal outcome (P = .019). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. Before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (P = .09). These data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.
TI  - Management of staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus and streptococcus are bacteria commonly found on the skin and in the mucous membrane. These bacteria are frequently associated with mild cutaneous infections but may invade to cause deeper infections including necrotizing soft-tissue infections, sepsis with or without metastatic lesions, and immunologic or toxin associated sequelae. Early recognition and timely intervention are the hallmarks of appropriate management. Initial empiric therapy should be directed towards a broad spectrum of pathogens that include staphylococcus and streptococcus.
TI  - Efficacy of teat dips containing a hypochlorous acid germicide against experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Two teat dip formulations containing sodium dichloroisocyanurate, which released  hypochlorous acid (2800 ppm) as the active ingredient, were tested for efficacy against new Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae IMI using an experimental challenge model. Product 1 reduced the number of new Staph. aureus IMI by 73.6% and reduced the number of new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 65.1%. Product 2 reduced the number of new Staph. aureus IMI by 69.0% and reduced the number of new Strep. agalactiae IMI by 63.5%. No adverse effects on teat skin condition were observed over the course of the studies.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) The susceptibilities of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. The MIC at which the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (MIC90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) Seven puerperal women received 200 mg of CPDX-PR orally. The CPDX concentration in the lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. The CPDX concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after CPDX-PR administration. The CPDX concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and gradually declined thereafter. These results suggest that CPDX-PR, with its good transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Bacterial causes of bovine mastitis in Wondogenet, Ethiopia.
AB  - A survey of selected causative organisms of bacterial mastitis in Zebu-Holstein dairy cows was carried out on four herds in Wondogenet. Pathogens were found in 39% of udder quarters and mastitis in 16% of quarters. The main mastitis causing organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (47%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15%) and Streptococcus uberis (31%). It was indicated also that udder quarters with micrococci would be less susceptible to infections by pathogenic organisms.
TI  - [Development of resistance in infectious agents of agricultural animals in Germany (1990-1994)--a review].
AB  - Antibiograms received from veterinary laboratories during the 1990-1994 period were recorded and evaluated with the aid of a computer program. Based on 70 tables giving information about th most important pathogens, the resistance behaviour of E. coli in cattle, swine, chicken, and turkey, that of Pasteurella haemolytica and P. multocida in cattle and swine and that of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in cattle have been in synoptic form. Attention is drawn to the increase in resistance to enrofloxacin shown by E. coli, particularly in turkeys.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon Tn3706 in Streptococcus agalactiae B128.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae B128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group B streptococcal (GBS) strain described so far. This strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated Tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the Tn4001 and Tn5281 transpons detected in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Transposition of Tn3706 occurred onto the GBS plasmid pIP501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb AvaII fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. Molecular analysis of pIP501 derivatives showed that Tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of IS256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and a single inverted copy of IS256 at its 3' extremity. The two tandemly repeated copies of IS256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the same orientation, in the IS256-aac6'-aph2" junction. The hybrid replicons pIP501::Tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between GBS strains. Numerous individual copies of IS256 were detected in B128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible GBS strains studied.
TI  - Efficacy of florfenicol for treatment of clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy of florfenicol treatment for bovine mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus nonagalactiae streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, and others. DESIGN: Double blind study with cases randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. SAMPLE POPULATION: 861 cows/10 commercial dairy farms. PROCEDURE: Experimental (750 mg of florfenicol) or control (200 mg of cloxacillin) treatment was administered by intramammary infusion every 12 hours for 3 treatment to all cases. Treatments were randomly assigned identified only by numerical labels. To retain blinding, the longer withdrawal time was adhered to for all cases. Cases remained in the study only if there was no other treatment. Quarter samples were recultured 14, 21, and 28 days later. If all samples after day 1 were culture negative, the case was defined as cured. If only 1 of the follow-up results was positive, the case was considered cured if the day-28 somatic cell count was < 300,000/ ml. Failure of treatment was defined as 2 or more culture positive follow-up samples. RESULTS: Florfenicol and cloxacillin did not differ significantly in efficacy versus clinical (n = 85) or subclinical (n = 71) bovine mastitis, or for any etiologic agent (X2). Overall cure rates for mastitis were: Str agalactiae, 5 of 8 (63%); Sta aureus, 5 of 54 (9%); Streptococcus sp, 16 of 35 (46%); Staphylococcus sp, 7 of 33 (21%); E coli, 5 of 11 (46%); Klebsiella sp, 3 of 6 (50%); others, 1 of 9 (11%); and all cases, 42 of 156 (27%). CONCLUSIONS: Florfenicol did not offer any advantage over cloxacillin in efficacy against bovine mastitis. Overall cure rates were low. As with most mastitis treatment regimens poor efficacy may be partly attributable to the short duration of treatment.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the eps (Exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - We report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. This report is the first genetic work concerning EPS production in a food microorganism. The EPS secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D- D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-D-GalpNAc-(1-->. The genetic locus The genetic locus was identified by Tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify Eps mutants. Sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of Sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. EPS expression in the non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsA to epsM was capable of directing EPS synthesis and secretion in this host. Homology searches of the predicted proteins in the Swiss-Prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsA, B, C, D, and E and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsB, D, F, and H and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus for epsC, D, and E and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide I (EPSI) synthesis in Rhizobium meliloti for epsC to epsJ and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps K and lipB of Neisseria meningitidis. Genes (epsJ, epsL, and epsM) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - Effects of freezing on the viability of nine pathogens from quarters with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Milk samples from 45 quarters containing mastitis pathogens were collected from lactating cows to determine the viability of those pathogens after freezing. An initial bacteria count was conducted, and samples were divided into 2-ml portions and frozen. Weekly bacteria counts were conducted for 6 wk. Viability after freezing was determined on five isolates of nine bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus xylosus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteria counts were converted to logarithm base 10, and analysis of variance was conducted to determine alterations in viability over the 6-wk period. Freezing of quarter milk samples for 6 wk did not affect viability of any of these pathogens.
TI  - [Treatment of osteomyelitis with oral bactericidal antibiotics-- description of 9 cases].
AB  - The efficacy of oral bactericidal antibiotics in the treatment of osteomyelitis is analyzed retrospectively by a review of 9 cases histories. The first patient was treated in 1982. Clinical and laboratory controls were reviewed up to 1.1.1995. In 6 patients S. aureus was isolated, while in 3 patients the organism could not be cultured but gram + cocci were almost likely. 5 cases of osteomyelitis were acute, 4 were chronic and in one case there was an infection of an artificial knee prothesis. The isolated S. aureus were sensitive to the antibiotics prescribed. 8 patients received a combination of flucloxacillin (2-4 g/day) and rifampicin (600 mg/day); one patient was treated with the combination amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1500/425 mg/day) followed by ofloxacin (400 mg/day) and finally co-trimoxazole (320/1600 mg/day). 3 patients received all antibiotics orally; in 6 patients oral administration followed a short intravenous course of the antibiotic combination. The duration of treatment varied between 6 and 23 weeks. Follow-up extended over 9 months (n = 1), 14 months (n = 3), 4-7 years (n = 3), and 10-12 years (n = 2). In 8 cases the osteomyelitis was cured (89%). In our view, a combination of bactericidal oral antibiotics with good penetration into bone tissue can be prescribed in selected cases of osteomyelitis to shorten or even avoid the standard intravenous therapy of acute or chronic diseases.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization in infants with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus colonizes eczematous lesions in 78-100% of children and adults with atopic dermatitis (AD), whereas it is found on skin of healthy subjects in only 2-25% of cases. On unaffected skin of subjects with AD the bacterium has been isolated in 51-100% of cases. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This paper examines rate and density of S. aureus colonization, using the swab technique and the contact plate method, respectively, on affected and unaffected skin in 72 infants with AD (age 3-24 months) and in a control group, to determine if there are significant differences with respect to what is reported for children and adults with AD. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The main differences is that on unaffected skin of our infants with AD, bacterium colonization rate is significantly lower than on affected skin.
TI  - Effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. We examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (Alveofact, Survanta and Exosurf) approved for treatment of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on Legionella pneumophila serogroup I as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. Addition of Survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined E. coli strains. As opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the exception of Exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of group B streptococci. Though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.
TI  - Clinical and diagnostic features of osteomyelitis occurring in the first three months of life.
AB  - We report a retrospective study of 94 infants, ages < 4 months, who underwent investigation for possible osteomyelitis during a 9-year period. Of the 30 babies with proven osteomyelitis (radiographic changes or positive bone cultures or positive blood cultures plus a compatible clinical picture), 17 were preterm artificially ventilated babies and 4 were full term infants receiving intensive care. An etiologic organism was isolated from 28: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 16; methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 7; Escherichia coli, 3; and group B Streptococcus, 2. MRSA occurred exclusively in the preterm group. Osteomyelitis was multifocal in 40% and associated with septic arthritis in 47%. The long bones were frequently affected (80%) whereas the flat bones were often sites of clinically silent disease. Twenty-five (83.3%) of the 30 babies with proven osteomyelitis had focal clinical signs or evidence of disseminated staphylococcal disease. Only 10 were febrile. Four of 27 babies investigated because of positive blood cultures for S. aureus but no focal signs had osteomyelitis, as did only 1 of 27 babies with suspected sepsis but no focal signs. The sensitivity of 99mTc bone scanning was 84%, specificity 89%, positive predictive value 79% and negative predictive value 92%. The addition of gallium scanning (in 39 of the 94 infants) improved the respective figures to 90, 97, 93 and 95% and was useful in interpreting equivocal bone scans.
TI  - Partial characterization of the cohemolytic factor produced by Streptococcus uberis and comparison with the CAMP-factor.
AB  - Exosubstances (cohemolysins) produced by Streptococcus agalactiae (CAMP-factor) and Streptococcus uberis (Uberis-factor) showing hemolytic synergism with beta-lysin produced by Staphylococcus aureus were compared. Cohemolytic activity was evaluated in the supernatants of bacterial cultures, before and after ammonium sulfate precipitation. Sheep erythrocytes sensitized with beta-lysin were used as substrate. The assays were performed in microtiter plates and results were expressed as cohemolytic units/ml. Maximum cohemolytic activity was detected, respectively, after 8 h and 14 h of growth in Columbia broth in S. uberis and S. agalactiae cultures. Cohemolytic activities of both microorganisms showed similarities when submitted to various physical and chemical treatments. They were significantly decreased by heating at 60 degrees C and 100 degrees C, or in presence of trypsin, and were abolished in the presence of Tween 20. Activities were found to be stable in crude supernatants and concentrated preparations maintained at -20 degrees C for 3 months. Differences were related to levels of activity and kinetics of detection during the growth cycle. The results indicate the proteic nature, at least in part, of the Uberis factor. Analysis by PAGE in the presence or absence of SDS allowed us to correlate Uberis activity with a protein band with apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa, while CAMP activity was associated with a protein band of 27 kDa.
TI  - Efficacy of barrier-type postmilking teat germicides against intramammary infection.
AB  - Two barrier teat dips were evaluated for efficacy in preventing new IMI by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae during experimental exposure trials, and two barrier dips were evaluated during natural exposure trials. Dipping in an experimental product containing nicin as a germicide using experimental exposure demonstrated no difference in rate of new Staph. aureus IMI (10.2%) compared with that of controls (7.1%) or in the rate of new Strep. agalactiae IMI (13.6%) compared with that of controls (11%). Testing of an experimental .55% chlorhexidine gluconate barrier dip using experimental exposure resulted in an increased rate of new Staph. aureus IMI compared with that of controls (4.8 vs. 1.7%, respectively), but no difference in the rate of new Strep. agalactiae IMI in dipped quarters (6.1%) compared with that of controls (3.3%). Dipping with a commercial .3% iodine barrier dip during natural exposure increased the number of new coagulase-negative staphylococcal and total IMI by 56.6 and 30.6%, respectively, compared with a 1% iodophor dip without barrier. Use of an experimental .3% iodine barrier dip during natural exposure demonstrated no difference in total rate of new IMI (18.4%) compared with that of controls (20.3%); however, after germicide concentration was increased to .5% iodine and further tested, the reformulated product reduced new IMI by 43.1%. Under the conditions of these trials, the barrier teat dips tested were no more efficacious than no teat dip or using a nonbarrier product.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin, was active against selected gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-susceptible clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus warneri, against which it had excellent activity. S-1090 was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae among the agents compared. The in vivo efficacy of S-1090 against systemic and urinary and respiratory tract infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria was superior to that expected from the in vitro and in vivo activities of the agents against which it was compared.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 71.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) was also active with the MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis VCM showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The others except ABPC were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae Most of the agents were active against S. agalactiae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Penicillins, cephems, erythromycin (EM), and clindamycin (CLDM) showed the highest activities. The MIC90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml or below. Amikacin (AMK) and minocycline (MINO) showed somewhat low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. Cefozopran (CZOP) and gentamicin (GM) were also active with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems generally were not so active. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM and GM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. CZOP and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Flomoxef (FMOX), CZOP, IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of the bovine myeloperoxidase system against bacteria associated with mastitis.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a lysosomal enzyme found in the primary granules of mammalian neutrophils. Together with MPO, peroxide and halide form a system of defense against bacteria. The present investigation was undertaken to study the bactericidal effects of the bovine-MPO/peroxide/halide system on pathogenic bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. We demonstrated that MPO together with oxidizing agents generated by xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine and chloride form a potent antibacterial system against the common udder pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Escherichia coli in a synthetic medium. However, when milk was added to the reaction mixture, the bactericidal properties of this enzyme system were completely inhibited. Loss of bactericidal activity in the milk-containing cultures was unable to be restored by increasing the concentration of MPO. Nor did an increase in concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, or the replacement of the above-mentioned peroxidase generating system with a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide, significantly elevated the bactericidal activity that was inhibited by milk. The addition of bovine serum albumin to the synthetic medium reduced the bactericidal activity of the MPO/peroxide/chloride system in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, milk proteins probably form adducts with strong bactericidal agents that are generated by the MPO system and thereby reduce the bactericidal potential of this system.
TI  - A fluorometric beta-glucuronidase assay for analysis of bacterial growth in milk.
AB  - The growth of common mastitis-causing bacteria in milk was followed by a fluorometric technique based on the release of fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide by the beta-glucuronidase of bacterial or milk origin. Three of four Escherichia coli strains, all four strains of Streptococcus uberis (4/4) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4/4) produced beta-glucuronidase. Four Staphylococcus aureus strains (4/4) and one E. coli strain, though unable to produce the enzyme, activated the milk beta-glucuronidase most probably by lowering the pH of bacterial cultures in milk for optimum activity of the indigenous enzyme. The beta-glucuronidase of milk, Str. uberis and Str. agalactiae origin had similar optimum pH ranges (5.3-6.6) while E. coli beta-glucuronidase was more active at neutral or slightly alkaline pH (6.8-7.7). The increase of beta-glucuronidase activity in milk cultures of E. coli, Str. uberis, Str. agalactiae and S. aureus seemed to parallel the increase of colony forming units and were dependent on the inoculum size. The time to reach a predetermined enzyme threshold in E. coli-milk cultures showed excellent linear relationship with the inoculum size.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990.

TI  - [The dairying veterinary approach to a high bulk milk cell count caused by Streptococcus agalactiae].
AB  - The herd health approach for dairy herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count, in which Streptococcus agalactiae plays a major role, was evaluated. After introduction of the standard mastitis prevention programme, all quarters of infected cows were treated during lactation. In three of the four herds investigated, the bulk milk somatic cell count dropped below the limit of 400,000 cells/ml for a long period of time. The herd in which there were many infections with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was an exception. The management, somatic cell count, and prevalence of subclinical mastitis in the different herds is discussed. It is concluded that for infection with Streptococcus agalactiae at the herd level, treatment during lactation can be an effective method to lower the bulk milk somatic cell count. In essence, however, the approach to the problem lies in the standard mastitis prevention programme.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [Reliability of bacteriological studies of composite samples in the diagnosis of  subclinical udder infections in cattle].
AB  - This study evaluated the reliability of making bacteriological cultures of composite milk samples for the diagnosis of subclinical udder infections in dairy herds. Quarter samples as well as composite samples were collected from 482 cows with suspected subclinical mastitis from 69 Dutch dairy farms. The samples were used to measured somatic cell counts and to prepare bacteriological cultures. The sensitivity and specificity of the bacteriological cultures of the composite samples were compared with those of the quarter samples. The sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae was 57.9%, 65.2%, 86.6%, and 60.3%, respectively. The specificity was higher than 98% for all four bacteria. Although information is lost when composite samples are used, composite samples are useful, especially for large dairy herds. The advantage and disadvantages of the use of composite samples are discussed.
TI  - [Udder disinfection and mastitis in cattle: a literature review].
AB  - Postmilking teat disinfection is accepted as an important part of standard preventive measures against mastitis in dairy cattle. The efficacy of postmilking teat disinfection against infections with contagious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae is beyond doubt. However, the efficacy of teat disinfection against infections with environmental pathogens such as Escherichia coli is disputed, and a negative effect has even been described in some situations. This article reviews the practice of teat disinfection in dairy cattle. Premilking and postmilking teat disinfection are discussed, as is the efficacy, different ways of teat disinfection, and different disinfectants. It is concluded that post-milking teat disinfection is an effective management measure in most herds. Selection of teat disinfectants should be based on proven efficacy, which is required for registration of the preparation as a veterinary medical product in the Netherlands.
TI  - The visual appearance and somatic cell count of mammary secretions collected from primigravid heifers during gestation and early postpartum.
AB  - Mammary secretions, obtained before and after calving, were examined for visual appearance, SCC, and bacteriology as part of a larger study determining the prevalence of IMI in 1588 primigravid heifers. Appearance of secretions was categorized into five groups: thin and watery, honey-like, serumy, milky, or thickened colostrum. Precalving secretions were further characterized as low viscosity (thin and watery, serumy, or milky) or high viscosity (honey-like and thickened colostrum). Postcalving secretions were further characterized as normal (milky, thickened colostrum) or abnormal (thin and watery, serumy, or honey-like). Infected precalving quarters (81%) had low viscosity secretions. Quarters that were uninfected precalving (75%) had high viscosity secretions. Greater than 90% of all postcalving milk samples appeared to be normal, regardless of geographic location, season, or bacterial infection status. Only 77% of the samples from quarters infected with contagious and noncontagious mastitis pathogens had normal appearance. Precalving SCC from bacteriologically negative quarters were lower than SCC from infected quarters. Similarly, postcalving SCC were lower from the bacteriologically negative quarters than from the infected quarters. Infected quarters had higher mean SCC than the uninfected quarters during both pre- and postcalving periods.

AB  - Due to lack of evidence of infection in patients for ovarian punction for ovular  capture, the hypothesis of possible antibacterial action that could exist in follicular fluid, was evaluated. One hundred and ten samples of such fluid, were taken for antibacterial analysis, 37 of which, were studied, as they were the clearest ones and not contaminated. Such samples were obtained from hyperstimulated patients, ready for ovular capture through vagina by ultrasonographic guide. A bacterial inoculum, was prepared, in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of follicular fluid against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. agalactiae, L. monocytogenes and C. albicans. Counting of bacterial colonies, at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Results summary shows bacteriostatic activity in all studied colonies, and E. coli and S. agalactiae seem to be the most sensitive, followed by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes; and still present in C. albicans. It is concluded that follicular fluid has an antibacterial action, probably selective; and that keeping this research line will confirm this finding, and possibly will determine the concerned factors.
TI  - Development of a direct viable count procedure for some gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The direct viable count (DVC) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. It should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only Gram-negative species, mainly because the DVC procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of Gram-positive bacteria since the DVC procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. The authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable Gram-positive bacteria. To facilitate a differential DVC for Gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. These antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they are DNA gyrase inhibitors. The concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000 micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. Pure cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the University of Wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the Laramie wastewater treatment plant. An antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. The antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged cells in the DVC procedure varied between organisms.
TI  - [Balanitis and infectious agents. A prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the Centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the St. Louis Hospital in Paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. All underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. Sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. Two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. RESULTS: Candida albicans (CA) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. A pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus milleri, group HB5) was found without CA in 28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group D streptococci) was found without CA in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. DISCUSSION: This series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with and without balanitis (p < 0.9). The role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? The significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. The clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.
TI  - Relations between udder infection and somatic cells in camel (camelus dromedarius) milk.
AB  - Quarter milk samples (n = 391) from 101 camels were examined to study the occurrence and causes of mastitis in traditionally managed camels in eastern Sudan and to evaluate the value of the California Mastitis Test (CMT), somatic cell count (SCC) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the detection of subclinical mastitis in the camel. One hundred and seventy (43.5%) of the quarter milk samples yielded pathogenic bacteria. Streptococcus agalactiae, other Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Escherichia coli were isolated from milk. Thirty-two (8.2%) quarter milk samples yielded mixed cultures, and 189 (48.3%) yielded no growth. Mean values for CMT, SCC and ATP were higher for quarters infected with major pathogens. However, a significant number of quarter milk samples had elevated values in these tests but were from quarters from which no bacteria were isolated. The ability of the tests to predict a positive bacteriology increased slightly when 2 or 3 tests were combined.

TI  - A study of mastitis bacteria and herd management practices to identify their relationship to high somatic cell counts in bulk tank milk.
AB  - Thirty dairy herds, selected to cover a wide range of bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC) values, were used to study the relationship between the levels of the principal species of mastitis-causing bacteria, herd management practices and the BTSCC. A good correlation was found between the number of mastitis streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis) found in bulk tank milk and the BTSCC. Staphylococcus aureus was less significantly correlated to BTSCC, but was of increasing importance in borderline BTSCC herds, where lower excretion levels into milk were unlikely to trigger hygiene penalties and so alert producers to the presence of a significant mastitis problem. High BTSCC herds had significantly lower yields and were less likely to use a post-milking teat dip or to have a regular programme of milking machine maintenance or automatic cluster removal. These herds also tended to buy in replacements rather than breed their own. Overall the management of high BTSCC herds showed less commitment to implementing mastitis control procedures than herds with a consistently low BTSCC.
TI  - [Bacterial sacroileitis. Clinical findinds and clinical course in 9 cases].
AB  - Since septic sacroileitis is one of the less frequent localizations among joint infections, we decided to review 9 cases in a retrospective study of 5 females and 4 males, aged between 22 and 60 years old. None had a clinically predisposing condition. The initiating factor was gynecologic-obstetric in 4 women, the irruption of the skin barrier in 3 cases and finally in one case the infection reached the joint through the psoas muscle. Fever and lumbar pain were present in all cases and allowed diagnostic orientation. Radiologic and centellographic alterations were useful for clinical confirmation. An articular biopsypunction was performed in 4 cases, while in the other 5 cases the clinical and radiologic features and the bacteriologic positivity in the blood cultures were enough criteria for diagnosis. The bacteriologic findings were Staphylococcus aureus (4 cases), Streptococcus group A beta hemolitico (1 case), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (1 case), Streptococcus agalactiae (1 case), Proteus mirabilis (2 cases). Eight out of 9 patients were treated with a B-lactamic and aminoglycoside association. One patient received her treatment per os, with quinolones. Six patients recovered, 2 died and one needed to be sent to another hospital.
TI  - Efficacy of two barrier teat dips containing chlorous acid germicides against experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Two postmilking teat dips were tested for efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus agalactiae using experimental challenge procedures recommended by the National Mastitis Council. Both dips contained chlorous acid as the primary germicidal agent and lactic acid or mandelic acid as the chlorous acid activator. The dip activated with mandelic acid significantly reduced new IMI by Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae. The IMI rate was reduced 68.7% for Staph. aureus and 56.4% for Strep. agalactiae. The dip activated with lactic acid significantly reduced new Staph. aureus IMI by 69.3% but did not significantly reduce new Strep. agalactiae IMI (35.2% reduction) through the full 11-wk study period. Teat skin condition did not change from pretrial status after using either teat dip during the study.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Effect of naturally occurring coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections on experimental challenge with major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The influence of pre-existing Staphylococcus sp. IMI on development of new IMI after experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was studied. The IMI data were analyzed from five trials in which quarters were challenged with major pathogens incident to studies of teat dip efficacy. Prior to each trial, quarter IMI status was determined, and new IMI were enumerated during challenge. Percentage of new Staph. aureus IMI in uninfected quarters was 3-fold that of quarters already infected with Staphylococcus sp. Of quarters that were initially uninfected, 13.23% acquired new Staph. aureus IMI, and 4.49% of quarters infected with Staphylococcus sp. became infected. Conversely, the percentage of new Strep. agalactiae IMI in quarters infected with Staphylococcus sp. was 1.5-fold that of uninfected quarters (8.38 vs. 5.52%). The percentage of clinical Staph. aureus IMI in uninfected quarters was higher than for quarters infected with Staphylococcus sp., but percentages of clinical Strep. agalactiae IMI were similar among IMI statuses. Geometric mean SCC prior to challenge were 87 x 10(3) for uninfected quarters and 260 x 10(3)/ml for quarters infected with Staphylococcus sp. Quarters infected with Staphylococcus sp. were less susceptible to Staph. aureus IMI, but more susceptible to Strep. agalactiae IMI.
TI  - Group B streptococcus-induced nitric oxide production in murine macrophages is CR3 (CD11b/CD18) dependent.
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by murine macrophages in response to cytokines and/or gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. NO induction by gram-positive bacteria such as group B streptococci (GBS), the major etiologic agents of neonatal pneumonia and meningitis, has received little study. GBS as well as two other gram-positive bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were found to stimulate NO production in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages and in the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 in the presence of gamma interferon. Serotype Ia and III GBS were both stimulatory, as were asialo- and type antigen-deficient mutant strains of type III GBS. NO production was dose dependent, inhibitable by L-arginine analogs, and unaffected by polymyxin B. Since phagocytosis by murine and human phagocytes of GBS is dependent on complement receptor type 3 (CR3), the role of CR3 in the NO response to GBS was tested in the CR3-deficient myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3. GBS did not induce NO, whereas S. aureus or lipopolysaccharide did induce NO in WEHI-3 cells. S. epidermidis, whose nonopsonic phagocytosis is also CR3 dependent, failed to induce NO in WEHI-3 cells. Monoclonal anti-CR3 (anti-CD11b or anti-CD18) in the presence of interferon also induced NO production in thioglycolate-elicited macrophages and in J774A.1 cells but not in WEHI-3 cells. This evidence suggests that ligated CR3 and gamma interferon act synergistically to induce NO production and that CR3 mediates the GBS-induced signal for NO production in interferon-treated macrophages.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Winter evaluation of a postmilking powdered teat dip.
AB  - A powdered teat dip designed for winter usage was evaluated for bacteriological efficacy and teat conditioning qualities. A positive control, natural exposure field trial was conducted for 3 mo on 509 lactating cows. Two sets of cows, primiparous and multiparous, were used. The trial compared efficacy of a powdered teat dip with a teat dip of 1% iodine plus 10% glycerin. Bacteriological efficacy among primiparous cows was equivalent for all major mastitis pathogens, environmental pathogens, and streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae. Efficacy was not equivalent against coagulase-negative staphylococci and all mastitis pathogens. Results suggested that the positive control product was more efficacious. Among multiparous cows, efficacy was equivalent against environmental mastitis pathogens and bacteriologically negative, clinical mastitis. The products were not equivalent against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or all major mastitis pathogens, once again suggesting that the positive control product was more efficacious. Data indicated that germicidal activity of the powdered dip was not sufficient to reduce the incidence of new IMI caused by contagious or minor pathogens normally associated with teat skin. Application of a powdered postmilking teat dip during 3 winter mo in Idaho resulted in improved teat end condition among primiparous and multiparous dairy cows. Teat skin condition improved among primiparous but not among multiparous cows.
TI  - The type I macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad binding specificity for polyanionic ligands and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and various host defense functions. Using a radiolabeled, secreted form of the type I bovine macrophage scavenger receptor in an in vitro binding assay, we have found that this receptor binds to intact Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, and Listeria monocytogenes. Competition binding studies using purified lipoteichoic acid, an anionic polymer expressed on the surface of most Gram-positive bacteria, show that lipoteichoic acids are scavenger receptor ligands and probably mediate binding of the receptor to Gram-positive bacteria. Lipoteichoic acids, for which no host cell receptors have previously been identified, are implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to Gram-positive bacteria. Scavenger receptors may participate in host defense by clearing lipoteichoic acid and/or intact bacteria from tissues and the circulation during Gram-positive sepsis. Since scavenger receptors have been previously shown to bind to and facilitate bloodstream clearance of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), these receptors may provide a general mechanism for macrophage recognition and internalization of pathogens and their cell surface components.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - [Therapy of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in lactating dairy cows using intra-mammary Sulphamycin (Polfa, PR)].
AB  - Sulphamycin (Polfa, Poland) is an intramammary preparation for the treatment of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in dairy cows. Its effects were observed in 141 dairy cows treated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The animals were selected after clinical examination of the mammary gland and bacteriological examination of udder secreta. In 37 subclinically diseased cows the efficiency of treatment depended on the infectious agent and amounted to 85.2, 77.8, 73.3 and 60.0%, Streptococcus agalactiae beta-haemolytical Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium pyogenes being the respective pathogens. In 61 cows with acute mastitis the efficiency of the preparation reached 71.2, 78.3, 61.7 and 80.9% in the cases induced by S. agalactiae, beta-haemolytical Streptococci, S. aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Forty-three cows were treated for acute mastitis and concomitant alteration of the general health state; in these cases, S. agalactiae, S. aureus and E. coli were identified as the infectious agents and the respective therapeutic efficiency presented 62.5, 69.8 and 76.2%. S. agalactiae and beta-haemolytical Streptococci responded most sensitively to erythromycin whereas S. aureus and E. coli proved to be septrin- and streptomycin-sensitive, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Association af changes in the bacterial ecology of bovine mastitis with changes in the use of milking machines and antibacterial drugs.
AB  - The results of mastitis bacteriology made by the National Veterinary and Food Research Institute in Finland during the past 50 years (1.15 million samples) are viewed in relation to simultaneous changes in dairy cow management. Although intensive preventive measures have been applied for decades, the prevalence of bovine mastitis has not decreased. Instead, pathogenic bacteria are becoming progressively less susceptible to the available therapy. In part this must be due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, but it seems that the bacterial spectrum has also changed. The incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci) has decreased, while in contrast, the incidence of staphylococci, initially Staphylococcus aureus and later coagulase-negative staphylococci, has increased. Results suggest that external pressure, like changes in animal husbandry, including antimicrobial treatments and introduction of modern milking machines, act as selective forces on the bacterial species which cause bovine mastitis.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome toxin-secreting Staphylococcus aureus in Kawasaki syndrome.
AB  - Kawasaki syndrome (KS), the main cause of acquired heart disease in children, is  associated with the selective expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in peripheral blood. Our study suggests that KS may be caused by a superantigen--a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. Bacteria were cultured without knowledge of their origin, from the throat, rectum, axilla, and groin of 16 patients with untreated acute KS and 15 controls. Bacteria producing toxins were isolated from 13 of 16 KS patients but from only 1 of 15 controls (p < 0.0001). Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) secreting Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 11 of the 13 toxin-positive cultures, and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin (SPE) B and C were found in the other 2. These toxins are known to stimulate V beta 2+ T cells. All TSST-producing KS isolates were tryptophan auxotrophs indicating they were clonally related. S aureus isolates from acute KS patients were unusual because they produced less lipase, haemolysin, and protease compared to other isolates (p < 0.01). S aureus colonies from KS patients were white, and could be easily mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas colonies of non-KS isolates were gold. These observations suggest that the expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in most patients with KS may be caused by a new clone of TSST-producing S aureus, and, in a minority of patients, SPEB-producing or SPEC-producing streptococci.
TI  - Immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis.
AB  - Immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis are active areas of investigation. The past decade has seen development of effective and economical R-mutant vaccines for gram-negative mastitis. These vaccines doubtless will prove beneficial on well managed dairies that have eradicated contagious mastitis pathogens. Development of vaccines for other mastitis pathogens has been noticeably slower. A commercially available Staphylococcus aureus vaccine appears to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical episodes, but probably has minimal impact on the incidence or prevalence of infection. This product has not been extensively studied. The recent recognition of virulence factors produced in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus may provide a breakthrough in the development and production of Staphylococcus aureus vaccines. Bacterins employing this principle presently are not commercially available, however. In the case of all contagious mastitis pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma spp.), traditional control and eradication efforts (teat dip, dry cow therapy, culling programs) likely will prove preferable to long-term immunization. Ongoing research may provide more efficacious vaccines for these mastitis syndromes. Immunostimulants are an active area of research. Although leukopoietic factors appear promising as immunostimulants, no compound has clearly demonstrated efficacy in either the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Contagious mastitis.
AB  - Contagious mastitis is defined. The major mastitis pathogens are Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium bovis, Mycoplasma sp, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. These pathogens are discussed relative to prevalence, virulence factors, pathology, and control. These control measures include milking time hygiene, segregation, culling, vaccination, and treatment.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Culture of bulk tank milk as a mastitis screening test: A brief review.
AB  - The culture of a sample of bulk tank milk may be a useful technique by which to screen herds for major mastitis pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, if identified on a culture of a sample of bulk milk, reliably indicate infection of the udder. Environmental bacteria, such as the other streptococci and coliforms, are unlikely to be indicative of the proportion of cows infected with these organisms.Samples of bulk milk are readily obtainable and can be rapidly and inexpensively cultured to screen large numbers of herds for mastitis-causing bacteria, yet the performance of the test has only recently been formally assessed for its ability to correctly classify herds according to infection status.A single culture of bulk tank milk has been found to be a test with low sensitivity and high specificity for determining the presence of S. agalactiae or S. aureus in the herd. This means that many infected herds will be called negative, but few uninfected herds will be classified as positive.The literature assessing the performance of bulk tank milk culture in comparison with other mastitis screening tests, the use of bulk milk culture for prevalence surveys, and factors affecting these results is discussed.
TI  - Infections of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: approach to management.
AB  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are being used with increasing frequency  for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Nevertheless, no guidelines exist for the management of infections of these devices. We report our experience with infections of these devices and review the English-language literature. In all cases, patients presented with local signs of generator infection; systemic signs of infection and bacteremia were often absent. Most infections are due to staphylococcus. Risk factors for the development of infection include placement of the device via median sternotomy during another cardiac surgical procedure, reoperation, and intercurrent infection at another site. Infections are most reliably treated with full explantation of the device and antibiotics. In rare cases, patients may respond to a combination of intravenous antibiotics and removal and replacement of only the generator.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Efficacy evaluations on five chlorhexidine teat dip formulations.
AB  - Three developmental postmilking teat dip formulations containing chlorhexidine digluconate were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in sequential experimental exposure trials. Two additional commercial chlorhexidine digluconate teat dip products were evaluated in natural exposure trials. Under conditions of experimental challenge, the developmental formulations were efficacious against Staph. aureus but did not significantly reduce incidence of new IMI by Strep. agalactiae. None of the three formulations of a conventional germicide used as teat sanitizers effectively reduced incidence of new Strep. agalactiae IMI under experimental challenge conditions. In the natural exposure trials with negative controls, a .35% chlorhexidine teat sanitizer had efficacy of 88.7% against Staph. aureus and 51.4% against Strep. agalactiae. The .5% chlorhexidine product reduced Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae IMI by 86 and 56%, respectively.
TI  - [Clinical studies on flomoxef in neonates].
AB  - Clinical studies on flomoxef (FMOX) were performed in neonates and the results obtained are summarized as follows. Treatment with FMOX was made in 4 cases of neonatal bacterial infections; 2 cases of sepsis (suspected) and 1 case each of infection of umbilicus and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Results obtained were excellent in 1 case, good in 3 cases. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in management  of experimental infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - The in vivo effects of penicillin and cefprozil therapy on the interaction between organisms commonly recovered from inflamed tonsils were studied by using a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. These organisms were group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), Streptococcus salivarius (which is capable of interfering with GABHS), and Staphylococcus aureus. In mice infected with GABHS and S. salivarius alone or in combination, penicillin eliminated both organisms and cefprozil eliminated GABHS and S. aureus but not S. salivarius. Penicillin did not, however, reduce the number of GABHS or S. salivarius in the presence of S. aureus. The present study demonstrated the ability of beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus to protect GABHS from penicillin. However, no such protection was present following the administration of cefprozil. Furthermore, the preservation of S. salivarius that interferes with GABHS growth may provide protection from reinfection with GABHS. This study supports and provides an explanation for the increased efficacies of cephalosporins administered orally over that of penicillin when treating patients with acute GABHS pharyngitis or tonsillitis.
TI  - Group B streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome: report of a case and purification of an associated pyrogenic toxin.
AB  - A patient with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is described. The patient had all of the defining criteria for toxic shock syndrome (TSS), including fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, desquamation, and involvement of multiple organs. Neither Staphylococcus aureus nor group A streptococci were recovered, but vaginal and urine cultures yielded group B streptococci. The group B streptococcal isolate gave negative results in antibody tests for the production of TSS toxin 1, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and streptococcal scarlet fever toxins. However, the strain produced a novel pyrogenic toxin. This toxin, purified from culture fluids by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, had a molecular weight of 12,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.0. The purified toxin was pyrogenic in rabbits, enhanced the susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock, and caused the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes; these properties define pyrogenic toxins. When given to three rabbits via a subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, the toxin caused TSS-like symptoms ending in death. Three additional group B streptococcal strains from patients with TSLS were tested and were found to produce a toxin with similar properties.
TI  - Evaluation of 57 teat sanitizers using excised cow teats.
AB  - Fifty-seven teat dip formulations were tested for germicidal activity with an excised teat assay. Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 27956), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29740), and Escherichia coli+ (a wild strain isolated from an Ohio cow 2956RR during the dry period) were used. Log reductions ranged from 5.6480 to 1.8330 for Strep. agalactiae compared with undipped controls. Staphylococcus aureus were reduced from 4.8972 to 1.0102. Escherichia coli were reduced from 5.8677 to 1.1450. The percentages of the products tested that had log reductions < 3 against Strep. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and E. coli were 24, 30, and 61. Four teat dip formulations contained 4% sodium hypochlorite; all were effective against Strep. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and E. coli. The three formulations containing glutaraldehyde were effective against the three mastitis pathogens. Formulations containing 1 and .5% iodine were not consistently effective against Strep. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, or E. coli. Teat sanitizers containing .5% chlorhexidine also showed inconsistency. Variations in formulation for products containing iodine or chlorhexidine affected germicidal activity.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Detection of bacterial antigens in milk samples from clinical cases of bovine mastitis in which culture is negative.
AB  - ELISAs to detect antigens against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis were developed and used on whey samples from quarter milk samples from cases of clinical mastitis in which no bacterial pathogen had been isolated by standard culture techniques. Antigens against one or other of the bacteria listed above were detected in 68 per cent of 84 samples. Fifty-one per cent of the 84 samples contained antigens to E coli. Antigens against one or other of these bacteria were also detected in 51 per cent of 53 quarter milk samples which were negative on culture but had somatic cell counts of more than 500,000 cells/ml. It is suggested that ELISAs for the detection of antigens in quarter milk samples could be a useful adjunct to culture, to determine the infection status of a quarter.
TI  - Prevalence of contagious pathogens of bovine mastitis and use of mastitis control practices.
AB  - A cross-sectional study of 1,032 dairy herds in Ohio was conducted to determine the prevalence of the major contagious pathogens of mastitis (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and the use of common mastitis control measures. Herd owners were surveyed by mail concerning their use of mastitis control measures. The survey focused on treatment of nonlactating cows, postmilking teat dipping, culling practices, milking machine maintenance, treatment for clinical mastitis, and premilking hygiene practices. Nearly 90% of questionnaires were returned. The prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus was determined by use of bulk-tank milk samples. Most herds (n = 802) met the criteria for classification into 1 of 4 groups: (1) Free of contagious pathogens, as determined by inability to isolate coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS) and esculin-negative CAMP positive streptococci (ENCPS) from 3 bulk-tank milk samples, (2) CPS, but not ENCPS, isolated from at least 1 sample, (3) ENCPS, but not CPS, isolated from at least 1 sample, (4) both ENCPS and CPS isolated from at least 1 sample. The number of herds in which both ENCPS and CPS were isolated was low; therefore, these herds were grouped with herds in which ENCPS alone was isolated for the evaluation of mastitis control practices related to herd pathogen status. Herd somatic cell count (SCC) was determined using Dairy Herd Improvement Association data by calculating the geometric mean SCC from individual cow test day SCC. Twelve months of SCC data from 741 herds were included in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of miocamycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin on Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The 16-membered macrolide miocamycin (MOM) has been compared with the 14-membered compounds erythromycin and roxithromycin in terms of causing post-antibiotic effects (PAE). Five strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 S. agalactiae and 3 enterococci, of differing phenotypes of resistance to erythromycin, were tested. PAE were measured follwonig exposure of cocci to 1 x, 3 x and 10 x MICs of each antibiotic. Against the staphylococci and group A streptococci the three macrolides gave similar results, PAE of 1- h at 1 x MIC, 2-4 h at 3 x MIC and > 4 h at 10 x MIC being observed. For group B streptococci and the only erythromycin-sensitive enterococcus tested, PAE due to MOM were at least double those due to erythromycin or roxithromycin, at each concentration tested. MOM produced significant PAE for the strains that were inducibly resistant to erythromycin and roxithromycin.
TI  - Group B streptococci invade endothelial cells: type III capsular polysaccharide attenuates invasion.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. The pathogenesis of GBS disease is not completely defined. GBS-induced endothelial cell injury is suggested by histological findings at autopsy and in animal studies. We hypothesized that (i) type III GBS (COH-1) invade and injure human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells and (ii) isogenic mutations in GBS capsule synthesis would influence HUVE invasion. Confluent HUVE monolayers were infected for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. Media with penicillin plus gentamicin were added and incubated for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. Cells were washed and lysed, and the number of live intracellular bacteria was determined by plate counting. COH-1 invaded HUVE cells in a time-dependent manner at levels 1,000-fold higher than those of the noninvasive Escherichia coli strain but significantly lower than those of Staphylococcus aureus. There was no evidence for net intracellular replication of GBS within HUVE cells. COH-1 infection of HUVE cells caused the release of lactate dehydrogenase activity. GBS invasion was inhibited by cytochalasin D in a dose-dependent manner; GBS-induced lactate dehydrogenase release was attenuated by cytochalasin D. The isogenic strains COH 1-11, devoid of capsular sialic acid, and COH 1-13, devoid of all type III capsule, invaded HUVE cells three- to fivefold more than the parent COH-1 strain. The type III capsular polysaccharide and particularly the capsular sialic acid attenuate GBS invasion of HUVE cells. Electron micrographs of lung tissue from a GBS-infected newborn Macaca nemestrina also showed GBS within capillary endothelial cells. We conclude that endothelial cell invasion and injury are potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of GBS disease.
TI  - Cefprozil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. It is particularly active against the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. Cefprozil is also moderately active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. In comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. Cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. In children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. Thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. While cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  - [The antibacterial activity of the amniotic fluid during the last week of pregnancy].
AB  - Amnion fluid samples were obtained from 100 pregnant women in the last week of pregnancy just before in labor. In detecting of antibacterial effectiveness, S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. agalactiae ATCC 13813 strains were used. Antibacterial effectiveness of amnion fluid to these bacteria are found respectively as; 74%, 63% and 73.9%.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Clinical and experimental study of xiao er ke cuan ling oral liquid in the treatment of infantile bronchopneumonia].
AB  - Xiao Er Ke Chuan Ling Oral Liquid (KCL) is a Chinese herbal preparation consisted of 10 herbs such as Prunus armeniacae, Scutelaria baicalensis, Lonicera japonica etc. 30 children suffering from bronchopneumonia and/or acute bronchitis were treated with KCL (treated group) and another 30 cases were treated with penicillin and aminophylline (control group). RESULTS: cure rate and effective rate in treated group was 26.6%, and 93.3% respectively. While in control group was 30% and 96.6% respectively. No significant differences were seen between them(P > 0.05). The pharmacodynamic experiment showed KCL had potent pharmacological action. The experiment on tracheal fragment of Guinea pig in vitro showed it caused moderately strong smooth muscle relaxation, through inhibition the effect of histamine and acetylcholine. Asthma induction experiment of Guinea pig in vivo showed KCL could significantly prolong the latent period of asthma and alleviate asthmatic symptom. Ammonium water cough induction experiment in mice showed it may apparently prolong cough latent period and reduce times of cough relapse and alleviate cough symptom. KCL had potent antipyretic effect on fever model induced by triple vaccine in rabbits. Bacteriostatic and antiviral experiment in vitro showed the drug had quite strong inhibitory effects for Streptococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Flexners Dysentery bacillus, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it could potently inhibit the respiratory syncytial virus. KCL is an effective drug in treating bronchopneumonia and acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol resistance determinant of the streptococcal plasmid pIP501.
AB  - We have sequenced the chloramphenicol resistance determinant (cat) of plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae to investigate its relationship with other cognate cat determinants. Sequence analysis revealed that it exhibits a high degree of similarity with the cat genes of plasmids pC221 and pUB112 from Staphylococcus aureus and pSCS1 from Staphylococcus intermedius. These genes, however, display several differences in their regulatory and coding regions. These results demonstrate that the cat determinant of plasmid pIP501 belongs to the pC221 subgroup of CAT variants.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Production of an electrolyte beverage from milk permeate.
AB  - The objective of this study was to prepare shelf-stable electrolyte beverages from milk permeate. The average composition of permeate was 4.59% total solids and .40% ash. Lactose was hydrolyzed (approximately 80%) with a commercial fungal lactase enzyme. Additional sweetness was provided by sucrose. The pH was reduced to 3.5 to 3.8 by the addition of citric acid. Shelf-stable products were made using four processes: 1) UHT followed by aseptic filling, 2) heating of filled bottles to 85 degrees C for 30 min, 3) addition of .05% benzoate, and 4) nanopore filtration. The mineral composition of the finished product, expressed in parts per million, was calcium, 150; phosphorus, 157; magnesium, 43; potassium, 1166; sodium, 286; iron, 17; copper, 8; and zinc, 3.4. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella dublin, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae grew well when they were inoculated into unacidified, hydrolyzed permeate. None of these organisms were isolated from properly processed products. A shelf-stable electrolyte beverage high in minerals was made from whole milk permeate. This beverage could be used to replace electrolytes lost from the human body. The production of a permeate beverage would help alleviate disposal problems of permeate.
TI  - [A report of two cases of cervical necrotizing soft-tissue infection].
AB  - Two recent cases of cervical necrotizing soft-tissue infection are herein presented. Case 1. A 52-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes was hospitalized because of an erythematous swelling of the left side of his neck and high grade fever. Fetid yellowish pus exuded from the left parotid area. The swelling extended from the left temporal area to the left supraclavicular fossa, with necrosis of the parotid gland, sternocleidomastoid, masseter and a portion of the strap muscles. Wound cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus. No anaerobic bacteria were detected. Treatment consisted of intravenous administration of antibiotics, control of diabetes with insulin, and debridement of the necrotic tissue, which left an epidermal defect in the initially swollen area. Transfer of a forearm free flap was done after the growth of healthy granulation tissue over the affected area. Case 2. A 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was transferred to our hospital after tracheotomy performed in another hospital because of dyspnea due to severe crepitant swelling of her cheeks and submandibular areas bilaterally, and her left temporal area. A copious amount of fetid pus exuded from the incisions made in the left temporal area, left cheek, and right submandibular area. There were bilateral diffuse rales. Culturing the pus revealed alpha-hemolytic streptococci, while MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected from cultures of sputum. No anaerobic bacteria were found. After intravenous administration of antibiotics, infected wounds and pneumonia were ameliorated, and necrotic subcutaneous tissue and fascia were debrided. The patient was discharged with a residual depression in her left cheek and a scar on her left temporal area.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Evaluation of postmilking teat germicides containing Lauricidin, saturated fatty  acids, and lactic acid.
AB  - The efficacies of postmilking teat germicides containing Lauricidin (glyceryl monolaurate), saturated fatty acids, lactic acid, and lauric acid were determined against new IMI caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in three controlled infection trials. In trial 1, a germicide was evaluated containing 1% Lauricidin, 5% caprylic and capric acids, 6% lactic acid, and .85% lauric acid. New IMI with Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were reduced 81.3 and 49.6%, respectively. Trial 2 germicide involved an artificially aged sample of the formulation evaluated in trial 1. The germicide was aged at 40 degrees C for 5 mo, which was approximately equal to 2 yr at room temperature (24 degrees C). Reductions in new IMI were 81.2 and 27.5% for Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae, respectively. In trial 3, a teat germicide aged at ambient temperature for 33 mo, which was originally formulated to contain 1% Lauricidin, 5% caprylic and capric acids, and 6% lactic acid, was evaluated. Reductions in new IMI were 75.5 and 40.4% for Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae, respectively. The formulation evaluated in trial 1 was superior to other formulations in reducing new IMI by the two test organisms.
TI  - In vitro germicidal activity of teat dips against Nocardia asteroides and other udder pathogens.
AB  - Nine commercial teat dip formulations containing 1.94% linear dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, or 1% available iodine from nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanol-iodine complex, or .5% chlorhexidine acetate were tested for contamination with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and their in vitro germicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Nocardia asteroides. All products were free of bacteria when neutralized samples were tested on blood agar or liquid thioglycollate media. To test for in vitro efficacy, each teat dip preparation was mixed with a suspension of one of the pathogenic test organisms containing 10(8) bacteria/ml (final concentration) for .5 to 15 min. Viable bacteria were evaluated by direct plating of neutralized aliquots and by filtration techniques. All products were effective against E. coli, Staph. aureus, and Strep. agalactiae. With N. asteroides, the direct plating method gave equivocal results. The filtration experiments indicated that all teat dips containing dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanol-iodine complex were effective against all four pathogens. Three of the teat dips containing chlorhexidine acetate were ineffective against N. asteroides. The fourth teat dip, containing chlorhexidine acetate and an emollient, was partially effective.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  - The activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. Decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. Decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, group C and G streptococci, with an MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. It was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml). The activity of decaplanin against enterococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. Decaplanin was active from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Inoculum size had a minimal effect on MICs, and increased concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter MICs or MBCs.
TI  - Hemolytic interactions of Dermatophilus congolensis.
AB  - The strains of Dermatophilus congolensis grew on blood agar with washed sheep erythrocytes with marked total hemolysis. In testing for hemolytic interactions they gave a significant synergistic effect of a characteristic shape with Rhodococcus equi and Streptococcus agalactiae, whereas with Staphylococcus aureus producing beta hemolysin and with Staphylococcus aureus producing delta hemolysin a simultaneous synergistic as well as antagonistic effect were observed. First of all a conspicuous inhibition of in the beta hemolysin zone began and then the hemolytic effect of D. congolensis was enhanced. A similar double reaction was also observed with Listeria ivanovii. With delta hemolysin there was an inhibition of the hemolytic effect of D. congolensis and at the same time a synergistic effect could be observed. Also D. congolensis gave a weak synergistic effect with Micrococcus lylae and Listeria monocytogenes, and a further weak antagonistic effect with alpha hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes and Micrococcus luteus. No interaction of D. congolensis was established with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.
TI  - Infectious arthritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - Eleven cases of infectious arthritis occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are reported. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in eight patients. Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus agalactiae in one patient each, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in two patients. The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 16 days in patients with pyogenic arthritis. The diagnosis of joint infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was especially delayed (57 days). Four patients died; they were found to have a longer time to diagnosis and two of them had multiple joint infection. Although Staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most often affecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis, infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis must also be considered in such patients.
TI  - Microbiologic investigation of an epizootic of mastitis caused by Serratia marcescens in a dairy herd.
AB  - An epizootic of subclinical and clinical mastitis caused by Serratia marcescens was investigated in a 1,000-cow dairy farm in California. Serratia marcescens was isolated from 13 to 18% of composite milk samples obtained from lactating dairy cows. During monthly milk sampling performed during a 4-month period, S marcescens was isolated from 38.8 to 62.3% of composite milk samples obtained from cows from which S marcescens was previously isolated. Few cows infected with S marcescens had evidence of clinical mastitis. Somatic cell count value was associated with isolation of S marcescens. Cows with somatic cell counts greater than 500,000 were 5.48 times as likely to have intramammary infections with S marcescens, compared with cows with somatic cell count less than or equal to 500,000. Lactation number also was associated with S marcescens intramammary infection. After adjusting for the effect of lactation number, cows with high somatic cell count values were 2.98 times as likely to have intramammary infection with S marcescens, compared with cows with low somatic cell counts. Infection with S marcescens was independent of days in lactation, production string, and daily milk production. Eleven months after the beginning of the epizootic, S marcescens was isolated from organic bedding samples obtained from the dairy. Despite numerous attempts, other sources of S marcescens could not be identified on this dairy.
TI  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis binds fibronectin.
AB  - Fibronectin, an adhesive glycoprotein which is present in plasma and on many host cell surfaces of many host organisms, binds to certain bacterial pathogens. This study demonstrates the ability of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (M.ptb) to interact with 125I-labelled fibronectin purified from bovine and ovine plasma. Two M.ptb strains were tested: a clinical isolate and a commercially available vaccine strain. Both strains showed significant fibronectin-binding activities of 22 and 41%, respectively, whereas non-pathogenic M.phlei had almost no affinity for fibronectin. Binding activities were similar for ovine and bovine fibronectin. We found that fibronectin binding by M.ptb was (1) time-dependent, reaching saturation within 90 min, (2) specific, since it was inhibited by an excess of unlabelled fibronectin but not by albumin, (3) saturable, with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.25 x 10(-9) M and a maximal number of 1,600 binding sites per bacterium, and (4) sensitive to detergents, proteases and heat treatments, indicating the protein nature of the responsible binding component(s). Scatchard plot analysis gave a straight line suggesting the presence of a single type of fibronectin receptor on M.ptb.
TI  - Adherence and colonization by bacterial pathogens in explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue.
AB  - Explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue taken from virgin heifers were used to  examine adherence, colonization and cytopathogenesis of Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in the putative target tissue. None of the five bacteria was able to adhere to healthy ductular epithelium but all showed a marked tropism for exposed connective tissue. S. aureus and E. coli induced a marked cytopathic effect in ductular epithelium after 6 hours in culture but the bacteria were not in close association with the affected tissue. No evidence could be found to support the hypothesis that adherence to epithelium might be the first stage in the pathogenesis of mastitis caused by these organisms.
TI  - Post-milking teat dip use in dairy herds with high or low somatic cell counts.
AB  - Milk samples for bacteriologic culture were submitted from 71 dairy herds, 24 with low somatic cell count (SCC) and 47 with high SCC and high prevalence of subclinical mastitis. At the time of sample submission to the Mastitis Diagnostic Laboratory of Pennsylvania State University, information regarding the herd mastitis control practices was collected. A combined program of post-milking teat dipping (PMTD) and antibiotic treatment of all cows at the start of the nonlactating period was practiced more frequently for herds with low SCC, (P less than 0.001) than for herds with high SCC. Among all herds for which PMTD was practiced, a higher proportion (P less than 0.001) of those for which chlorhexidine-based products were used had low SCC than high SCC. Conversely, a higher proportion of herds for which a dip with an acrylic latex barrier was used had high SCC rather than low SCC (P = 0.002). For herds with high prevalence of subclinical mastitis, and despite a program of PMTD and treatment of all cows at the start of the nonlactating period, a change to a different germicidal teat dip product may be indicated to help reduce prevalence of infection.
TI  - Microbiological results from milk samples obtained premilking and postmilking for the diagnosis of bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - Bacteriological culture results were compared between 336 pairs of quarter milk samples collected premilking and postmilking. Using a positive result on either premilking or postmilking samples as the definitive diagnosis, premilking sampling sensitivity was 91% for Staphylococcus aureus, 91% for coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 97% for Streptococcus other than agalactiae. Postmilking sampling sensitivities were 81, 45, and 58%, respectively, for the same pathogens. Requiring both premilking and postmilking samples for the definitive diagnosis, specificities were 92, 86, and 95% for premilking sampling alone and 96, 98, and 99% for postmilking sampling alone. Such differences in specificity would result in major differences in predictive value of a positive culture for herds with a low prevalence. Multiple isolates were significantly more common from premilking samples.
TI  - Influence by staphylococcal lipase on granulocyte metabolism and killing of bacteria.
AB  - Lipase purified from Staphylococcus aureus interferes with granulocyte phagocytic killing of S. aureus but not with killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus agalactiae group B. Lipase treatment of granulocytes did not influence bacterial adherence to the cells.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  - Flomoxef sodium (FMOX) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). Serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. Serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml) and N.D. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. FMOX was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected, and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. In 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. The results suggest that FMOX is useful and safe also in neonates.
TI  - Direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a DNA probe.
AB  - This study involved the rapid, direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (BACTEC, Johnston Laboratories, Inc.) by using the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) culture confirmation test. This method uses a chemiluminescent DNA probe that detects the rRNA of the target organisms. The manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. Two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. The first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml) from the blood culture bottle. The second method used a microcentrifuge and less volume (1 to 1.5 ml). A total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by AccuProbe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. The microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. When combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the AccuProbe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluations of cefdinir 10% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482)  (10% fine granules), a new oral cephem, were performed in pediatrics. 1. Bioequivalencies of plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of CFDN 5% and 10% fine granules were investigated on 3 pediatric patients with ages between 5 to 13 years administered with a drug in fasting state at a dose level of 3 mg/kg using a cross over method. Average plasma concentrations in a group of patients administered with 5% fine granules peaked at 3 hours after administration with a level of 1.05 +/- 0.29 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.) and decreased to 0.12 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.48 +/- 0.09 hours. In the group administered with 10% fine granules, average plasma concentrations peaked at 2 hours after administration with a level of 1.32 +/- 0.12 micrograms/ml, and decreased to 0.20 +/- 0.11 microgram/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.68 +/- 0.28 hours. The first 8-hour urinary recovery rates of CFDN in the 5% and 10% fine granules groups averaged 19.64 +/- 5.69% and 23.37 +/- 2.36%, respectively. Both average and individual plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates in the patients of the 10% fine granules group were somewhat higher than those of the 5% fine granules group, but no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups including areas under concentrations. 2. CFDN 10% fine granule preparation was administered to 33 pediatric patients with ages between 1 to 13 years with various infections, and its clinical effects, bacteriological effects and safety were assessed. In 31 of the 33 patients (2 patients were excluded since they were with non-bacterial infections) clinical effects were excellent in all of 9 patients with scarlet fever (3), acute pharyngitis (3) or impetigo (3), excellent in 12 and good in 3 of 15 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, and excellent in 4 and good in 3 of 7 patients with acute pneumonia. The overall efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriological effects against causative organisms were evaluated. All the identified Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1) were eradicated. Of 10 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains were eradicated and the other one was reduced. Of 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae 4 were eradicated, 1 persisted and the fate of the remaining 2 were unknown. The overall eradication rate was 90.0%. Microbial substitutions were observed in 5 patients. The new, replacing bacteria were all Haemophilus spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ampicillin-aminoglycoside combinations as initial treatment for neonatal septicaemia or meningitis. A retrospective evaluation of 12 years' experience.
AB  - In a retrospective study covering the years 1975-1986, 341 episodes of invasive infections in 338 newborn infants were evaluated. Of the 365 pathogens isolated from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, 91% were sensitive to either ampicillin or aminoglycosides or both. Ampicillin resistance was mainly found in very low and low birthweight infants with late-onset infections, in which aerobic Gram-negative rods were common pathogens. In contrast, aminoglycoside resistance was common in early-onset infections, due to the dominance of group B streptococcal infections. The ampicillin-aminoglycoside combination had been given as initial treatment in 189 cases of septicaemia or meningitis. Treatment failed in 36 infections (20%), although all organisms were sensitive to one or both antibiotics. Treatment failed in 6 of 34 patients with meningitis but the failure was not related to ampicillin or aminoglycoside resistance. In conclusion, both in vitro and clinical results show that the ampicillin-aminoglycoside combination can be used as initial treatment of invasive infections in neonates.
TI  - Pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle that is endemic in the tropics and is being recognized with increasing frequency in temperate climates. We report two cases of nonendemic pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus. A review of the literature suggests that diabetes mellitus may be an important risk factor for the development of pyomyositis. Possible mechanisms of this association are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of RU29246 (HR916 metabolite) compared with four other oral beta-lactams tested against more than 5000 clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of RU29246, the active metabolite of the oral cephalosporin ester HR916, was compared in a multicenter study with that of the four oral beta-lactam antibiotics cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanate (amoxicillin/CA). RU29246 was generally 2- to 8-fold more active than the other oral cephalosporins and comparable to amoxicillin/CA against staphylococci, and was the most active cephalosporin against group B streptococci. All four cephalosporins were ineffective against enterococci. RU29246 was the only cephalosporin consistently active against Acinetobacter, but all beta-lactam antibiotics had poor activity against Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia. RU29246 was comparable to cefixime and more active than the other cephalosporins against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, all of the antibiotics had poor activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Quality control reference ranges for the quality control organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 are proposed for the broth dilution method based on data derived from this multicenter study.
TI  - Growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species in bovine mammary secretions during the nonlactating and peripartum periods following intramammary infusion of lipopolysaccharide at cessation of milking.
AB  - The objective was to determine if induced mammary inflammation at cessation of milking influenced growth of gram-positive mastitis pathogens in mammary secretions, particularly during early involution. Growth of all mastitis pathogens evaluated was similar in cell-free fat-free mammary secretions from LPS-infused and control glands. These data indicate that intramammary infusion of LPS at cessation of milking did not alter growth of gram-positive mastitis pathogens in mammary secretion during the nonlactating period. Stage of lactation and the nonlactating period influenced bacterial growth and marked differences between bacteria and among strains of a bacterial species were observed. Staphylococcus aureus grew well in secretions collected during late lactation, but growth decreased during early- and mid-involution and increased again in secretions obtained near parturition. Streptococcus agalactiae and Strep. uberis grew better in mammary secretion obtained during involution than in secretions collected during late or early lactation. Streptococcus dysgalactiae grew well in mammary secretions at all time periods. These data demonstrate the variability of mastitis pathogen growth during physiologic transitions of the bovine udder.
TI  - Bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  - During delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. Due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells of respiratory nasal mucosa. Bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. Bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. In mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. Results of the study performed by usual methods revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. Gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.
TI  - Costs associated with selected preventive practices and with episodes of clinical mastitis in nine herds with low somatic cell counts.
AB  - Nine dairy herds (mean size, 149 cows) with bulk-tank milk somatic cell counts of less than 300,000 cells/ml and greater than 80% of cows with Dairy Herd Improvement Association linear somatic cell counts less than or equal to 4 were selected for study. Each herd was monitored for 12 consecutive months. Duplicate quarter-milk specimens were collected from each cow for bacteriologic culturing at beginning of lactation, cessation of lactation, and at the time of each clinical episode of mastitis. Streptococcus agalactiae was never isolated and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from less than 1% of all quarters. There were 554 episodes of clinical mastitis. During the year of study, the incidence rate of clinical mastitis varied from 15.6 to 63.7% of cows among the 9 herds. Mean costs per cow per year in herd for mastitis prevention were: $10 for paper towels, $3 for nonlactating cow treatment, and $10 for teat disinfectants. Mean cost associated with clinical mastitis was $107/episode. Approximately 84% ($90) of the costs attributed to a clinical episode were associated with decreased milk production and nonsalable milk. Costs of medication and professional veterinary fees per clinical episode varied significantly among the 9 herds. Three of the herds did not have a veterinarian treat a clinical episode of mastitis during the year of study even though 2 of these herds had the first and third highest incidence rates of clinical mastitis. When calculated on a per cow in herd basis, mean costs of $40/cow/year were attributed to clinical mastitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Mastitis prevalence in primigravid heifers at parturition.
AB  - Prevalence of intramammary infection was determined for 382 primigravid heifers within 3 d postpartum on 11 Vermont dairy farms. Data collected during a 5-yr period are summarized. Duplicate quarter milk samples were cultured on tryptose-blood agar plates containing .1% esculin. Intramammary infections were diagnosed in 45.5% of the heifers and 18.7% of quarters. Staphylococcus species were the most prevalent bacteria isolated: they appeared in 25.4% of the heifers and 12.1% of quarters. Only 2.6% of the heifers were diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus; 22.8% had udder infection caused by other staphylococcal species. Environmental mastitis pathogens, coliforms, and streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae were isolated from 14.9% of the heifers and 4.8% of quarters. The prevalence of mastitis among these primigravid heifers at parturition indicates a need to improve methods of diagnosis and control programs.
TI  - Recovery of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus from fresh and frozen bovine milk.
AB  - Three hundred seventy-three milk samples were screened for Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. After sample storage at -20 C for 23 days, the frequency of Str agalactiae isolation increased 2.50 times. The frequency of S aureus isolation increased 1.48 times in the same interval. Increases in the proportion of these isolates were highly significant (P = 0.000006 and 0.0001, respectively). Results of the study indicate that optimal procedures for microbiological testing for these mastitis pathogens may include preculture freezing. The magnitude of the increase in the proportion of isolates indicates the existence of an important population of infected cattle shedding bacteria at concentrations not detected by use of standard microbiological techniques.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - Performance of a BACTEC nonradiometric medium for pediatric blood cultures.
AB  - A BACTEC aerobic nonradiometric medium, PEDS Plus, designed for diagnosis of pediatric bacteremia was evaluated in three hospital centers. Equivalent blood volumes (up to 5 ml) were inoculated into and incubated in BACTEC NR-6A (6A) and PEDS Plus broths. Among 4,581 compliant sets, 289 clinically significant organisms, representing more than 20 bacterial and two Candida species, were isolated. One hundred eighty-one isolates were recovered in both bottles, 75 in PEDS Plus only, and 33 in 6A only (P less than 0.001). Time to detection when both bottles were positive was the same for 129 isolates, detection with PEDS Plus was earlier for 39, and detection with 6A was earlier for 13 (P less than 0.005). Staphylococcus aureus was recovered significantly more often in PEDS Plus than in 6A (P less than 0.01), and more coagulase-negative staphylococci and pediatric pathogens (pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus agalactiae) were recovered in PEDS Plus than in 6A. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and H. influenzae were detected significantly earlier in PEDS Plus (P less than 0.05 and less than 0.01, respectively). When the eight species of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated were considered together, recovery in PEDS Plus was better than in 6A (P less than 0.05). For 66 of the 143 isolates from patients known to be on antimicrobial therapy at the time blood was drawn, PEDS Plus was superior to 6A. In 45 cases, organisms were isolated from PEDS Plus only (P less than 0.001) and in 21 cases they were isolated from PEDS Plus before 6A (P less than 0.01). PEDS Plus broth aids diagnosis of pediatric bacteremia by increasing recovery of etiologic agents and decreasing the time required for detection.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - CAMP-reaction among skin isolates obtained from a dog with an acute squamous eczema.
AB  - The primary culture of a clinical specimen obtained from a dog with an acute squamous eczema revealed 3 different bacterial cultures. Two of these cultures, a beta-hemolytic Staphylococcus aureus and a group B streptococcal culture, demonstrated synergistic hemolytic activities on this primary culture plate. The group B streptococcus had the serotype surface antigens Ib/c, protein antigen c in its c beta component.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Incidence and etiology of neonatal septicaemia and meningitis in western Sweden 1975-1986.
AB  - In a retrospective study of neonatal septicaemia and meningitis in a defined region of western Sweden 1975-1986, 231 cases were identified. The incidence was 2.8/1000 live births. The case-fatality rate was 15%. thirty-three patients had meningitis. Only 55 patients (24%) had no known risk factors. Preterm delivery was a most important risk factor for both morbidity and mortality. The most common causative organisms were group B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and aerobic Gram-negative rods, together isolated from 82% of the patients. The cases were approximately equally divided between very early, early and late onset infections. Group B streptococci were over-represented in very early onset infections in all birthweight groups and aerobic Gram-negative rods were the most common isolates from low birthweight infants with late onset infections. However, group B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative rods were found in all birthweight and gestational age groups. Thus, initial antimicrobial therapy must be equally broad in all neonates with suspected septicaemia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Detection of causative bacteria for bovine mastitis and their susceptibility to  beta-lactam antibacterial agents].
AB  - During the period from November 1988 to May 1989, causative bacteria in a total of 172 clinical mastitis cases observed in 66 farms in 5 districts with 6 areas in Japan were examined and frequencies of their occurrences were determined. Susceptibilities (in MICs) of the isolates to 6 beta-lactam antibacterial agents were also determined. As a result, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was identified in 94 out of 172 cases (54.7%) and were the most prevalent. Corynebacterium spp., Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were found in 52 (30.2%), 49 (28.5%) and 43 (25.0%) cases, respectively. Four species of Streptococcus family (S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis and S. bovis) were identified in a total of 58 cases (33.7%). Susceptibility testing of CNS to cefoperazone (CPZ), cefazolin (CEZ), benzylpenicillin (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) showed that all MIC80's (inhibiting bacterial growth of 80% of all isolates) were within a range from 0.10 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and that there was no marked differences in antibacterial effects among the antibiotics used. The highest antibacterial effect on S. aureus was exhibited by MCIPC, which inhibited the growth of all isolates at 0.39 microgram/ml. The MICs of DMPPC against all isolates of S. aureus were 3.13 micrograms/ml or less and no methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was detected. There was no difference in antibacterial activities against Streptococcus family between penicillin antibiotics (DMPPC, MCIPC, ABPC and PCG) and cephem antibiotics (CPZ and CEZ), both of which showed excellent antibacterial activities. Cephem antibiotics exhibited higher activities against Gram-negative bacteria than penicillin antibiotics. Especially CPZ, the third generation cephem, showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., as well as against other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Study of haemolytic activity of some Campylobacter spp. on blood agar plates.
AB  - A total of 152 strains of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, C. laridis and C. fetus  subsp. fetus were tested for haemolysis on blood agar plates. Distinct haemolysis was detected in 92.3% (96/104) of strains of C. jejuni and 21.7% (5/23) of strains of C. coli on sheep blood heart infusion agar after incubation for 4 d microaerobically at 42 degrees C. Haemolysis was also detected on horse blood heart infusion agar. Haemolysis was not detected at 37 degrees C except with one of 50 strains of C. jejuni tested at this temperature, which was weakly positive. Campylobacter laridis was not haemolytic; C. fetus subsp. fetus, which does not grow at 42 degrees C, showed no haemolysis at 37 degrees C. Blood agar (Oxoid, BA Base No. 2) was not suitable for testing for haemolysis by these organisms. A microaerobic gas mixture containing hydrogen is better than that containing nitrogen because the medium has a brighter colour, making haemolysis easier to detect. There was no synergistic haemolysis with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. The plate haemolysis test as described here may aid differentiation within the thermophilic campylobacters.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - A case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis.
AB  - The group B streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. Group B streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. We report here an unusual case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis. Pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally, Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. Diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. The response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. This report describes a diabetic patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.
TI  - Efficacy of chlorhexidine as a postmilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of bovine mastitis during lactation.
AB  - A natural exposure trial was conducted for 12 mo in a herd of 150 lactating Jersey cows to determine efficacy of a .35% chlorhexidine teat dip containing a glycerine emollient for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections. Right teats of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal and left teats were not dipped. The herd was free of Streptococcus agalactiae and had a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus. Most new major pathogen intramammary infections resulted from Streptococcus species, primarily Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. New infections by Streptococcus species were significantly lower in teats dipped in chlorhexidine than in undipped teats. Overall efficacy of the chlorhexidine teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 50%. The experimental teat dip also reduced coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species infections 49.0% and Corynebacterium bovis infections 65.2%. Overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 54.0%. No irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat dip was observed.
TI  - Evaluation of a chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide teat dip under experimental and natural exposure conditions.
AB  - A postmilking teat dip containing chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide was evaluated by experimental challenge and in two herds under natural exposure. The test product had an efficacy of 78.9% against Staphylococcus aureus and 52.5% against Streptococcus agalactiae in the experimental challenge trial. The product was compared with a 1% iodine product in a 15-mo natural exposure study. Post-dipping with chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide reduced incidence of udder infection by major mastitis pathogens 36.1% when data were combined from the two herds. The 1% iodine and the chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide products were not equivalent for major mastitis pathogens; the test product was more effective. Incidence of udder infection by environmental mastitis pathogens was reduced 36.8% in both herds combined. Efficacy of the two teat dips was equivalent for environmental pathogens.
TI  - Plus-origin mapping of single-stranded DNA plasmid pE194 and nick site homologies with other plasmids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. Like most characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pE194 generates single-stranded DNA. The direction of pE194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded DNA. Significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pE194 and sequences present in plasmids pMV158 (Streptococcus agalactiae), pADB201 (Mycoplasma mycoides), and pSH71 (Lactococcus lactis). We used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pE194 initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pMV158 sequence, to demonstrate that pE194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.
TI  - [Efficacy of a modified formula dry cow preparation for dairy cattle containing 600 mg cloxacillin].
AB  - The efficacy of a dry cow preparation containing 600 mg of cloxacillin in a modified formulation was investigated in 177 cows on 44 Dutch dairy farms. The cure-rate of 43 quarters infected with the most common udder pathogenic Streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae) was 100%. The cure-rate of 146 quarters infected with Staphylococcus aureus was 71.9%. The number of new infections during the dry period was low (3.4%).
TI  - Transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance in Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - A strain of Listeria monocytogenes, isolated from a patient with meningoencephalitis, was resistant to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pIP811, that was self-transferable to other L monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to Staphylococcus aureus. The efficacy of transfer and the stability of pIP811 were higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. As indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pIP811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. Plasmid pIP811 shared extensive sequence homology with pAM beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. These results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in Listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. The dissemination of resistance to other strains of L monocytogenes is likely.
TI  - Mastitis control services and utilization of milk somatic cell count data by veterinarians in Ohio.
AB  - A telephone survey was conducted of 50 randomly selected Ohio-licensed veterinarians engaged in dairy practice. The survey's purpose was to determine the extent of mastitis control services offered by practitioners and to assess their utilization of milk somatic cell count (SCC) data on individual cows available from the Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA). During the preceding year, 96% (48/50) of practitioners surveyed had performed bacteriologic culture of milk samples. Practitioners were twice as likely to have performed culture on milk from mastitic cows that failed to respond to treatment as they were to have performed culture for purposes of identifying pathogen trends within a herd. Veterinarians in predominantly dairy practices were more likely to have completed bacteriologic examination of milk in their own laboratories than were veterinarians who were engaged in less than 50% dairy practice (P = 0.016). Most veterinarians (83%) reported that coagulase test results were available or that Staphylococcus aureus was differentiated from other staphylococcal species. Streptococcus agalactiae was not differentiated from other streptococcal species by 35% of practitioners surveyed. For veterinarians with clients enrolled in the DHIA, 91% (43/47) reported looking at, discussing, or otherwise using the DHIA records. Eighty-one percent (35/43) of veterinarians who had clients using services from the DHIA reported that clients also received individual cow milk SCC results. Veterinarians engaged in predominantly, dairy practice expressed a greater familiarity with the linear score method of SCC reporting than did veterinarians whose practices were less than 50% dairy (P = 0.085); however, both groups reported a preference for raw SCC data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Sequestration of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in somatic cells during experimental bovine mastitis induced by endotoxin, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Experimental mastitis was induced in cows by intramammary infusion of endotoxin,  Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. The inflammatory response was monitored by somatic cell counting and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase). NAGase activity was analysed in fresh milk samples in parallel with samples treated by a cycle of freezing and thawing combined with detergent treatment to release the cell-bound NAGase. Before the udder reacted by inflammation, the total NAGase activity consisted of free extracellular activity. Later on when the inflammation was established, much of the milk NAGase remained sequestered intracellularly. S agalactiae was linked with a high degree of cellular NAGase sequestration indicating a blockage of the lysosomal release function from the phagocytes. S aureus delayed the inflammatory response.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate teat dip.
AB  - The activity of a 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate postmilking teat germicide in reducing the numbers of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae on the skin of excised teats from cows was determined. The product yielded logarithmic reductions of 4.09 and 4.10 against S aureus and Str agalactiae, respectively, compared with 3.80 and 3.81 reductions, using a 1% iodophor dip. Germicide tolerance to an organic load containing Serratia marcescens or Pseudomonas spp was also determined. Organisms were not recovered from the product 8 hours after introduction of a simulated organic load containing either species of bacteria. The germicide was further evaluated against S aureus and Str agalactiae, using experimental challenge-exposure procedures in a research dairy herd. Efficacy was 73.4% (P less than 0.001) against S aureus and 68.1% (P less than 0.005) against Str agalactiae.
TI  - Clinical mastitis in two California dairy herds participating in contagious mastitis control programs.
AB  - The occurrence of clinical mastitis in two large California dairy herds over a 3-yr period is described. Herds had been participating for 15 or 22 yr in mastitis control programs against Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, had low bulk tank SCC, and had maintained good standards of hygiene and husbandry, but clinical mastitis remained a serious problem. A total of 1654 clinical mastitis cases were detected; the annual incidence in each herd was 49%. Coliform bacteria and environmental streptococci were etiological agents in 60% of the total clinical mastitis cases; coliforms produced 1.6 times more clinical mastitis than environmental streptococci. A higher susceptibility to clinical mastitis, primarily from coliform bacteria and environmental streptococci, was found in the first months of lactation. Clinical mastitis incidence peaked for cows in lactations 4 and 5 and was lowest during the first lactation. Highest incidence of clinical mastitis due to coliform bacteria and environmental streptococci at each dairy occurred during the rainy season (late fall and winter).
TI  - Complement C3 deposition onto bacteria by neonatal serum is not enhanced after the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin.
AB  - To determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on the capacity of serum from septic neonates to deposit complement C3 and IgG onto the bacteria isolated from their blood, 500 mg/kg of IVIG was administered to 18 neonates suspected of being septic. Blood was obtained just before the infusion, and again 15 minutes after its completion. Group B streptococcus type II, group B streptococcus type III, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from the pre-infusion blood of four neonates. Bacteria were incubated with the appropriate serum, washed, and the amount of C3 and IgG subsequently bound to the organisms was quantified by radioimmunobinding assay. Sera from the four septic neonates and sera from four neonates of similar gestational age but whose blood cultures were negative were compared with pooled sera from healthy adults. Before the administration of IVIG, C3 deposition onto the bacteria by sera from five of the seven neonates tested was significantly less than that observed for adult sera. Following the infusion, no increase in C3 deposition was observed for any of the seven sera assayed, and in two cases C3 deposition fell significantly. In contrast, in seven of eight cases, IVIG enhanced the IgG deposition to levels greater than or equal to those observed for adult sera. Therefore, following the infusion of IVIG into neonates with proven or suspected sepsis, the deposition of C3 onto invasive bacteria by their serum was not enhanced even though IgG deposition was increased.
TI  - Effect of postmilking teat antisepsis on teat canal infections in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - Effects of a .18% iodophor teat dip and a fatty acid plus lactic acid teat dip on teat canal infections were studied in two separate trials under experimental challenge procedures using Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The iodophor teat dip was 90% effective in preventing new S. aureus teat canal infections and 95.6% effective in reducing progression of S. aureus teat canal infections to intramammary infections. The dip also reduced persistence of S. aureus teat canal colonizations from week to week by 94.4%. The fatty acid plus lactic acid dip had no effect on preventing S. aureus teat canal infections but reduced progression of S. aureus teat canal infections to intramammary infections by 43.8%. The fatty acid plus lactic acid dip also reduced the persistence of S. aureus teat canal infections by 39%. An insufficient number of Strep. agalactiae teat canal infections was detected in both trials for valid analyses. Neither dip had any effect on prevalence of naturally occurring, coagulase-negative staphylococcal teat canal infections or on teat canal infections by other organisms.
TI  - [Osteoarticular infections in newborn infants].
AB  - The authors report 13 cases of osteoarticular infection observed during the first month of life. The origin was iatrogenic in 7 cases. The diagnosis was based on local inflammatory signs and standard X-ray. The joints most often affected were the hip (8 out of 19 localizations) and the ankle (5/19). The causative bacteria was mostly isolated from blood culture (10/13 cases) and was staphylococcus aureus in 11 cases. Treatment included prolonged antibiotic-therapy for 1-4 months, plus evacuation by joint punctures and immobilization of the affected limb with a plaster or traction. Functional sequellae were observed in 3 children and essentially concerned the hip.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - The effect of pre-enrichment on recovery of Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma from bovine milk.
AB  - The study was conducted to determine whether pre-enrichment would increase sensitivity of detecting Streptococcus (Str.) agalactiae, Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, and mycoplasma in bovine milk. Two procedures were followed, one involving direct inoculation of milk on bovine blood agar, and the other involving preenrichment in broth followed by inoculation on agar. Logistic regression was used to predict the probability of isolation as a function of culture procedure and two additional covariates, the California Mastitis Test (CMT) score of the milk and the type of sample (indicating sample storage temperature and herd mastitis status). A total of 13778 milk samples was cultured for each of the three bacteria. By using results of both direct inoculation and pre-enrichment, the probability of isolation compared to use of direct inoculation only and adjusted for effects of other variables was increased 3.6-fold for Str. agalactiae, 1.6-fold for S. aureus and 1.7-fold for mycoplasma. The probability of isolation for all three bacteria increased as the CMT score increased. For Str. agalactiae, there was a statistical interaction predicting that enrichment improved the odds of isolation more from milk with high CMT scores than from milk with low scores. Results indicate that pre-enrichment can substantially increase the sensitivity of bacteriological screening of dairy cows for mastitis caused by Str. agalactiae, S. aureus, and mycoplasma.
TI  - [The in vitro effects of josamycin on various strains of bacteria].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration of josamycin was studied by the dilution plate method on the strains Staphylococcus aureus, plasmacoagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and enterococci. The effect of josamycin was compared with that of erythromycin, penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazol, and furantion. Of the series of 572 strains tested, josamycin was most effective in the strains Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. All the strains tested were susceptible to josamycin, including the Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to erythromycin. Of the plasmacoagulase negative staphylococci 2.6% resistant strains and 86.3% strains with decreased susceptibility were found. Of the enterococci 41.2% of the strains were resistant to josamycin. In these strains the most effective antibiotics were ampicillin and furantoin.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in infections of neonates].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated for its absorption and excretion as well as for therapeutic effectiveness in neonates and premature infants. The following results were obtained. 1. Serum concentrations of the drug were examined in 3 premature infants 1 to 11 days old upon intravenous administration of about 10 mg/kg body weight (1st group), in 2 premature infants 18 and 32 days old and 1 neonate 17 days old upon intravenous administration of about 20 mg/kg (2nd group), and in 1 neonate 15 days old with meningitis upon intravenous administration of 45.2 mg/kg. Concentrations of CMX at 30 minutes after administration were 43, 29 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 46, 37 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 208 micrograms/ml in the other neonate, and appeared to be dose-dependent. Concentrations of CMX at 6 hours after administration were 18.2, 6.6 and 8.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 9.6, 11 and 1.35 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 5.2 micrograms/ml in the other subject. Serum half-lives were, respectively, 4.59, 2.85 and 3.48 hours in the 1st group, 2.52, 2.73 and 1.14 hours in the 2nd group and 1.0 hour in the other subject. Urinary recovery rates during the first 6 hours after administration were 45.8, 87.0, 50.2 and more than 100% in 4 cases examined. Two of these cases, in which recovery rates were 45.8 and 50.2%, were premature infants of low birth weight. Spinal fluid concentrations of the drug at 80 to 90 minutes after dosing to 1 neonate with purulent meningitis (causative organism presumed: Escherichia coli) given 48.3 mg/kg tended to decline gradually with the recovery of the disease, 3.8, 1.72 and 1.32 micrograms/ml on the 2nd, 6th and 8th day, respectively. 2. The drug was given to 9 neonates 0 to 24 days old. The therapeutic effectiveness on bacterial infections was evaluated in 7 cases (10 diseases) including 1 disease of purulent meningitis presumably caused by E. coli, 4 of septicemia caused by E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (1, 2 and 1, respectively), 3 of urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, Serratia and Enterococcus faecalis (1 each), 1 of purulent parotitis caused by S. aureus and 1 of pneumonia (causative organism was unknown). Therapeutic efficacies were assessed as "Excellent" in all of meningitis, septicemia and urinary tract infection cases, and "Good" in 1 each of purulent parotitis and pneumonia cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic whey in relation to bacterial association with mastitis.
AB  - The growth of mastitis pathogens (eight strains) and non-pathogenic bacteria (eight strains) was studied using microturbidometry. All bacteria grew well in whey originating from uninflamed quarters. However, the growth of bacteria which are not considered to be mastitis pathogens (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) became suppressed by whey from mastitic quarters. On the contrary, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was generally better in mastitic samples. Streptococcus agalactiae showed inconsistent results.
TI  - New receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  - 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of S. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of S. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group G streptococci and 14/14 strains of S. pneumoniae. Eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. S. equisimilis demonstrated the highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). On the other hand, all strains of S. agalactiae, the majority of S. faecalis and all S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. The concentration of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mM. These estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. Binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. Binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the B-chain region. As streptokinase interacts mainly with the B-chain of plasmin it is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.
TI  - Changes in milk plasminogen, plasmin and in vitro bacterial growth in whey during early lactation.
AB  - The activity of milk plasmin, plasminogen and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGase) and the trypsin-inhibitor capacity (TIC) were monitored in 40 quarters during the first month of lactation. TIC and NAGase activity decreased rapidly and plasmin activity more slowly during the first week. Conversely milk plasminogen increased as time elapsed from parturition. When the quality of whey was analysed as a growth medium for mastitis pathogens, a slight inhibition in the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was seen at the day of parturition. There was a distinct stimulatory effect on the growth of Str. agalactiae during the second week of lactation. No relationship was found between in vitro bacterial growth and respective plasmin or plasminogen activity in milk.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Similarity of minus origins of replication and flanking open reading frames of plasmids pUB110, pTB913 and pMV158.
AB  - Plasmids pMV158 and pTB913, originating from Streptococcus agalactiae and a thermophilic Bacillus respectively, were sequenced to completion. Both contained a BA3-type minus origin of replication and an RSA-site, believed to constitute a site-specific recombination site. These two regions were more than 99% homologous to the corresponding regions of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110. Deleting the BA3-type minus origin resulted in the accumulation of a considerable amount of single-stranded DNA, both in L. lactis subsp. lactis and B. subtilis, indicating that this minus origin was functional in both bacterial species. Like pUB110, both plasmids contained an open reading frame encoding a putative plasmid recombination enzyme (Pre protein), which was located downstream of the RSA-site. On the basis of sequence comparisons between pUB110, pMV158, pTB913, pT181, pE194, pNE131 and pT48 two distinct families of RSA-sites and Pre proteins could be distinguished.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Automatic application of teat disinfectant through the milking machine cluster.
AB  - An automatic device, which infuses disinfectant into the mouthpiece of the liner  of the milking machine cluster as teatcups are removed, is described. Application at this time avoids any delay in disinfection, reduces the workload in the parlour and increases reliability of application. The teats of 20 cows were contaminated before each milking by immersion in a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae and then disinfected manually or automatically with iodophor after milking. Str. agalactiae was recovered from less than 5% of swabs and there was no difference between the results from the two methods. Neither method of disinfection was as effective against Staph. aureus and the recovery rate was significantly greater for the automatic method for both swabs from teat barrel (P less than 0.05) and teat apex (P less than 0.001). Rates of intramammary infection for quarters automatically or manually disinfected were similar and low (3/40 v. 6/40 respectively). The automatic method facilitates cluster removal by relieving vacuum and decreasing frictional contact at the mouthpiece lip, and utilizes approximately half the quantity of disinfectant used by manual dipping (0.9 v. 1.9 ml/teat). However, iodine contamination in the milk from the iodophor teat disinfectant was significantly increased from 14.4 to 102.2 micrograms 12/100 ml milk when no backflushing was practised.
TI  - Incidence of clinical mastitis on farms with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
AB  - A total of 1140 clinical cases of mastitis, with at least one inflamed quarter, were reported on 125 farms with somatic cell counts in bulk milk less than 150,000/ml. The average annual incidence was 17.9 cases per 100 cows and ranged from none to 80 cases per 100 cows. The microorganisms most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli (16.2 per cent), coagulase negative staphylococci (13.0 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus (9.6 per cent) and Streptococcus uberis (8.0 per cent). Only two cases of Streptococcus agalactiae were found. As the incidence of clinical mastitis increased, the proportion of S aureus also increased, while the proportions of E coli, S uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae remained about the same. Most of the clinical cases of mastitis occurred in early lactation, in November, December and January. However, after correction for the number of calvings per month, the incidence of mastitis was highest in the early summer months.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of glycolytic and cytoskeletal inhibitors on phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive activities of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Phagocytic and oxidative metabolic activities of bovine blood neutrophils were determined in the presence of glycolytic (NaF) and cytoskeletal (colchicine, cytochalasin B, and prostaglandin E1) inhibitors. Phagocytosis and post-phagocytic oxidative metabolic activity, measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, were determined using zymosan, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Sodium fluoride (1.25 microM to 1.25 mM concentrations) did not significantly (P greater than 0.05) inhibit phagocytosis of S aureus and Str agalactiae, whereas phagocytosis of zymosan and E coli was significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited only at 1.25 mM concentration. Colchicine at 1.25 nM to 1.25 microM concentrations significantly inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and E coli, but not of S aureus and Str agalactiae. Cytochalasin B at 1.25 nM to 1.25 microM concentrations significantly inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and all 3 bacteria, whereas prostaglandin E1 was noninhibitory at similar concentrations. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, in general, was not significantly affected by NaF and cytoskeletal inhibitors.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a cohemolysin, the CAMP factor of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - The genetic determinant of the cohemolysin which is responsible for the CAMP phenomenon, a cohemolysis, of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was cloned in Escherichia coli. Total DNA from the A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 type strain 4074 was used to construct a gene library in plasmid pUC18 in E. coli JM83. A total of 10,500 clones containing recombinant plasmids have been screened for hemolysis on blood plates. Fifty-five clones which showed a weak hemolytic response after 24 to 48 h of incubation were screened for the CAMP reaction with Staphylococcus aureus. This led to the identification of one clone which showed a positive CAMP reaction. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the recombinant strain expressed a protein with a molecular mass of 27,000 daltons, similar in size to the CAMP protein of the group B streptococci. Rabbit antibodies against the CAMP+ clone neutralized the CAMP reaction mediated by the E. coli strain containing the cloned CAMP gene as well as that of A. pleuropneumoniae. Antibodies raised against the cloned CAMP cohemolysin cross-reacted with Streptococcus agalactiae protein B. We designate the 27,000-dalton molecule CAMP factor protein and name its corresponding gene cfp.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - Field survey of clinical mastitis in low somatic cell count herds.
AB  - Nine commercial dairy herds, each with low herd milk somatic cell counts, were monitored for 1 yr to determine prevalence of intramammary infections and rates of clinical mastitis. Staphylococcus species was the bacterial group most frequently isolated from quarters at calving and at drying off. Environmental streptococci and coliform intramammary infections totaled less than 6% of quarters at both calving and at drying off. Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from less than 1% of quarters and Streptococcus agalactiae from 0% of quarters at both calving and drying off. A total of 646 clinical cases of mastitis were diagnosed in 548 quarters of 406 cows. Mean rate of clinical mastitis among herds was .457 clinical cases/305 cow-days. Rates of clinical mastitis ranged among herds from .273 to .748 clinical cases/305 cow-days. Coliforms and bacteriologically negative and environmental streptococci accounted for 82.3% of clinical cases. Rates of clinical mastitis and severity of clinical signs differed among herds, seasons of the year, parity groups, and stages of lactation. Rates of clinical mastitis were highest during summer, in first lactation cows, and during the first 7 d of lactation.
TI  - 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin (TMC-016): synthesis and biological properties of  a unique 16-membered macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin was synthesized by the following synthetic route:  19-Deformylation of desmycosin, 3,2',4''-tri-O-trimethylsilylation, 4'-O-sulfonylation, 4'-iodination, reductive deiodination and 3,2',4''-tri-O-detrimethylsilylation. Deformylation of the aldehyde group at the C-19 position was achieved by two different methods: A) A simple one-step deformylation using Wilkinson's catalyst ((Ph3P)3RhCl). B) Reductive decarboxylation of the 19-carboxyl derivative following NaClO2 oxidation of the aldehyde. 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin showed very strong antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Cost of mastitis and its prevention in four dairy cattle herds on St Croix, US Virgin Islands.
AB  - Nonclinical mastitis in the dairy herds on St Croix, US Virgin Islands, represents a prevalent (97%) and severe problem (44% of quarters had California Mastitis Test results of 2 or 3). Streptococcus agalactiae (26%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%) were the most prevalent pathogens. More than half (54%) of all organisms isolated and tested for resistance were resistant to ampicillin and benzyl penicillin; 29% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfadiazine. Estimates of the loss of milk production suggested that there was a loss of 4.40 to 13.33 lb/cow/day. The yearly economic cost of prevention was estimated for each cow ($22.07); yearly income loss attributable to mastitis was estimated to be from $339 to $1,022/cow/yr. Suggestions for the prevention and control of mastitis are included.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results were as follow: 1. A total of 27 patients consisting of 17 mature and 10 immature infants were treated with IPM/CS. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, and it was administered 2 approximately 3 times daily, in a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 approximately 12 days. The clinical efficacy of IPM/CS in 10 patients with bacterial infections (2 with sepsis, 3 with suspected sepsis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with acute omphalitis) was evaluated as excellent in all patients, with an efficacy rate of 100%. All 5 causative organisms found in 5 patients (Staphylococcus aureus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Escherichia coli in 2 and Flavobacterium meningosepticum in 1) were eradicated. Among 27 patients administered IPM/CS, adverse reactions were observed in 2 patients. These were rash and diarrhea. As for abnormal laboratory test values, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed. 2. MICs of IPM against 14 clinical isolates (S. epidermidis 1, S. aureus 6, Streptococcus agalactiae 4, E. coli 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1 and F. meningosepticum 1) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. IPM showed good antibacterial activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against S. agalactiae; however, the activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus was poor. 3. Serum levels of IPM and CS were investigated in a total of 22 patients consisting of 15 mature and 7 immature infants after 20 mg/20 mg/kg of IPM/CS was administered. IPM and CS produced peak serum levels at the end of the drip infusion. In mature infants, peak serum levels of IPM and CS were 31.8 micrograms/ml (17.1 approximately 59.0 micrograms/ml) and 59.9 micrograms/ml (35.6 approximately 99.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. In low birth weight infants, these were 25.0 micrograms/ml (16.8 approximately 41.8 micrograms/ml) and 55.2 micrograms/ml (33.8 approximately 82.4 micrograms/ml), respectively. Half-lives of IPM and CS were 1.0 approximately 2.7 hrs. and 0.9 approximately 7.4 hrs. in mature infants, and 1.6 approximately 3.0 hrs. and 1.3 approximately 9.7 hrs. in immature infants, respectively. Generally the longer half-lives were observed in the younger neonates. Serum levels of CS remained higher and half-lives of CS were longer than those of IPM. The pharmacokinetics in neonates were different from those in adults or children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Impetigo in children: etiology and response to treatment].
AB  - Seventy seven cases of impetigo were studied in children. Group A beta hemolyticus Streptococcus was the only bacterial agent isolated from 25 culture samples, Staphylococcus aureus from 6 and both agents from 39 cases. Cultures were negative in 7 children. The clinical response to treatment with penicillin G benzathine, crust removal and skin cleansing was satisfactory in 93.5% of the cases, nonresponders (6.5%) were satisfactory treated oral with cloxacillin.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Efficacy of .18% iodine teat dip against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus  agalactiae.
AB  - Effective postmilking teat dip products with lower iodine concentrations are being formulated as concern increases about iodine residues in milk. Increased free iodine concentration with greater germicidal activity in teat dip products is also possible with special formulation procedures. Low iodine concentration dips are cheaper and have reduced teat irritation. A concentrated iodine teat dip containing .18% iodine and 8 ppm free iodine upon dilution was evaluated under experimental bacterial challenge to determine efficacy for prevention of new intramammary infections. The undiluted product also contained 15% collagen protein emollient as a teat skin conditioner. Efficacy of the teat dip was 93.6 and 51. 7% for Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould 305) and Streptococcus agalactiae (McDonald 44). No adverse effects of the dip on teat skin were noted.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in samples of milk from cows studied for the causative  agent of mastitis].
AB  - Milk samples (483,413 on the whole), collected from 237,026 cows, were investigated in the State Veterinary Institute at Pardubice in the period from 1983 to 1987. In the individual years, the proportion of cows whose milk contained the mastitis-inducing bacteria ranged from 18.0 to 24.8%, the average being 21.0%. Streptococcus agalactiae was identified most frequently as the causative agent of mastitis in the examined cows (6.4%); then followed Streptococcus dysgalactiae (3.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.4%), and Streptococcus uberis (1.9%). The presence of the beta-haemolytic streptococci with group antigens C, G and L was demonstrated in the milk of 720 cows (i. e. 0.3%) and the remaining species of streptococci were identified in 1.0% of the cows. Coliform microorganisms were detected in 0.6% and Actinomyces pyogenes in 0.1% of the cows. The remaining bacterial species were isolated from the milk of 3.6% of the cows. Coaglucase-negative staphylococci dominated in this group. Over the five years of study, the occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae in the examined stocks declined from 10.8 to 3.5% but the occurrence of other streptococci and staphylococci increased.
TI  - Flotation of mastitis pathogens with cream from subclinically infected quarters.  Prospects for developing a cream-rising test for detecting mastitis caused by major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial isolates, originating from 36 subclinically infected quarter milk samples, were labelled with 75Se and checked for cream-rising at various temperatures in a system analogous to the ABR test ("Abortus Bang Ringprobe"; the cream-rising test based on stained brucella organisms for detection of brucellosis). Diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were analyzed in experiments where labelled bacterial isolates were mixed with a number of quarter milk samples with known bacteriological status as well as samples from healthy control quarters. Creaming at 37 degrees C resulted in specific "recognization" as the bacterial isolates showed preferential flotation in the milk samples from which they had been isolated as well as is milk samples harbouring the same bacterial species. At lower creaming temperatures, the specificity was lost since all the isolates became concentrated in the cream phase irrespective of the milk sample. When comparing the specific recognization by cream of the respective bacteria, bacterial species vary: The prospects for developing diagnostic cream-rising tests for Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli seems promising, but less so for coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis. The mechanism behind the cream-rising of labelled bacteria at 37 degrees C seems to lie in specific fat globule membrane-bound immunity of IgA type. Therefore the milk fat globules from chronically infected quarters function as absorbents for the respective isolates. Flotation of bacteria with cream indicates an in vivo mechanism enabling bacteria to invade the upper parts of milk ducts within the udder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Neonatal septicaemia in Finland 1981-85. Predominance of group B streptococcal infections with very early onset.
AB  - A survey of blood culture-confirmed neonatal septicaemia was carried out in seven delivery hospitals in 1981-85, for a second successive five-year period. The total number of cases was 377, to compare with 410 in the previous five-year period. Group B streptococcus (GBS) was throughout the major pathogen (29%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Escherichia coli (14%), while Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%) has emerged as a significant new causative agent. Septicaemia with very early onset was predominant: 49% of the cases had onset within the first 24 hours; in the majority the symptoms were present from birth. GBS was responsible for 49% of the cases detected in the first 24 hours of life. The overall mortality was 20% as compared to 23% in the previous five-year period, whereas in the very early onset septicaemia mortality was now 18%, down from the preceding 30%. Despite the modest progress, GBS septicaemia with very early onset remains a significant problem, and effective preventive measures are needed.
TI  - Species-specific interpretive breakpoints for ciprofloxacin disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - When ciprofloxacin was introduced on the Swedish market the recommended interpretive standards for disk diffusion susceptibility testing using a 10 microgram disk were: Sensitive greater than or equal to 24 mm (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and Resistant less than 18 mm (MIC greater than 4 mg/l), except for enterococci where S greater than or equal to 18 mm and R less than 14 mm were recommended. A quality control study revealed that the accuracy of the routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin was low. 50% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 90% of Streptococcus agalactiae strains were falsely assigned to the intermediate instead of the sensitive category, and the test missed to detect true resistance in Pseudomonas maltophilia. New species-specific breakpoints were determined by the SRA method. Separate breakpoints were required only for the pseudomonas species. Streptococcus faecalis was found to belong mainly to the intermediate group and it is suggested that these strains are not categorized as sensitive. The breakpoints that gave acceptable accuracy in routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin were S greater than or equal to 20 mm, R less than 13 mm for all relevant bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which S greater than or equal to 27 mm, R less than 18 mm is proposed, and Pseudomonas maltophilia where S greater than or equal to 30 mm, R less than 23 mm are adequate breakpoints. The 10 microgram disk gave acceptable inhibition zones for all strains with MICs within the clinically interesting MIC range.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Group B streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  - Infection with group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of group B streptococci on C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Fresh human serum was activated to form C5a and C5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. The activated serum was then incubated with group B organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Group B organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in C-dependent chemotactic activity. The degree of inhibition was profound with 1 X 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). Experiments indicated that significant chemotactic factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to GBS organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. A number of different strains of GBS of types I, II, and III possessed inhibitory activity. In contrast, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Group A streptococci that were M protein positive also inactivated C-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. The inhibitory activity of the GBS strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. C5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by RIA were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain suggesting that absorption was not involved. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that group B streptococci degrade the C5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 Da. Thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of GBS infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate C-derived inflammatory mediators. The GBS C5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonatal infections].
AB  - Ten patients with infections (8 neonates and 2 infants) were treated with 10.2 mg/10.2 mg/kg-37.7 mg/37.7 mg/kg of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) b.i.d. or t.i.d. by a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. The plasma concentrations of IPM/CS were determined in 5 of the 10 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient of the 5. 1. The patients studied included 5 with pneumonia and 1 each with urinary tract infection, omphalitis, suspected meningitis, periproctal abscess and suspected septicemia. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 9 patients: the patient with suspected meningitis was excluded from the clinical evaluation because the infection was doubtfully due to bacteria. Responses were excellent in 4 and good in 5 patients. No patient with a poor response was observed. All of the 6 etiological isolates obtained from 5 patients (2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis) were eradicated. 2. As for side effects, rash was observed in 1 patient and petechiae accompanied by decreases in platelets and reticulocytes and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in another. Other abnormal laboratory test values in addition to the above abnormalities consisted of an increase in GPT in 1 patient and increases in GOT and GPT in another. These side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were mild and normalized after discontinuation or completion of IPM/CS administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Frequency of isolation of environmental mastitis-causing pathogens and incidence  of new intramammary infection during the nonlactating period.
AB  - Quarter samples (n = 6,328) of mammary secretions were collected from 160 cows during physiologic transitions of the udder to determine the frequency of isolation of mastitis-causing pathogens and the incidence of new intramammary infections (IMI) during the nonlactating period. None of the cows in the herd was infected with Streptococcus agalactiae, and the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was low. Cows were not treated with antibiotics at cessation of milking. A threefold increase in the percentage of quarters infected with major mastitis-causing pathogens developed from late lactation to early involution. Coliforms and streptococci other than Str agalactiae accounted for 94% of major pathogen infections. The number of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased slightly from late lactation to early involution, whereas the number of quarters infected with Corynebacterium bovis decreased markedly. Major pathogens caused 101 of 153 IMI at parturition and greater than 90% were caused by streptococci and coliforms. At parturition, 51 of 52 minor pathogen IMI were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. During early lactation, there was a marked decrease in quarters infected with major pathogens; however, the number of quarters with major pathogen IMI during early lactation was 2.3 times higher than the number of quarters infected before cessation of milking. The number of quarters with minor pathogen IMI during early lactation was the same as at parturition, but a marked decrease in quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and a marked increase in C bovis IMI developed from parturition to early lactation.

TI  - Effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  - Fibronectin (Fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)  with certain bacteria. Fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, of PMNLs to Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .05) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .01) but had no effect on type III, group B streptococci (GBS) or Escherichia coli. When GBS or E. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, Fn significantly enhanced the CL response of PMNLs (P less than .05). The intracellular metabolic inhibitor NaN3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited Fn-enhanced CL; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by Fn is an intracellular event. We used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of Fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by PMNLs. Fn alone promoted uptake and killing of S. aureus (P less than .01) and S. epidermidis (P less than .05) by PMNLs but did not enhance monolayer phagocytosis of GBS or E. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (P less than .01).
TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of latex agglutination tests used to identify Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank milk.
AB  - Comparisons were made among rapid latex agglutination tests and conventional biochemical tests used to identify Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Ninety-eight streptococci and 149 staphylococci isolated from bulk tank milk were tested. Sensitivity and specificity for the latex agglutination test used for identification of Str agalactiae were 97.6 and 98.2%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the latex agglutination test used for identification of S aureus were 90.2 and 67.5%, respectively. Of 25 staphylococci considered false-positive by the latex agglutination test, 14 (56%) were considered tube coagulase-positive. Fifteen staphylococci considered false-positive by latex agglutination test had biotypes representative of S hyicus of S xylosus.
TI  - Phagocytic and postphagocytic activities of bovine neutrophils for pure and mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  - A comparative study of phagocytosis and postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of bovine blood neutrophils incubated with pure and mixed cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae was preformed. Most neutrophils when incubated with mixed cultures showed preferential phagocytosis for one species and a smaller number phagocytized both species of microorganisms. Percent phagocytosis for E. coli in pure culture was similar to that of Strep. agalactiae in pure culture and higher than that for Staph. aureus in pure culture. Neutrophils incubated with mixed cultures of E. coli and Staph. aureus or E. coli and Strep. agalactiae showed greater than expected phagocytosis of each microorganisms alone and reduced phagocytosis of both microorganisms together. Postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of neutrophils, measured by percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, did not differ following phagocytosis of these three microorganisms in pure cultures. In comparison, a synergistic effect on nitroblue tetrazolium reductive activity was seen in mixed cultures as evidenced by higher percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction following phagocytosis of both E. coli and Staph. aureus or E. coli and Strep. agalactiae. These observations indicate that the phagocytic and metabolic activities of neutrophils for bacteria in mixed cultures may not be identical to those in pure cultures.
TI  - Prevalence of udder infections and mastitis in 50 California dairy herds.
AB  - The California mastitis test (CMT) and bacteriologic culture were performed on samples of bulk-tank milk and cow-composite milk (n = 23,138 cows) from 50 California dairies, 19 of the 50 with known mastitis problems. Thirty-eight (76.0%) bulk-tank milk samples and 12,334 (53.3%) cows were positive by results of the CMT. Potential mastitis agents were isolated from 5,085 (22%) cows. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from all 50 herds, Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from 47 herds, and Mycoplasma sp was isolated from 24 herds. For cow-composite milk samples, the prevalences were 9.3% for Str agalactiae, 9.1% for S aureus, 0.9% for Mycoplasma sp, 1.2% for coliform bacteria, 0.9% for other streptococci, 0.8% for coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 1.3% for other organisms. The relative sensitivity and the relative specificity of the CMT performed on cow-composite milk samples were 83.4% and 55.2%, respectively, and the predictive value of positive CMT results was 34.2%.
TI  - [Studies of ceftizoxime in perinatal period].
AB  - Bacteriological studies and clinical evaluations of ceftizoxime (CZX) in perinatal period were carried out, and results are summarised as follows: Antibacterial activities of CZX in amniotic fluid were determined using the broth dilution method, and bactericidal effect on Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were demonstrated. The bactericidal effect of CZX increased in amniotic fluid and remarkable increases of activities against resistant strains were demonstrated. The penetration of CZX into mother's milk was low, and it was speculated that the drug transfer to the newborn through breast feeding was very little. Clinically, CZX was effective in the treatment of perinatal infections without any side effect. The above results has demonstrated that CZX is a clinically useful antibiotic for the prophylaxis and the treatment of perinatal infections.
TI  - Complete amino acid sequence of protein B.
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of protein B (= CAMP factor) of Streptococcus agalactiae has been determined. The sequence data were obtained mainly by manual sequencing of peptides derived from digestion with lysyl-peptidase, clostripain and Staphylococcus aureus protease and by solid phase sequencing of cyanogen bromide fragments. The protein contains 226 amino acids and has an Mr of 25,263. The sequence was compared with sequences of other Fc-binding proteins and partial sequence homology was found between protein B and the Fc-binding region of protein A.
TI  - Production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - Phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive properties of bovine neutrophils for mammary pathogens.
AB  - A comparative evaluation of in vitro phagocytic and metabolic activities of freshly isolated bovine blood neutrophils from 26 cows was performed. Degrees of phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by neutrophils were measured using zymosan, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Salmonella sp., and Brucella abortus opsonized with fresh bovine serum. Percent phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by the neutrophils were determined by microscopic evaluation of stained coverslip smears. Individual variation among cows was found in parameters measured, but age was not a contributing factor. Phagocytosis was high (73 to 81%) for E. coli, Salmonella sp., Strep. agalactiae, and zymosan; intermediate (64%) for Staph. aureus; and low (24 to 40%) for M. bovis and B. abortus. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was distinctly lower than zymosan (74%) for all microorganisms. Similar percentages (32 to 41%) of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were observed for E. coli, Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and M. bovis; intermediate (28%) was obtained for Salmonella sp. and lowest (11%) for B. abortus.
TI  - Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal osteomyelitis of the heel. A case report.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently reported, though not the only, causative organism in children who have osteomyelitis. In an 11-year-old child with osteomyelitis of the calcaneus, the etiologic agent was identified as a Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal organism. This organism seems not to have been previously reported as the cause of osteomyelitis in the heel.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Of the recent isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to RKM than to josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), erythromycin and lincomycin. Also, macrolides (MLs)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to RKM. 2. Recent isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, group G Streptococci, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to RKM than to midecamycin acetate and JM. Oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. T1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first 6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. Fifty-two patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Campylobacter enteritis, etc. were treated with RKM at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. An eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. A side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.
TI  - [Demonstration of an inoculum effect on the estimation of the minimal inhibitory  concentration of LY 146032].
AB  - This work has been performed to study the inoculum effect on the in vitro activity of LY 146032, a new lipopeptide antibiotic. A statistical analysis (X2 and t test) of the data concerning the MIC of different bacterial groups has been carried out to appreciate the phenomenon. The activity of vancomycin has been compared. A major inoculum effect has been detected for LY 146032. It must be taken into account to evaluate the activity of this new antibiotic.
TI  - Specificity of the anti-inflammatory effect of a staphylococcal cell wall extract in the bovine udder.
AB  - The cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus (strains 21 and Glaxo) was treated with deoxycholate and the insoluble residue was solubilised with lysozyme. The effect of the extract in modulating the inflammatory response due to infection of the lactating bovine udder was evaluated. Cows were infected with S. aureus strain 21 or Streptococcus agalactiae, with or without the cell wall extracts. The clinical response to infection was assessed, and milk samples collected up to 30 h were assayed for antitrypsin and NAGase levels, somatic cell count, and for the ability of whey to support bacterial growth. The extracts markedly reduced the inflammatory response elicited by both S. aureus and S. agalactiae, indicating the effect was non-specific. The extract from strain 21 was generally more effective than that from strain Glaxo.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid Mastitis Test for identification of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from bovine mammary glands.
AB  - A latex agglutination test system (Rapid Mastitis Test [RMT]; Immucell, Portland, Maine) containing reagents for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae from bovine intramammary infections was evaluated with 527 staphylococcal and 267 streptococcal isolates. The RMT Staphylococcus aureus reagent detected 94.2% of 242 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 80% of 25 Staphylococcus intermedius isolates, and 42.8% of 21 tube coagulase-positive Staphylococcus hyicus isolates. All Streptococcus agalactiae isolates were correctly identified by the RMT Streptococcus agalactiae reagent. Cross-reactions were observed with one Streptococcus dysgalactiae and three Streptococcus uberis strains. The RMT was found to be an acceptable method for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from bovine mammary glands. The occurrence of coagulase-positive staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus requires biochemical testing for species level identification.
TI  - Efficacy of teicoplanin as antimicrobial treatment of severe nosocomial infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a preliminary study.
AB  - We used single daily intravenous teicoplanin as therapy for 12 severe nosocomial  infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. A daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg was usually adopted; however, in selected cases the dosage was increased to 8-9.5 mg/day on the basis of serum bactericidal monitoring. Most of these infections were life-threatening and included ventriculitis/meningitis (3 cases), sepsis (3 cases), mediastinitis (1 case) and extensive burn wound infection (1 case). Staphylococcus aureus was by far the most frequent pathogen and methicillin-resistant strains were isolated in 7 out of 9 infections caused by this organism. The remaining isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, JK Corynebacterium, Streptococcus agalactiae and Propionilbacterium acnes. Additional antibiotics were used in 5 cases for concomitant gram-negative bacillus etiology (2 cases), granulocytopenia (2 cases), superinfection (1 case). Overall a clinical success and microbial eradication were documented in 100% and 91% of 12 cases, respectively. Except one case of fever, no other major adverse effect was observed and no patient required trial therapy discontinuation. In conclusion, our preliminary data seem to suggest a satisfactory activity of teicoplanin against nosocomial gram-positive infections.
TI  - Incidence and types of clinical mastitis in dairy herds with high and low somatic cell counts.
AB  - Eighteen dairy herds were studied, 12 with a 12-month Dairy Herd Improvement Association herd mean somatic cell count (SCC) less than or equal to 150,000 cells/ml (low SCC) and 6 with a 12-month mean SCC greater than 700,000 cells/ml (high SCC). At the outset of the study, quarter samples for bacteriologic culture were collected (in duplicate) from all quarters of all lactating cows (whole herd culture). Subsequently, quarter milk samples for culture from all cows with clinical mastitis were collected for a period of 6 months. In the herds with low SCC, results of whole herd culture revealed low prevalence of intramammary infection attributable to all major pathogens (less than 4% of all quarters). Prevalence of infection with Streptococcus agalactiae (22.2% of all quarters) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.6% of all quarters) was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in the herds with high SCC. Mean incidence of clinical mastitis in the herds with low SCC was 4.23 infections/100 cows/month (range, 0.42 to 10.25 infections). In the herds with high SCC, mean incidence was 2.91 infections/100 cows/month (range, 1.33 to 3.92 infections). In the herds with low SCC, infection type, as mean percentage of total clinically infected quarters sampled for culture/herd, was 0.0%, 2.2%, 12.3%, 43.5%, and 28.6% for Str agalactiae, S aureus, streptococci other than Str agalactiae, coliforms, and organisms not isolated, respectively. Respective percentages for the herds with high SCC were 41.5%, 18.3%, 12.6%, 8.0%, and 8.8%. During the study period (from April through January), incidence of clinical mastitis and clinical mastitis caused by coliform bacteria were highest in July and August for herds with low SCC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of duplicate and single quarter milk samples for the identification of intramammary infections.
AB  - Results of bacteriological culture of 5426 pairs of duplicate quarter milk samples collected were analyzed for agreement. Overall, the percentage of agreeing pairs was 98.1%. The percentage agreement by infection type was greater for the contagious pathogens, Streptococcus agalactiae (96.4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (94.2%), than for other Streptococcus spp. (81.6%) and coliform organisms (55.6%). Single quarter samples may be adequate for determining status of quarter infection with Strep. agalactiae and Staph. aureus.
TI  - Effect of naturally occurring intramammary infections by minor pathogens on new infections by major pathogens in cattle.
AB  - New mammary infections were recorded in 3 dairy herds during a lactation period by bacteriologic examination of milk samples at 3-week intervals. Influences of the infection status of quarters at the time of new infection and of microorganisms responsible for bacterial invasion were analyzed. The new infection rate in uninfected quarters was about 3 times the rate in quarters already harboring bacterial considered minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis) or major pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci). The frequency of new infections with major pathogens was almost halved by preexisting infections with minor pathogens (P = 0.05), mainly because of coagulase-negative staphylococci (P = 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, C bovis (P = 0.19). New infections by minor pathogens also were less frequent in quarters harboring a major pathogen (P less than 0.05), indicating that the competition or antagonism between mammary infections was a general phenomenon.
TI  - Two genes for chloramphenicol resistance common to staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - Southern blot hybridization and pneumococcal transformation were used to study the epidemiology at a molecular level of the genes for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) in streptococci and staphylococci. The cat gene of staphylococcal plasmid pC194 showed homology to the cat genes of the chromosomal elements of 5 different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and of Streptococcus agalactiae B109. DNA sequence homology was also detected between the cat gene of staphylococcal plasmid pC221 and the cat gene of broad host range conjugative plasmid pIP501, originally isolated from S. agalactiae. Two different cat genes appear to be present in clinical isolates of both streptococci and staphylococci.
TI  - Effects of source and washing of erythrocytes on growth of bacterial pathogens from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Effects of source and washing of RBC on quantitative growth and hemolytic zone sizes of common bacterial pathogens of the bovine mammary gland were evaluated. Blood samples used to prepare the blood agar media were obtained from 10 adult dairy cows, 10 dairy calves, and 10 sheep. Hemolytic zone sizes produced by Staphylococcus aureus were significantly (P less than 0.01) larger on blood agar prepared with washed RBC than on blood agar prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. With the exception of Corynebacterium bovis, growth of all bacteria was equivalent or significantly higher on medium prepared with washed RBC, compared with that on medium prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. Significantly higher numbers of C bovis (P less than 0.01) and Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than 0.01) were isolated on medium prepared with washed cow RBC. Significantly higher numbers of Str uberis (P less than 0.01) and S aureus (P less than 0.05) were isolated on medium prepared with washed sheep RBC and washed calf RBC, respectively. Growth of Escherichia coli was not affected by the RBC source. Seemingly, RBC used in the preparation of medium should be washed. The source of RBC, as well as inter-animal variation, also should be considered in the quality control of medium.

TI  - Determination of teat dip germicidal activity using the excised teat model.
AB  - Fifteen postmilking teat antiseptics were evaluated in seven trials using the excised teat model. All products were tested against Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305 and Streptococcus agalactiae Cornell 48. Eight of nine iodophor products provided log reductions greater than 3 against Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae. A .045% iodophor product was ineffective. A .5% chlorhexidine product yielded a log reduction of 3.22 against Staph. aureus but only 2.92 against Strep. agalactiae. Two products containing fermented milk emulsified in detergent were tested upon receipt and after 1 yr storage. Fresh product provided log reductions greater than 3 against both pathogens. Storage for 1 yr resulted in minimal loss of germicidal activity. Three products containing 1, .5, and .2% dodecylaminoalkyl glycine provided log reductions greater than 3.5 against Staph. aureus and greater than 4 log reduction against Strep. agalactiae.
TI  - Lung antibacterial defense mechanisms in infant and adult rats: implications for  the pathogenesis of group B streptococcal infections in the neonatal lung.
AB  - We investigated factors that may contribute to lung infections in infants by studying the intrapulmonary responses to aerosols of three different types of organisms--group B streptococcus with and without type-specific capsule, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus--in infant (12-h-old or 24-36-h-old) and adult (150 g, 6-w-old) rats. After aerosol exposure, the lung clearance rate of each organism varied inversely with the age of the animals, and the magnitude of the clearance defect was related more strongly to animal age than to the bacterial species. Fewer alveolar macrophages from infant animals phagocytosed each type of organism in vivo, and the rate of neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of infant animals was delayed. The neonatal lung functioned effectively, however, as an antibacterial barrier, as newborn animals survived an aerosolized inoculum that exceeded the LD50 by the subcutaneous route.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriologic studies of the frequency of mastitis during and after parturition in heifers lactating for the first time].
AB  - The udders of 100 heifers were examined for clinical changes during parturition.  Of each quarter colostral samples were taken and analyzed bacteriologically. 35 heifers (13.5% of the quarters) showed clinical changes of the quarters and/or of colostral samples. 14 of these animals (4.75% of the quarters) suffered from cellulitis-like mastitis. 13 (5.25% of the quarters) had acute catarrhalic mastitis and eight heifers (3.5% of the quarters) showed acute galactophoritis. In all milk samples of animals with pathological changes of the udder or of colostrum the causing bacteria could be identified. Besides the group of 35 heifers with clinical lesions udder-pathogenic bacteria were found in samples of 24 apparently healthy animals (20.5% of the quarters) during parturition. However, these animals failed to show clinical signs of inflammation at least until the end of this study (10 days post partum). Isolated bacteria included facultative and obligate pathogenic species, 70% of which were gram-positive cocci (i.e. Streptococcus [Sc.] uberis, Sc. dysgalactiae, Sc. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci) versus 30% of gram-negative bacteria (i.e. Escherichia [E.] coli, Klebsiella and other coliform species. In-vitro-susceptibility tests showed best effectiveness of Penicillin against Sc., Cloxacillin against staphylococci and Gentamycin and Polymyxin B against coliform bacteria. Possible pathways, leading to bacterial infection of first lactating heifers during parturition, are discussed. Pathways of infection seem to be of lesser importance for the development of apparent, sometimes severe mastitis with coliform bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Teicoplanin in combination therapy for febrile episodes in neutropenic and non-neutropenic paediatric patients.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of teicoplanin in combination with other antimicrobial agents for therapy of severe suspected or proven Gram-positive infection in children and also to determine a dosage regimen for paediatric patients. Twenty children were given 23 courses of teicoplanin therapy for 11 septicaemias, one erysipelas, one cellulitis and 11 cases of fever of unknown origin. Eighteen of the 20 patients had severe underlying disease: one solid tumour, 15 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, two acute myeloblastic leukaemias; 15 were neutropenic; 19 had a central line. Thirteen Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the blood cultures in eleven patients. There were eight coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), (five methicillin-resistant) and four Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Teicoplanin was given as a 30 min infusion twice on the first day then once a day. The mean unit dose was 6 mg/kg for first eight patients. One clinical failure and lower serum concentrations than expected led us to increase the dosage to 10 mg/kg daily for the remaining patients. Tolerability remained excellent. It is concluded that antistaphylococcal treatment for febrile episodes in neutropenic patients can be satisfactorily provided by teicoplanin 10 mg/kg iv daily with a second loading dose on the first day. One injection a day is a convenient schedule in paediatrics.
TI  - Group B streptococcal soft tissue infections beyond the neonatal period.
AB  - In one year sporadic soft tissue infections due to group B streptococci were identified in 37 patients beyond the neonatal period. Serious underlying conditions were present in 25 patients (68%), including 17 (46%) who had diabetes mellitus and 4 (11%) with paraplegia. Unlike previous reports, 12 patients (32%) were previously healthy. Infection developed in 8 persons as a result of minor trauma. The mean age of the normal hosts was 20.9 years, whereas the mean age of patients with underlying disease was 44.2 years (P<.0005). The clinical spectrum was varied and included abscess formation in 17 patients (46%). All patients required treatment with antibiotics and 28 (76%) required admission to hospital. Complete recovery occurred in 33 patients (89%) while 4 with diabetes required amputation of infected extremities. Group B Streptococcus was the only organism identified in 22 patients (59%) while mixed organisms were cultured in 15 (41%), including Staphylococcus aureus in 12 and gram-negative enteropathogens in 4. Group B streptococcal soft tissue infections beyond the neonatal period are common and may even involve normal hosts.
TI  - Interaction of soluble fibronectin with group B streptococci.
AB  - Fibronectin binds to a variety of bacterial species, and we hypothesized that differential fibronectin binding might influence the invasive potential of group B streptococci (GBS). Human plasma fibronectin purified by a standard two-step chromatographic procedure was radiolabeled with 3H. Fifty GBS strains (invasive, colonizing, or bovine) representing serotypes Ia (10 strains), Ib (6 strains), Ia/c (6 strains), II (10 strains), III (11 strains), IV (1 strain), and nontypable (6 strains) were tested. No source or serotype variability was detected among GBS strains, and binding was uniformly less than 1.5% of available fibronectin. Lack of detectable binding occurred at both the log and stationary growth phases and persisted despite treatment with trypsin or neuraminidase or opsonization with immunoglobulin G containing high levels (greater than 40 micrograms/ml) of antibody specific for the Ia, II, or III GBS capsular polysaccharides. Incubation with GBS did not inhibit fibronectin binding to the Cowan 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Strain COH 31-15, an isogenic, type III, capsule-deficient mutant of COH 31r/s, also failed to bind fibronectin. In contrast to other streptococci, GBS do not have readily detectable receptors for soluble fibronectin as part of their surface structures. If present, binding sites for soluble fibronectin are deep to surface structures, obscured from host defense systems, or require the presence of other factors to facilitate their recognition of fibronectin. The uniform ability of GBS to resist binding to soluble fibronectin could be a significant virulence factor in the pathogenesis of invasive infections of infants.
TI  - [The study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to the upper respiratory tract of ferrets infected with influenza A virus.
AB  - A ferret model was used to study bacterial adherence in animals with influenza. Ferrets were inoculated intranasally with influenza A3/Hong Kong/1/68 virus. Antiviral serum antibodies were apparent by Day 5. On Days 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, three virus-inoculated and two uninoculated controls were anesthetized, exsanguinated, and decapitated, and the lower jaw was removed. Each animal was inoculated intranasally with a 1-ml suspension containing 20 mg (dry wt) of either 3H-labeled Staphylococcus aureus or 3H-labeled group B Streptococcus type Ia and incubated for 45 min at ambient temperature. In animals challenged with staphylococci, 80% of the original inoculum remained free in suspension; of the remaining 20%, the distribution in the upper respiratory tracts of virus-infected and control animals was significantly different. Of the staphylococci remaining in the nasopharynx of control animals, 74% was present in mucinous plugs, 11% was bound to host cells present in washes of the nasal cavity, and 15% was released by protease treatment of the nasopharynx. Of the staphylococci remaining in the upper respiratory tract of virus-infected ferrets, 36% was recovered in plugs, 24% was bound to cells in nasal washes, and 40% was released by enzyme treatment. Overall, adherence-positive staphylococci represented 64% of recoverable bacteria in virus-infected ferrets versus 26% in controls. Adherence was increased twofold (Days 5 and 7) to threefold (Days 3, 9, and 11) in virus-infected ferrets compared to uninfected controls. In contrast, only 7% of the original streptococcal inoculum was recovered from virus-infected and uninfected control animals and virus infection did not enhance streptococcal adherence except for an approximately threefold increase that was seen on Day 11.
TI  - Neonatal septicemia in Stockholm.
AB  - In a prospective study to determine the incidence and etiology of neonatal septicemia at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, all cases of neonatal septicemia in infants born at the hospital from 1981 to 1985 were reviewed. There were 4.0 cases of neonatal septicemia per 1,000 live births during the study period. During the five year period the incidence of septicemia tended to increase, mainly due to the increasing incidence of septicemia in infants with a birth weight below 1,500 grams. The single most common causative organism was group B streptococci with an incidence of 1.4 per 1,000 live births, Staphylococcus aureus accounting for 1.1 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis for 0.7 cases, and gram-negative rods for only 0.4 cases per 1,000 live births. In a retrospective study of the incidence of neonatal septicemia in a non-selected patient population, all cases in the Stockholm area in 1983 were reviewed. In that year there were 17,586 live births in the area and the incidence of neonatal septicemia was 2.6 per 1,000 live births. Group B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative rods were equally common as causative agents.
TI  - Growth responses of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae to Corynebacterium bovis metabolites.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae growth responses to metabolites of Corynebacterium bovis cultured in media containing polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, monooleate, or trioleate and milk were determined. Filter sterilized metabolites of 48-h C. bovis cultures in synthetic media were added to cultures of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae. Staphylococcus aureus and Strep. agalactiae were inoculated into 12-h C. bovis milk cultures. Growth responses of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were not affected by C. bovis metabolites of synthetic media. Staphylococcus aureus growth was inhibited during logarithmic and stationary phases in milk containing mixed cultures of C. bovis compared with growth in pure Staph. aureus cultures. Streptococcus agalactiae growth curves were similar in pure and C. bovis mixed cultures. Fatty acid compositions were not different in sterile milk and milk containing bacterial cultures. Growth responses of Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae were not related to concentration of C. bovis metabolites or fatty acid content of media in which C. bovis were cultured.
TI  - Blood selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activities in dairy herds with high and low somatic cell counts.
AB  - Two groups of dairy herds (16 herds/group) were studied to determine the relationship between the prevalence of mastitis in a herd and mean herd blood concentrations of vitamins A and E, beta-carotene, and selenium (Se). One group had a Dairy Herd Improvement Association 12-month mean herd somatic cell count (SCC) of less than or equal to 150,000 cells/ml. The second group had a Dairy Herd Improvement Association 12-month mean herd SCC of greater than or equal to 700,000 cells/ml. Once for each herd, duplicate milk samples were collected from each quarter of the lactating cows, and blood samples were collected from 21 cows in various stages of lactation. Serum concentrations of vitamin A, beta-carotene, and vitamin E and whole blood concentrations of Se and Se-dependent glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined. Significant differences between the 2 groups were not found with respect to serum concentrations of vitamin A, vitamin E, or beta-carotene. However, the herds with the low SCC (less than or equal to 150,000 cells/ml) had significantly higher mean (+/- SEM) blood GSH-Px activity (35.6 +/- 2.95 mU/mg of hemoglobin) than did the herds with the high SCC (20.2 +/- 2.38 mU/mg of Hb). Whole blood concentrations of Se also were significantly higher in the herds with low SCC (0.133 +/- 0.010 microgram/ml of blood) than in the herds with high SCC (0.074 +/- 0.007 microgram/ml of blood). Significant negative correlations were found between the prevalence of intramammary infection with major pathogens and mean herd activity of GSH-Px (r = -0.62) and mean herd concentrations of Se (r = -0.66).
TI  - Herd management and prevalence of mastitis in dairy herds with high and low somatic cell counts.
AB  - Thirty-two dairy herds, 16 with low somatic cell counts (LSCC; Dairy Herd Improvement Association 12-month mean herd SCC less than or equal to 150,000 cells/ml) and 16 with high somatic cell counts (HSCC; Dairy Herd Improvement Association 12-month mean herd SCC greater than or equal to 700,000 cells/ml) were evaluated to determine the relationship between the prevalence of mastitis in each herd and each herd's mastitis control and management practices. Once for each herd, duplicate quarter milk samples were collected from the lactating cows, a survey of herd mastitis control, milking hygiene, and management practices of each herd was performed, and milking-machine function was evaluated. Of the 16 herds with LSCC, 2 (12.5%) had Streptococcus agalactiae isolated and 7 (44%) had Staphylococcus aureus isolated. Both organisms were found in all of the herds with HSCC. In herds with LSCC, the mean percentage of quarters infected with Str agalactiae was 0.1%, the mean percentage infected with streptococci other than Str agalactiae was 1.9%, and the mean infected with S aureus was 0.7%. In herds with HSCC, 25.7% of the quarters were infected with Str agalactiae, 3.7% were infected with streptococci other than Str agalactiae, and 7.6% were infected with S aureus. A program of postmilking teat dipping and treatment of all cows at the beginning of the nonlactating period was practiced more frequently in the herds with LSCC (81.3%) than in the herds with HSCC (37.5%). Major differences were not found between the 2 groups of herds in the use of the more common milking hygiene techniques or in the maintenance and functional characteristics of the milking equipment.
TI  - Growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. Antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. Polyene C18:2 and C18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. The most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were C12 and C14. Streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. No incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. Polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on C. bovis. Corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. A relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide, compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against selected gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 was determined and compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against a limited spectrum of 401 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. A-56268 was quite active against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci and was moderately active against Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. A-56268 was consistently bactericidal only for S. pneumoniae. The activity of A-56268 was comparable to that of erythromycin against most organisms tested.
TI  - [Drug resistance of bacterial strains isolated from sows with the clinical picture of mastitis-metritis-agalactia].
AB  - The disk method with Ericson and Bauer's solid nutrient media were employed to ascertain the drug resistance of a total of 54 strains of Escherichia coli, 25 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 11 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 7 strains of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 7 strains of Streptococcus uberis, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 1 strain of Streptococcus disgalactiae isolated from utero-cervical exudate and milk samples of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA). It was found that gentamycin only suppressed 100 per cent of the strains. So far as the other chemotherapeutic agents were concerned the organisms showed a varying extent of resistance. After determining the sensitivity of the strains to drugs two groups of pigs (from which the strains referred to were isolated) were subject to treatment. All 20 sows of the first group were treated with oxytocin only, while the 446 animals of the second group were treated with gentamycin in combination with oxytocin. It was found that effective therapy in the case of MMA was impossible with the application of preparations on the base of the hind lobe of the pituitary only. It is necessary to use chemotherapeutic means tow which the isolated organisms are susceptible.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CI934, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with coumermycin, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cl934, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, was studied  against 314 strains of Gram-positive bacteria representing 6 genera: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. milleri, viridans streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Bacillus spp.; and compared with that of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ampicillin, coumermycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifapentine, LM 427, erythromycin, minocycline, tetracycline and clindamycin. The agar dilution method was used. Cl934 was very active in vitro, with MIC90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l against most species tested, except for S. faecalis and M. fortuitum. It was usually 2 to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. Cl934 was also tested by the killing curve method, alone and in combination with coumermycin. It was rapidly bactericidal against most species tested, including S. faecalis. A synergistic interaction was observed with coumermycin against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. milleri and S. faecalis. The only antagonistic interaction occurred against L. monocytogenes exposed to 8 X MIC of Cl934 with 2 X MIC of coumermycin.
TI  - Microbiology of the genitalia of nulliparous and postpartum Savanna brown goats.
AB  - A study of the bacterial flora of the genitalia of nulliparous Savanna Brown does was carried out both before breeding and at different intervals postpartum to investigate the type of microbial organisms that could be present in the uterus, cervix and the vagina respectively. Of 29 pre-breeding vaginal swabs, Staphylococcus sp. was isolated from 20 goats, Streptococcus sp. from 15 goats and Micrococcus sp. from four goats. Mycoplasma agalactiae was isolated from five goats. The postpartum vagina did not show any appreciable change in the microbial flora, except that Escherichia coli was encountered in two cases. The uterus yielded E. coli from the goats slaughtered 2 days postpartum; Micrococcus sp. from goats slaughtered 12 days postpartum; Staph. aureus from goats slaughtered 16 days postpartum and Staph. aureus from goats slaughtered 24 days postpartum. Also in these two cases-a goat slaughtered at two days postpartum (dpp) and a goat slaughtered 16 dpp-E. coli was present in the uterus. Other isolates from the uteri of slaughtered goats were Micrococcus sp. (12 dpp), Staph. aureus and Micrococcus sp. (16 dpp) and Staph. aureus (24 dpp).
TI  - The effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis, while Ps. aeruginosa, Str. faecalis and Str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. But when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. The levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. When lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on B. subtilis was restored. The growth of Staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Group B streptococcal bacteremia in men.
AB  - Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia due to group B Streptococcus (GBS) in men were reviewed for both clinical and microbiologic features. The commonest sources of bacteremia were infections of the respiratory tract (seven cases), skin (five cases), urinary tract (four cases), and intravenous access sites (four cases). Sixteen (70%) of the cases of bacteremia were hospital acquired, and 10 (43%) were polymicrobial (seven with Staphylococcus aureus). GBS bacteremia was generally low-grade and brief as assessed by the percentage and persistence of positive blood cultures. Among patients bacteremic with GBS alone, there were no instances of shock or metastatic suppuration and only one death as a direct result of sepsis. Overall however, nine other patients died of their underlying disease during the same hospitalization. GBS bacteremia in men is, in itself, generally a moderate infection, but it is often found as part of more complex sepsis in hospitalized patients with serious, often fatal, predisposing illnesses.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies of cefotiam in neonates and premature infants].
AB  - The effect of cefotiam (CTM) on neonates and premature infants was examined in basic and clinical studies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CTM against 190 clinically isolated strains kept by this department were investigated. This drug was found to have a strong antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, although some strains were resistant. The CTM was given to 0-3, 4-7, and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and we studied changes in serum CTM levels over time. Mean serum CTM levels were 62.3 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 16.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after the injection, with the half-life of 3.6 hours, for the 0-3 day-old premature infants. They were 38.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 10.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 2.9 hours, for the 0-3 day-old neonates. Those levels were 22.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.9 hours, for the 4-7 day-old neonates, and 51.8 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 1.0 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.1 hours, for the greater than or equal to 8 day-old neonates. The CTM was given to 0-3 and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and changes in serum CTM levels after the infusion were followed. The 0-3 day-old premature infant (there was only one subject) had a peak serum CTM level of 21.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after the start of the infusion (that is, at the time of its completion), with the level decreased to 8.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours and the half-life was 5.4 hours. The mean peak serum CTM level in 0-3 day-old neonates were 36.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, which decreased to a mean of 7.0 micrograms/ml at 7 hours; the half-life was 2.3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Rapid method for the detection of group B streptococci from human sources.
AB  - A modification of the classical CAMP test has been devised for the rapid detection of streptococci of serological Group B from human sources. The method was compared with detection based on the development of orange pigmented colonies on a starch-based medium and with detection by conventional methods. In a survey of vaginal carriage of Group B streptococci in parturient women, the modified CAMP test detected a carriage rate of 13.09%, the starch-based, pigment enhancing medium, 5.76% and the conventional methods, 8.38%. It proved to be particularly useful for detecting the organisms in the presence of other bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid inoculum standardization system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - A commercially available rapid inoculum standardization system (RISS) was compared to the broth inoculum standardization method (BIS) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates from the bovine mammary gland. Overall agreement between RISS and the BIS method was 95.9%. RISS bypasses the 2-8 h incubation period required by BIS, thus providing antimicrobial susceptibility test data in a more timely manner. RISS was determined to be an acceptable alternative method to the BIS method for preparation of standardized inoculum for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bovine mammary gland isolates.
TI  - Relationship between mastitis pathogen numbers in bulk tank milk and bovine udder infections in California dairy herds.
AB  - Samples of bulk tank milk and cow-composite milk from 23,138 dairy cows from 50 California dairies were examined by use of microbiologic procedures. The number of colonies of mastitis pathogens isolated per milliliter of bulk tank milk (used as a predictor of the percentage of infected cows in the herd) was evaluated, using simple regression analysis and Spearman's rank correlation. Correlations between the pathogens and the percentage of cows in each herd shedding the pathogens were found for Streptococcus agalactiae (r = 0.71) and mycoplasma (r = 0.59), but were considerably lower for other pathogens. When greater than or equal to 4,000 colonies of Streptococcus agalactiae were found per milliliter of bulk tank milk, at least 7% of the cows in the herd was shedding this organism. However, a pattern was not found between the number of mycoplasma colonies per milliliter of bulk tank milk and the percentage of infected cows in the herd.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive mastogenic bacteria in normal, simulated bulk tank, and mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank.
AB  - Growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus uberis was studied in normal milk, simulated bulk tank milk, and aseptic mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank for 48 h. With the exception of S. bovis, growth rates of the other five bacteria were similar in both normal and simulated bulk tank milk. Mastitic milk inhibited growth of all bacteria studied. A 24-h adjustment period occurred before most of the bacteria started growing. The mastitis level in a dairy herd may be monitored by cultures of bulk tank milk samples and by calculations as discussed in this study.
TI  - [Antibacterial action of shanxiangyuan produced by different technology products].
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of .5% and 1% iodophor teat dips on commercial dairies.
AB  - Two postmilking teat dips containing .5 and 1% iodine were evaluated for approximately 8 mo under conditions of natural exposure to mastitis pathogens on four commercial dairy farms. In the two herds using .5% iodophor, incidence of intramammary infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was reduced 68.3 and 46.2%, respectively. When numbers of new infections with both pathogens were combined, efficacy for the .5% iodophor was 62.3%. In the two herds using 1% iodophor, incidence of intramammary infection with Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae was reduced 52.4 and 70.7%, respectively. When numbers of new infections with both pathogens were combined, efficacy for the 1% iodophor was 64.3%. Efficacy of teat dips was variable against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Corynebacterium bovis.
TI  - Coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin G and vancomycin. A total of 251 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by an agar dilution method. Clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. All the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. Netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus. The MICs of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin G and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. Coumermycin showed poor activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and enterococci. Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates had also high MICs, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic milk and whey.
AB  
TI  - Bacteriostatic activity of bovine milk lactoferrin against mastitic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteriostatic activity of bovine lactoferrin (Lf) against mastitic bacteria  was assessed with an in vitro microassay. The most susceptible species was Escherichia coli; all of the 35 isolates tested were susceptible to bacteriostasis by apo-Lf (0.1 mg ml-1), although a few strains showed a lower degree of inhibition. Heterogeneity among strains was more pronounced among 10 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, four of which were apparently unaffected by apo-Lf (1 mg ml-1). Under the same conditions, Streptococcus agalactiae (six isolates) and Str. uberis (five isolates) resisted the bacteriostatic action of apo-Lf.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? A microbiological study.
AB  - In 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. Before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including Chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The Gram-positive aerobic cocci, Staph. epidermidis, Strept. faecalis and Strept. agalactiae as well as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. These microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. Staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. These three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. On the other hand, Strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. Since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.
TI  - Efficacy of dodecylaminoalkyl glycine teat dip against Staphylococcus aureus and  Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis.
AB  - Dodecylaminoalkyl glycine teat dip, diluted to 1.5% active ingredients, was evaluated in a controlled experimental challenge study to determine efficacy for preventing new intramammary infections with Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould 305) and Streptococcus agalactiae (McDonald 44). The dip reduced the incidence of intramammary infection with Staphylococcus aureus by 81.2%. Reduction of Streptococcus agalactiae intramammary infection was 67.5%.
TI  - Microbial pathogens from goat mastitis and phage-typing of Staphylococcus aureus  isolates.
AB  - Examination of milk from goats yielded 41 strains from 40 clinically affected halves; 15 were Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Staph. epidermis, 1 Streptococcus agalactiae, 2 Strept. dysgalactiae, 5 Strept. uberis, 2 Corynebacterium pyogenes, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Pasteurella spp. and 4 Mycoplasma spp. One half had dual infection of Staph. aureus and Strept. dysgalactiae. Twenty two of the 297 milk samples from apparently normal halves also harboured pathogens comprising of 9 Staph. aureus, 1 Strept. agalactiae, 2 E. coli, 2 Pasteurella spp., 2 Candida albicans and 6 Mycoplasma spp. Most of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to many broad spectrum antibiotics. Twenty of the 24 Staph. aureus isolates were phase typable by a set of 23 human Staphylococcal International Phages suggesting the utility of these phages for the typing of goat strains. The isolates were grouped into 15 phage-types, many of which have been reported from human infections in Iraq. This indicates the possibility of association of human strains of Staph. aureus in caprine mastitis. No definite correlation could be noted between antibiogram and phage types of Staph. aureus strains.
TI  - Blocking of antibody complement-dependent effector functions by streptococcal IgG Fc-receptor and staphylococcal protein A.
AB  - Using haemolysis in gel, two bacterial IgG-binding substances, an Fc-receptor isolated from group A streptococci type M15, and protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, were shown to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit IgG. When the crude alkaline extracts of ten types of group A streptococci were tested to see whether streptococcal components other than Fc-binding material might affect lysis, the degree of inhibition was found to be correlated with Fc-binding activity. In no case was the lysis of IgM-coated cells inhibited. Opsonophagocytosis experiments showed that both purified streptococcal Fc-receptor and protein A impaired antibody complement-dependent killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of each of two strains of group B streptococci (lacking IgG Fc-receptors). Furthermore, the impairment was ascribable to interference with the fixation of complement to the antibodies, as demonstrated in pre-opsonization experiments with one of the strains. Our results suggest that blocking of the binding of complement to IgG is an important virulence mechanism in Fc-receptor-bearing streptococci and staphylococci.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of antibiotic dry cow teat canal and intramammary dry cow therapy of dairy cows on the prevalence of teat canal and intramammary infections at calving.
AB  - The specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg/0.25 ml and 14 mg/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. Of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. By treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. Untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. Cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - In vitro growth inhibition of mastitis causing bacteria by phenolics and metal chelators.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of three phenolic compounds and four metal chelators were tested at 0, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm in vitro against four major mastitis-causing bacteria, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Overall, butylated hydroxyanisole and tert-butylhydroquinone showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. These phenolics were bactericidal at 250 to 500 ppm against all four bacteria tested. The butylated hydroxytoluene was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but was ineffective against the coliforms. At 250 ppm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but much less effective against the gram-negatives. However, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was more growth inhibitory than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid against the gram-negative bacteria and especially against Escherichia coli. All other compounds were generally much less effective or ineffective against all four microorganisms. Therefore, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid may have practical implications in the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Group B streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis arising from an episiotomy.
AB  - A case of extensive necrotizing fasciitis arising from an episiotomy is presented. Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. Prompt recognition and aggressive therapy resulted in a favorable outcome despite significant morbidity. Salient clinical features of this rare postpartum complication are discussed and previous cases are reviewed. In addition to wide surgical resection, therapy included aggressive volume resuscitation with Swan-Ganz catheter monitoring, the use of military antishock trousers (MAST suit) to control diffuse hemorrhage, and temporary application of porcine xenografts.
TI  - Effects of Corynebacterium bovis infection on susceptibility to major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of Corynebacterium bovis. Challenge procedures using Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould 305) and Streptococcus agalactiae (McDonald 44) were used to study effects of Corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. Rate of infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with Corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. Principal location of Corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. Quarters with Corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by Staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. Quarters infected with Corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to Streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. Somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed Corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 X 10(5).
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Evaluation of Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser for detecting significant bacteriuria.
AB  - In a pilot study a prototype Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser was used to study the growth of six commonly encountered urinary pathogens in a range of five different laboratory media. No single medium had been able to show acceptable conductance changes for all bacteria within five hours. Subsequently, the Malthus system, with fastidious anaerobe broth as the culture medium, was used to screen 500 consecutive clinical specimens of urine for significant bacteriuria. After two and a half hours the Malthus system detected 32 out of the 40 true positives and eight of the 44 contaminated urines. Increasing the detection time to five hours permitted the recognition of 39 true positives and 37 contaminated urines.
TI  - Evaluation of the Spot-CAMP test for the rapid presumptive identification of group B streptococci.
AB  - A rapid Spot-CAMP test was evaluated for its ability to accurately identify colonies of Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield Group B) growing on primary sheep blood agar plates. The test uses a beta-lysin-containing filtrate, which is prepared from a broth culture of Staphylococcus aureus. A drop of beta-lysin filtrate is applied adjacent to a suspected group B Streptococcus (GBS) colony and the plate is incubated and then examined for a zone of synergistic hemolysis. The Spot-CAMP test demonstrated 100% correlation with both a Standard CAMP procedure and Lancefield serogrouping. The rapid Spot-CAMP test was easy to perform and inexpensive, and could presumptively identify within 30 minutes colonies of GBS growing on primary isolation plates.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of group B streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus to killing by oxygen metabolites.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) lack catalase, and they produce and release H2O2;thus, they should be readily killed by phagocytes with a diminished respiratory burst. Surprisingly, although strains of Staphylococcus aureus were killed at H2O2 concentrations greater than 0.5 mM, GBS strains were killed only at concentrations greater than 5mM. In contrast, GBS were killed by hydroxyl radicals generated by the xanthine oxidase-acetaldehyde system at O2 fluxes greater than or equal to 3.5 nmol/ml per min, whereas O2 fluxes greater than or equal to 10 nmol/ml per min were required to kill the S. aureus strains. Results with virulent and laboratory strains of GBS were similar. The differences in susceptibility of GBS and S. aureus seemed to correlate with differences in content of endogenous oxygen-metabolite scavengers. GBS contained approximately 100-fold more glutathione and approximately 20-fold more glutathione reductase than did S. aureus, whereas S. aureus was rich in catalase that GBS lacked. GBS that were grown in buthionine sulfoximine, however, contained 87% less glutathione than did controls but were not more susceptible to killing by H2O2 or the xanthine oxidase-acetaldehyde system. Similarly, the relative susceptibility of GBS to tert-butyl hydroperoxide and H2O2 paralleled that of S. aureus. Thus, inherent differences in susceptibility of vital cellular functions to oxidative damage rather than content of oxygen-metabolite scavengers may account for the differences in susceptibility of GBS and S. aureus.
TI  - Field studies on linear dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid teat dip.
AB  - A teat dip containing 1.94% linear dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and 12% glycerine, an anionic detergent formulation, was evaluated in two field trials on a commercial dairy. In Trial 1, the teat dip was compared to an undipped control in a split-herd design. Incidence of infection with Streptococcus agalactiae was reduced 57.8%; infections with presumptively identified Staphylococcus aureus were not reduced. Milking machine function and milking procedures may have affected teat dip effectiveness and incidence of udder infection. Streptococcus agalactiae was eradicated prior to Trial 2 in which the detergent teat dip was compared to a 1% iodophor product of proven efficacy. Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus infection was 40.5% lower in the detergent than in the iodophor group. Taxonomic studies on Staphylococcus species indicated that presumptive microbial identification resulted in erroneous conclusions concerning efficacy of the teat dip products. Importance of speciation of staphylococcal isolates is discussed.
TI  - Duration of bovine intramammary infections in commercial dairy herds.
AB  - Data on the infection status of cows on seven commercial dairy farms were collected over 492 full lactations. Foremilk samples were taken at an average interval of five weeks. A total of 249 streptococcal and 433 staphylococcal infections were diagnosed. Spontaneous elimination occurred in 49 per cent of all streptococcal infections and in 54 per cent of Staphylococcus aureus infections. The average duration of spontaneously eliminated infections was 10.8 weeks for Streptococcus agalactiae, 9.9 weeks for Strep dysgalactiae, 10.4 weeks for Strep uberis and 12.8 weeks for Staph aureus. The average duration of infections persisting until drying off was 19.3 weeks for Strep agalactiae, 18.7 weeks for Strep dysgalactiae, 18.5 weeks for Strep uberis and 25.2 weeks for Staph aureus. The method and rate of elimination of infection as found in this analysis are of value for estimating new infection rates and selecting quarters for dry cow therapy.
TI  - Current diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  - An analysis was made of 91 cases of infective endocarditis (IE) with regard to causative organisms and their sensitivities to various antibiotics, the clinical features of the disease, the laboratory test results and other items were important in establishing a diagnosis of IE. The number of cases of IE has shown a tendency to increase in recent years, particularly in the number of elderly patients, and the ratio of total cases consisting of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) has shown a sharp increase. The most common causative organism is still Streptococcus viridans, but there has been an increase in the incidence of IE due to benzyl-penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and other fastidious organisms. The percentage of underlying diseases represented by combined valvular diseases has been increasing, while the primary known cause of the infection of IE was dental treatments. A positive value for CRP, an accelerated value for ESR, leukocytosis, anemia, a decrease in serum Fe, a positive value for RA-T, were all parameters which showed a high correlation with IE, and these should be useful in establishing the diagnosis of IE. The use of cardioechography to detect cardiac vegetation is important in relation to establishing the diagnosis and prognosis of IE, and the evaluation of the therapeutic results.
TI  - Opsonic activity of cord blood sera against various species of microorganism.
AB  - The results of the present study on the opsonic activity of cord blood serum against various microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and group B streptococci) show that the activity of cord blood serum in promoting IgG-mediated ingestion is equal to that of sera of healthy adults. This implies that IgG concentrations, as assessed by immunochemical methods, in cord blood and adult sera represent functionally similar IgG activities. Ingestion of microorganisms involving complement-dependent opsonization was found to be of the same level for cord blood and adult sera, when the opsonization occurred via the classical pathway of complement activation. However, due to decreased concentrations of factors B, P, and D in cord blood serum, optimal opsonization of microorganisms requiring the alternative pathway of complement was impaired. Taken together, these results indicate that an opsonic defect of cord blood serum affects mainly microorganisms requiring opsonization via the alternative pathway of complement.
TI  - Immunogenic properties of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae administered separately and in combination to lactating cows.
AB  - Composite bacterins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, or either bacterin alone, were administered systemically to groups of lactating cows. The response to each bacterin was unaffected by the simultaneous administration of the antigens when assessed by comparing the antibody levels in milk by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was no evidence of cross reactivity of the antigens studied, nor immunopotentiation by either bacteria.
TI  - Group B streptococcal cellulitis in an adult.
AB  - A 75-year-old man with stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia was seen for tingling in the left arm, vesicular rash confined to the dorsum of the left hand, and diffuse erythema and swelling that extended to the elbow. Gram's stain of material aspirated from the cellulitic area revealed gram-positive cocci. Blood cultures grew group B streptococci, and cultures of material from the cellulitic area grew group B streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis with bacteremia was diagnosed, and seven-day drug therapy with acyclovir (Zovirax) and penicillin G was started. The cellulitis resolved and the vesicular lesions crusted over within seven days. Group B streptococci, traditionally regarded as pathogens of neonates, are becoming an increasingly important cause of infection in adults. Primary care physicians who care for adults, especially those who are elderly, should include group B streptococci in the differential diagnosis of cellulitis.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefminox in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) were conducted and the following results were obtained. Twelve cases of bacterial infections were treated with CMNX with a satisfactory result of "excellent" in 9 and "good" in 3. Antibacterial activity was examined in 7 cases. Pathogenic organisms which were S. aureus, beta-Streptococcus, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. morganii were eradicated in all the cases. Mean maximum serum concentrations of CMNX after intravenous injection of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg were 54.5 mcg/ml, 102.3 mcg/ml and 202.4 mcg/ml, respectively which were obtained 15 minutes after each injection. Mean half-lives of each dose group were 1.60, 1.13 and 1.51 hours, respectively. Mean urinary excretion rates of CMNX at 6 hours after intravenous injection in 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg groups were 73.5%, 80.9%, 92.6% and 66.5%, respectively. Side effects were not observed clinically, but anemia in 1 case and eosinophilia in 2 cases were noted in laboratory examination.
TI  - Effect of automatic backflushing on number of new intramammary infections, bacteria on teatcup liners, and milk iodine.
AB  - Effect of an automatic iodine (15 ppm) backflushing system on incidence of new intramammary infections, teatcup liner bacterial populations, and milk iodine was tested in a herd free of Streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus. In an 11-mo trial, backflushing was applied to teatcups that milked the right half of the udder; the left half served as control. Clawpieces were divided into left and right halves with each having a milk outlet. Postmilking teat dipping was discontinued. All lactating cows in the University herd were used, averaging 154 with normal attrition and additions of new individuals as they calved. Backflushing reduced numbers of staphylococci recovered from liners by 98.5% and Gram-negative bacteria by 99.5% as compared with unflushed liners. Backflushing significantly reduced new infections caused by Corynebacterium bovis. However, there was no effect on incidence of new infections by staphylococci, streptococci, or coliforms. Iodine concentrations averaged 243 micrograms per liter in milk from control quarters and 486 micrograms from backflushed udder halves. Interior surface cracking was more severe in backflushed teatcup liners than in control liners. These results do not justify the use of backflushing in a herd with low prevalence of contagious pathogens.
TI  - Efficacy evaluation of two new teat dip formulations under experimental challenge.
AB  - Two new teat dip formulations were evaluated against Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus in half-udder, experimental challenge studies. The first product contained a combination of 1.9% linear dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid - .55% iodophor. Incidence of infection was reduced 52.7 and 70.7% for Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus in dipped quarters compared to undipped controls. The second formulation was a barrier-type product consisting of milk protein solubilized with lauryl sulfate, a surface active detergent and 4.8% glycerin. Rates of infection were reduced 60.3 and 67.9% for Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Role of oxygen radicals in the bacteriostatic effect of whey and production of bacterial growth by free radical scavengers.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effect of milk was determined by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. Using whey as substrate, catalase, haemoglobin combined with ascorbic acid and xanthine oxidase inhibitors all provided protection against oxygen toxicity for a strain of Staphylococcus aureus and of Streptococcus agalactiae. Superoxide dismutase and mannitol were less effective. This was evident in whey alone and in the presence of oxygen radicals produced exogenously by the t-butylhydroperoxide, H2O2 and xanthine/xanthine oxidase systems.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Early recognition of the CAMP-reactivity in group B streptococci.
AB  - Early detection of the CAMP-reactivity of group B streptococci was achieved in 5% sheep or bovine blood agar supplemented with maltose or glucose at a final concentration of 0.04% under aerobic as well as under microaerobic conditions in a candle jar. All 55 cultures of group B streptococci tested on these media yielded distinct CAMP-reactions within 8 to 10 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, allowing a more rapid recognition of these streptococci.
TI  - Reversible inhibition of bacterial growth after specific inhibition of spermidine synthase by dicyclohexylamine.
AB  - The effect of dicyclohexylamine on seven freshly isolated bacterial strains of mastitis pathogens was studied. Streptococcus uberis was the most sensitive strain investigated, since 5 mM-dicyclohexylamine totally arrested its growth and 1.25 mM of the drug caused 60% growth inhibition. The Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also sensitive to the drug, but less so than Strep. uberis, since 5 mM drug caused only partial inhibition of growth. Micrococcus sp. and Klebsiella sp. grew in the presence of 10.0 mM-dicyclohexylamine, and, finally the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae was not at all affected by dicyclohexylamine. These different sensitivities towards dicyclohexylamine in vivo were paralleled by different sensitivities of the bacteria's spermidine synthase to the drug in vitro, and also by the ability of the drug to lower spermidine concentration in bacterial cells. Spermidine synthase from sensitive bacteria was inhibited by more than 90% by 50 microM-dicyclohexylamine in vitro, and the concentration of spermidine was decreased in E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa by 70% and in Strep. uberis by 95%, whereas in Strep. agalactiae 5 mM-dicyclohexylamine did not affect the concentration of spermidine at all. Dicyclohexylamine treatment led to the accumulation of putrescine in Strep. uberis. Spermidine synthesis catalysed by the extracts of Micrococcus sp. required 500 microM-dicyclohexylamine for 90% inhibition, and Strep. agalactiae contained a spermidine synthase that was still active at 1000 microM-dicyclohexylamine, The observed inhibition of growth was totally reversed by adding 50 microM-spermidine (final concentration) to the medium. Putrescine reversed the inhibition only when bacteria had a spermidine synthase activity insensitive to dicyclohexylamine. Spermine did not overcome the inhibition of growth caused by dicyclohexylamine, probably because it was not taken up by the bacterial cells used in this study. The inhibition of the growth by dicyclohexylamine (even in the case of Strep. uberis) was reversible in the sense that addition of 50 microM-spermidine 18 h after dicyclohexylamine still restored the growth rate of untreated controls.
TI  - A new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  - Several tests, bacitracin, CAMP, pyroglutamic acid-B-naphthylamide test (PYR test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. Bacitracin correctly identified all of the group A streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group A. The PYR reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group A streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. The PYR reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Both the salt tolerance test and the PYR reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group D streptococci as non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Pigment production by group B streptococci was more reliable than the CAMP test for identifying group B streptococci. The combination of PYR, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.
TI  - [The effect of hormonal preparations on superovulation and egg transport in ewes].
AB  - The relation between the prevalence of contagious mastitis with the finding of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and the number of somatic cells in the tank samples of milk was studied on the basis of a clinical and bacteriological examination of 11 129 dairy cows on four large farms, with a capacity of 600 to 1240 animals. A statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the analyzed characteristics (r = 0.621). The relation was demonstrated at a prevalence up to 25.3%. The number of somatic cells provides a marked indication of prevalence only from 10%. We failed to demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between the prevalence of mastitis with a cultivation finding significant correlation between the prevalence of mastitis with a cultivation finding of Staphylococcus aureus and the number of somatic cells in tank samples of milk (r = 0.054). The results suggest that on large farms it will not be possible to use only the number of somatic cells in tank milk samples as a signal of diagnostic improvement and preventive mastitis-control measures, since a 10% prevalence of these diseases usually excludes the possibility of herd sanitation.
TI  - [Relation of the count of somatic cells in tank samples to the incidence of contagious mastitis on large farms].
AB  - The relation between the prevalence of contagious mastitis with the finding of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and the number of somatic cells in the tank samples of milk was studied on the basis of a clinical and bacteriological examination of 11 129 daily cows on four large farms, with a capacity of 600 to 1240 animals. A statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the analyzed characteristics (r = 0.621). The relation was demonstrated at a prevalence up to 25.3%. The number of somatic cells provides a marked indication of prevalence only from 10%. We failed to demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between the prevalence of mastitis with a cultivation finding of Staphylococcus aureus and the number of somatic cells in tank samples of milk (r = 0.054). The results suggest that on large farms it will not be possible to use only the number of somatic cells in tank milk samples as a signal of diagnostic improvement and preventive mastitis-control measures, since a 10% prevalence of these diseases usually excludes the possibility of herd sanitation.
TI  - Prevalence of mastitis pathogens in herds participating in a mastitis control program.
AB  - Bacteriological data from herd surveys by the Massachusetts Mastitis Laboratory were analyzed. Comparisons of percent cows and quarters with major mastitis pathogens and types of bacteria isolated were between Streptococcus agalactiae-positive (1105 cows from 17 herds) and Streptococcus agalactiae-negative herds (1088 cows from 17 herds). Major mastitis pathogens were isolated from 58.5% of cows and 37.0% quarters in Streptococcus agalactiae-positive herds. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, and together these accounted for 87% of organisms isolated. In contrast, major mastitis pathogens were isolated from only 26.3% of cows and 10.2% of quarters in Streptococcus agalactiae negative herds. Streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coliforms were the predominant organisms isolated. Seventeen additional Streptococcus agalactiae negative herds were surveyed annually over 6 yr. An average of 25.8% of cows and 10.3% of quarters were positive for major mastitis pathogens during this time. The predominant bacteria isolated were streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coliforms. There was little variation between years.
TI  - The effect of udder infection on the bacterial flora of the bulk milk of ten dairy herds.
AB  - The significance of udder infection as a factor increasing the bacterial count of herd bulk milk was measured monthly for one year in ten dairy herds in Southern England. Staphylococcus aureus or mastitis streptococci were detected in 86% of samples, usually in numbers between 1000 and 10 000 c.f.u./ml of milk. However, in 8 and 2% of samples respectively greater than 20 000 or 100 000 c.f.u. of mastitis pathogens/ml of milk were detected. This occurred most commonly in the herds with a high incidence of Streptococcus uberis mastitis. The total bacterial counts of the herds' milks varied between 13 960 and 46 230 c.f.u./ml in the winter and between 6510 and 63 000 c.f.u./ml in the summer. No correlation was found between bacteriological quality of herd milk and the cleanliness of the milking machine and pipeline as assessed by plant rinses.
TI  - Evaluation of teat dips with excised teats.
AB  - Thirty-eight teat dip formulations were evaluated for germicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae with an excised teat model. Twenty-six of 27 iodophor products provided log reductions greater than 3 against Staphylococcus aureus, but only 13 against Streptococcus agalactiae. Log reductions obtained with two .2% quaternary ammonium and .5% cetylpyridium chloride products were greater than 4 against both organisms. A 1% benzyl alcohol formulation provided log reductions of 3.86 and 4.30 against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Germicidal activities of six novel formulations containing sodium chlorite were determined. Two products were effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae with log reductions greater than 4. One product provided a log reduction of 3; three products were ineffective.
TI  - Successive extraction of specific protective immunoglobulins from pooled human sera.
AB  - By use of pooled human sera, specific protective immunoglobulins against the Smith-diffuse strain of Staphylococcus aureus, strains SS-620 and SS-619 of types III and II group B streptococci, and strain K-9 of Klebsiella pneumoniae were successively extracted from their whole cell and antibody complexes by elution with propionic acid containing 5% sucrose. Injection of 0.14, 0.05, 0.09, and 0.15 mg of these eluates in mice gave protection against lethal infection only with homologous strains. However, no protective effect was observed against these infections, even with considerably higher amounts of a conventional immunoglobulin preparation. The major components of the eluates were the three major immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM, although nonspecific proteins were also included. Protective activities of these eluates were absorbed out by their protection-inducing antigens, indicating that they contained specific protective immunoglobulins.
TI  - Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.
AB  - Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
TI  - The importance of hygienic procedures in controlling mastitis.
AB  - Properly designed and instituted sanitation will improve milk quality and reduce  mastitis. The majority of mammary infections occur during milking. Since the populations of pathogenic organisms on the teat are directly correlated to the incidence of udder infections, hygienic practices in the milking parlor are of major importance to accomplish effective mastitis control. The organisms causing mastitis have two general sources. The contagious pathogens originating from infected udders are passed from cow to cow. The environmental agents are ubiquitous, gaining entrance to the mammary gland from external sources; they do not rely on intramammary infection for survival in the dairy environment. Cow hygiene in the milking parlor consists of three separate steps: premilking cleansing, sanitation of the milking unit between cows, and covering the teats with a germicide after milking. Each step has separate requirements in terms of product selection, concentration of germicide, time commitment, and mechanical assistance. Premilking sanitation is most effective against coliform-like infections as well as the other environmentals. Unit flushing and teat dipping are the greater deterrents to infection from the contagious pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Mycoplasma species. Extra care needs to be given to hygiene measures when infusing the mammary gland with antibiotics. Dipping the teats in an effective germicide both before and after infusion is highly effective in reducing mammary infections. Fresh cows and sick cows are both highly susceptible to infection. Only minimal sanitation of these animals while milking is generally practiced. Dipping prior to milking and leaving the germicide in contact with the teat while milking can be recommended as an additional procedure to reduce pathogens. All products used during milking should bear the label for product safety in food environments, and judicious use should not threaten product safety through potential residues.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis in infancy: report of three cases and review of the literature.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis exists on a continuum of soft tissue infections between cellulitis and myonecrosis. It has been uncommonly reported in infancy (1-10). The diagnosis depends on recognition of the characteristic rapidly progressive clinical course and demonstration of full-thickness skin necrosis with involvement of the fascial planes overlying the muscle. The organisms most often recovered are beta-hemolytic Streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus, but other aerobic and anaerobic organisms in single or mixed infection have been reported (1, 2, 11, 12). This infection has a significant mortality rate, necessitating early, aggressive, specific medical and surgical treatment.
TI  - Comparative effect of selected adjuvants on the response in the bovine mammary gland to staphylococcal and streptococcal antigens.
AB  - The effect of 4 adjuvants on the response in the lactating bovine mammary gland to an antigenic stimulus was examined. Fifty four lactating Holstein Friesian cows were randomly allocated to 6 groups. Four of these groups received a staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterin-toxoid vaccine administered systemically in association with an adjuvant preparation. The adjuvants used were: aluminum hydroxide gel, Freund's incomplete adjuvant, a metabolizable lipid emulsion and Bordetella pertussis. Two further groups serving as controls received saline, or the vaccine suspended in saline only. The immunoglobulin G response specific for each of 3 vaccine antigens, was monitored in the milk by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for a period of 23 weeks. The results indicated that high levels of antibody may be maintained in the milk, throughout the average lactation, if cows are vaccinated in the region of the supramammary lymph node with an optimum dose of antigen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant.
TI  - Assessment in the mouse of cefoperazone as a treatment for mastitis.
AB  - The value of cefoperazone in mastitis therapy was assessed in the mouse model of  mastitis primarily by its effect on bacterial cell numbers in the gland. In addition histological studies showed that the drug was not an irritant in the mammary gland. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that it was slowly absorbed from the gland (six days to absorb 500 micrograms) but was easily removed by milking. In ascending order of efficacy cefoperazone (500 micrograms/gland) was active against four-hour-old intramammary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Strep uberis. The effect against Staph aureus was titrated down to a dose of 50 micrograms/gland. Cefoperazone was not bactericidal against intracellular staphylococci but it did sensitise them to the action of lytic enzyme. Cefoperazone and cloxacillin behaved similarly against progressive staphylococcal mastitis. Both antibiotics significantly reduced the bacterial numbers when four-hour-old infections were treated but the effect on 26-hour-old infections was perceptible only when each antibiotic was assayed against saline treatment in the mouse. The results suggest that further studies in dairy cattle should be undertaken.
TI  - Evaluation of linear dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid teat dip under experimental challenge.
AB  - Linear dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid at 1.94% was evaluated as a teat dip in two  experimental challenge trials. Each trial was 4 wk, and a half udder design was used. In the first trial the product reduced incidence of intramammary infection with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29740) by 82.5%. Incidence of infection with Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 27956) was reduced nonsignificantly 19.5%. Ineffectiveness was attributed to challenge with Streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations higher than previously used. In a second trial of only Streptococcus agalactiae, infections were reduced 56.9%; concentrations of challenge suspensions were those routinely used.
TI  - Effect of vitamin E and selenium supplementation on incidence of clinical mastitis and duration of clinical symptoms.
AB  - Incidence of clinical mastitis and duration of clinical symptoms for complete lactations were evaluated for 80 cows randomly assigned to one of four groups: vitamin E supplemented- and selenium injected, selenium injected, vitamin E supplemented, and controls. Vitamin E supplementation and selenium injection were during the dry period. Log-linear analysis of incidence data revealed a significant 37% reduction of clinical mastitis by vitamin E. Incidence was not affected by selenium alone, nor was there any evidence for interaction of vitamin E with selenium on incidence. However, duration of clinical symptoms (calendar months clinical/quarter lactating) was reduced by 46% for the selenium group, 44% for the vitamin E group, and 62% for the vitamin E-selenium group as compared to controls. We conclude that dairy cow diets deficient of vitamin E may elevate incidence of clinical mastitis. Selenium deficiency may result in greater duration of clinical symptoms, and selenium may interact with vitamin E. Coliform bacteria and species of streptococcus other than Streptococcus agalactiae were isolated from 70% of the clinical cases.
TI  - Relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  - Objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. Approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo) infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. Relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. Largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important economically, but average differences were much smaller. Selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.
TI  - Glucose levels in normal and mastitic milk.
AB  - Glucose levels in 188 quarter for milks from different cows were determined by an enzymic procedure. Mean glucose content was 0.22 mM (standard error +/- 0.009) and results ranged from 0.02-0.57 mM. Abnormal quarters had lower glucose levels (P less than 0.01) than normal quarters but variability within each classification was large. Glucose content was negatively correlated with both somatic cell count (r = 0.49) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase level (r = -0.61). Milk glucose was considered to be of limited value as a diagnostic test for mastitis.
TI  - The susceptibility of bovine udder quarters colonized with Corynebacterium bovis  to experimental infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Twenty bovine udder quarters colonized with Corynebacterium bovis SR6 and 20 uncolonized quarters were challenged by inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305 (ATCC 29740) into the teat cistern. The percentage of infection in quarters colonized with C. bovis (50%) was significantly lower than that in controls (100%). By similar challenge no significant difference was observed between the percentage of infection with Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956 in 33 quarters colonized with C. bovis (70%) compared to 33 controls (87.9%). A total of 37 quarters colonized with C. bovis and 37 control quarters were challenged with Staph. aureus Newbould 305 (ATCC 29740) and Maxi (ATCC 27543) and Strep. agalactiae (ATCC 27956) by exposure of the teat orifice. The percentage of teat ducts colonized with C. bovis which became infected with either pathogen was not different from that for controls.
TI  - Correlation between opsonic activity for various microorganisms and composition of gammaglobulin preparations for intravenous use.
AB  - In this study 12 commercial immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration were investigated with respect to their opsonic activity for various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci, and in addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments, and IgG aggregates (dimers) was determined. The results show that four preparations that had been treated with enzyme or by reduction and alkylation had hardly any opsonic activity; the other preparations were as effective as inactivated serum. A statistical analysis showed an excellent correlation between the concentration of intact IgG molecules in a preparation and the opsonic activity for the various bacteria; a negative correlation between the concentration of IgG fragments and the opsonic activity was found. The combination of the two techniques used in this study provides a basis for recommendations on the choice of gammaglobulin preparations for clinical use.
TI  - Comparative opsonic activity of intravenous gamma globulin preparations for common bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Immune globulin intravenous is a reduced and alkylated preparation of gamma globulin that is stabilized in 10 percent maltose and 0.1 M glycine at pH 6.8. Recently, a modified immune globulin intravenous preparation was developed that is identical to the standard preparation except that it does not contain glycine and the pH has been lowered to 5.25. The effect of these modifications has resulted in a higher IgG monomer content in the preparation. In the present studies the opsonic activity against several common bacterial pathogens was assessed in the standard (pH 6.8) versus the more acidic immune globulin intravenous (pH 5.25). Opsonic activity was detected in each preparation for Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. With all of the organisms except S. marcescens, an intact complement system was required for optimal uptake and killing with each preparation. In general, the opsonic activity of the pH 5.25 immune globulin intravenous was equivalent to the standard pH 6.8 preparation. With several organisms, however, the more acidic preparation had greater activity than the standard one. An immune globulin intravenous preparation with increased antibody titers to P. aeruginosa was also prepared from selected donors and tested for opsonic activity against six of the seven Pseudomonas immunotypes. This preparation was found to have strikingly increased opsonic titers for most of the Pseudomonas immunotypes when compared with the standard immune globulin intravenous. These studies indicate that changes in donor selection or minor modifications in production techniques may markedly affect the biologic activity of intravenous gamma globulin.
TI  - Relationship between the level of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in bovine milk and the presence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Changes in the level of the tissue damage marker enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in quarter fore milks were found to be related to the presence and types of pathogenic bacteria present and to somatic cell counts (SCC). Minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium bovis) elicited a mild SCC increase (from a mean of 243 X 10(3)/ml in healthy quarters to 504 X 10(3)/ml in infected quarters) with marginal tissue damage (mean NAGase activity increased from 21 in healthy quarters to 28 in infected quarters). Major pathogens (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. dysgalactiae and Str. uberis) caused more severe tissue damage (mean NAGase of 48) and SCC increases (mean, 2803 X 10(3)/ml). The NAGase test could also be used effectively on composite milk samples where regular monthly NAGase analysis was able to identify correctly 74% of animals having infected quarters. The possibility of combining SCC and NAGase data in order to give a more definite diagnosis of bovine mastitis is discussed.
TI  - [Gonococcal infections in Gabon (Haut-Ogooue)].
AB  - The isolation of N. gonorrhoeae in the region of Franceville was attempted on the one hand with 261 men and 261 women presenting urethral or cervical discharge, and on the other hand with 530 women attending a prenatal clinic of whom 42 had cervical discharge while 488 did not. Amongst the men, 69.7% of the urethritis cases were due to N. gonorrhoeae while this bacteria could be isolated from 15.3% of the women with cervical exudates. N. gonorrhoeae could be also identified in 5.5% of the pregnant women of whom 79% were without exudate. The frequency of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from STD consultations was 440 cases per year per 100,000 while the male: female ratio was 4.6. The isolation rate from pregnant women would indicate however a frequency in women in excess of 1 500 cases per 100,000. The isolation of N. gonorrhoeae was tabulated according to the age of the patients. The 15-20 year group was clearly the most frequently infected. Trichomonas was observed in 2% of the men and 23% of the women with discharges. Yeasts (chiefly Candida albicans) were found in 23.5% of the women but in none of the men.
TI  - [Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration for mastitis pathogens in  cattle].
AB  
TI  - Haem compounds as bacterial growth promoters in whey: a possible application to bovine mastitis.
AB  - The enhancing effect of haem compounds on the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in whey cultures was studied turbidometrically. Catalase, myoglobin and haemoglobin in concentrations 10(-5) to 10(-3) M enhanced bacterial growth. One explanation of this was the availability of iron by these haem compounds for the bacteria. However, evidence from experiments on free radical generating systems by t-BHP and hydrogen peroxide indicated that haem compounds scavenge activated oxygen products and so protect bacteria from oxygen toxicity.
TI  - Chloralanyl and propargylglycyl dipeptides. Suicide substrate containing antibacterials.
AB  - A set of dipeptides containing the amino acid residues beta-chloroalanine and propargylglycine, which are mechanism-based inactivators of purified microbial enzymes (alanine racemase and cystathionine gamma-synthase, respectively), have been synthesized, and their antibacterial properties in vitro have been evaluated. Dipeptides containing a single beta-chloro-L-alanyl residue (e.g., 3, 5, 9, and 10) or a single L-propargylglycyl residue (e.g., 12 and 15) are potent antibacterials. The in vitro antibiotic activity of beta-chloro-L-alanine and of L-propargylglycine is increased as much as 4000-fold by incorporation of these residues into a dipeptide. Compounds that contain only a single enzyme-inactivating amino acid together with a second L-alanyl residue (3, 5, 12, and 15) have a restricted range of activity: of the species tested, only Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis are sensitive. However, peptides that contain two suicide-substrate residues [e.g., beta-Cl-LAla-beta-Cl-LAla (8) or LppGly-LppGly (18)] are broad-spectrum antibacterials; as many as 12 different species of the 16 surveyed are sensitive. Dipeptides that contain an amino-terminal L-methionyl (9) or an L-norvalyl (10) residue and a carboxy-terminal beta-chloro-L-alanyl unit are also effective against a large number of organisms; the spectra of activity are like those seen for 8 and 18. A "mixed" dipeptide [beta-Cl-LAla-LppGly, (21)] gives apparent synergism of antibiotic action of beta-chloro-L-alanine and of L-propargylglycine when these two residues are incorporated into a single structure. Peptides of the D,D configuration (4, 6, 13, 16, and 20) and ones of L,D stereochemistry (e.g., 7) are not antibacterials. Peptides containing one (11 and 14) and two (17) D,L-propargylglycyl residues are unresolved sets of diastereomers; the mixtures of compounds are between two- and fourfold less active than the correspondingly resolved L,L dipeptides (12, 15, and 18). These findings are consistent with a mechanism of action for these antibiotics involving stereoselective processing of the peptidyl unit in vivo.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Effects of antibiotic treatment of nonlactating dairy cows on antibiotic resistance patterns of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance patterns of the major groups of bovine mastitis pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were examined by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 13 different antibiotics against bacterial isolates from dairy cattle. The bacterial strains were obtained from milk samples from each cow in 21 New York state dairy herd surveys. In 12 herd surveys (high antibiotic-use group), all 365 cows received antibiotic infusions into the udder at the cessation of each lactation cycle. The 324 animals in the other nine herd surveys (low antibiotic-use group) did not routinely receive antibiotics during the nonlactation period. The MICs from the two groups were compared by calculating for each bacterial group the average MIC, the antibiotic concentration necessary to inhibit 90% of the isolates, and the antibiotic concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of the isolates. Increased resistance to all 13 antibiotics was observed with Streptococcus agalactiae isolates from the high antibiotic use herds. However, there was relatively little difference between the two groups in the resistance patterns of the other bacterial species examined. The most important finding of the study was the identification of a multiple beta-lactam resistance phenotype in Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - [Choice of nutrient media for the laboratory diagnosis of Streptococcus group B].
AB  - The comparative study of a large assortment of liquid and solid culture media used for the cultivation of streptococci in laboratory practice in the USSR and abroad was carried out with the aim of selecting the optimal media for the laboratory diagnosis of group B. streptococci. Liquid media were tested with the use of 7 streptococcal reference strains, and some of these media, found to yield the best results, were selected for tests on clinical material. The use of liquid accumulation media was shown to permit the isolation of group B. streptococcal strains which could not be detected by the direct inoculation of clinical material into dishes with blood agar. The character of hemolysis induced by group B. streptococci in solid media with 5% of blood added was found to depend on the composition of the medium and the conditions of cultivation.
TI  - Mastitis control: a discussion.
AB  - Methods of mastitis control that are effective against Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus have been developed and proven successful. These control procedures, however, are not as effective against the environmental pathogens. Environmental pathogens are predominantly the coliform bacteria and species of streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae. The total extent of their present involvement in mastitis is not well documented, and this is due in part to differences in the nature of infection by environmental pathogens compared to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infections. Concern regarding the importance of environmental pathogens in mastitis is increasing. This concern is based, first, on current trends of dairy cattle housing and management that increase exposure to teat ends to environmental pathogens and, second, on a reduction of prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infected quarters. The latter is a result of the effectiveness of postmilking teat end disinfection and dry cow therapy. Development of equally effective control methods for the environmental pathogens will be an important area of future mastitis research.
TI  - Action of EDTA-Tris and antimicrobial agent combinations on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The concentration of EDTA-Tris (3.22 mM EDTA and 0.05 M Tris) used as a lavage to treat otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections in dogs and cats, was found to prevent the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and beta streptococci when present in growth media. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rapidly lysed in this solution. Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris grew in the presence of EDTA-Tris, but to a lesser extent than the controls without these compounds. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 8 antimicrobial agents with and without EDTA-Tris were determined for E. coli and P. vulgaris. A potentiation effect on E. coli (greater than 50% decrease MIC) was observed when EDTA-Tris was combined with penicillin, oxytetracycline or chloramphenicol. A similar effect was observed with P. vulgaris when combinations of EDTA-Tris plus gentamicin, oxytetracycline, polymyxin-B or triple sulfa were used. The results of this study indicate that EDTA-Tris appears to have merit in selected cases of otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections where lavage might be used.
TI  - Clinical trial of cefonicid for treatment of skin infections.
AB  - Twenty patients with skin and soft-tissue infections were treated with parenteral cefonicid. Cultures obtained in cellulitis cases from an aspirate of a leading edge of inflammation were positive in 42% of these patients. Pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (six strains), Proteus mirabilis (one strain), and Streptococcus agalactiae. Adverse effects were pain on intramuscular injection (two patients), rash (one patient), and positive Coombs test (one patient). All side effects were mild and none required discontinuing antibiotic therapy. A single treatment failure occurred in a patient with an undrained perirectal abscess. Cefonicid may be a useful drug in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections. The long half-life of cefonicid (4.8 h) is a valuable advantage and may facilitate patient compliance and convenience.
TI  - Germicidal teat dip in a herd with low prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  - Effectiveness of an iodophor teat dip in reducing new intramammary infection and  clinical mastitis was tested in a herd free of Streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections. In this 6-mo study with an average of 152 lactating cows on trial on sampling dates, right rear and left front teats were dipped after each milking while right front and left rear teats were undipped controls. Teat dipping significantly reduced new infections by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (other than Streptococcus agalactiae), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium bovis and reduced clinical cases caused by infections established during the trial. However, the dip did not reduce new infections or clinical mastitis caused by coliform bacteria. Therefore, use of a germicidal dip is recommended for herds with a low prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, but the practice should not be expected to control coliform mastitis.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Subpreputial carriage of aerobic micro-organisms and balanitis.
AB  - Men attending a genitourinary medicine clinic had an appreciably higher prevalence of subpreputial infection with group B streptococci (GBS) than with Staphylococcus aureus or coliform bacilli. Carriage of GBS was similar in older and younger age groups and was higher in homosexuals than heterosexuals and in those with balanitis than those without. Thus, while GBS may cause balanitis in heterosexuals, sexual transmission is unimportant; in contrast sexual transmission of GBS may be more common among homosexuals but balanitis is rare.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefotiam against clinical isolates in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) against clinically isolated organisms in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was discussed as follows: In the point of view of the MICs peak, CTM was 1-fold worse than CEZ against Gram-positive bacteria, while, in the case of the concentration of CTM required to inhibit the growth of 80% or 90% of the total number of tested Gram-positive organism, antibacterial activity of CTM was approximately identical with that of CEZ, CMZ or SBPC. CTM against E. coli, K, pneumoniae, P. Mirabilis was 16-32-fold more effective than CEZ and 4-16-fold than CMZ. Against indole-positive organisms with CEZ was no effective, CTM was considerably effective. But antibacterial activity of CTM against B. fragilis was insufficient. However, in the case that no spore forming anaerobic organism involved in infectious disease, it is said that existence of aerobic organism is important. As E. coli is representative of aerobic organism, CTM with potent antibacterial activity against this organism is seemed to be effective antibiotic for the gynecological infection.
TI  - Subclinical mastitis of beef cows.
AB  - Two beef cow herds were investigated to determine the prevalence of subclinical mastitis and to determine whether it contributed to decreased weaning weight of calves nursed by affected cows. Quarter samples obtained about 30 days after calving were evaluated by the California mastitis test and by direct microscopic cell count. In 1 herd, a 92-cow confinement operation, 17 quarters of 12 cows were infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sp other than agalactiae, or Klebsiella sp. Mean 205-day adjusted weights were 203.9 kg and 218.2 kg for calves nursed by infected vs noninfected cows. In the other herd, a 75-cow range-pasture operation, 8 quarters of 8 cows were infected, all with S aureus. Mean 205-day adjusted weights were 162.5 kg and 174.6 kg for calves nursed by infected vs noninfected cows.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of Haemophilus somnus antibody in agglutination and complement fixation tests and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - The specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures in the detection of antibodies to Haemophilus somnus was investigated. H. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella dublin, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium pyogenes. In complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only H. agni reacted with H. somnus antisera to any significant degree. In ELISA tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two Pasteurella spp. and with H. agni. When whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in ELISAs, only H. agni showed any cross-reactivity. The greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by ELISA with saline extracts as antigens. Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus antigens failed to react with H. somnus antibody in any of the tests. A rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of P. multocida, P. haemolytica, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. dublin, C. pyogenes, and E. coli gave no positive reaction in ELISA tests with saline extract of H. somnus as antigen. It is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of H. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by ELISA of antibody response to H. somnus.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Alternative non-immune F(ab')2-mediated immunoglobulin binding to group C and G streptococci.
AB  - We tested 140 bacterial strains representing 19 different species for binding of  purified radiolabelled F(ab')2 fragments prepared by pepsin digestion of polyclonal and monoclonal human IgG. Both polyclonal and monoclonal F(ab')2 fragments showed positive binding to group C and G streptococci with maximum uptake levels of 50% and 85%. Binding was obtained both with fresh bacteria and with organisms stabilized by heat treatment. F(ab')2 fragments of two human IgG1 myeloma proteins with anti-staphylolysin specificity showed a similar binding pattern. IgG present in normal human serum inhibited the uptake of F(ab')2 fragments, whereas albumin and fibrinogen and purified Fc fragments prepared by papain digestion of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgG1 did not show such capacity. Fourteen human myeloma proteins representing IgA, IgM and the four IgG subclasses were tested for inhibiting capacity. Reactivity was noted with at least one myeloma protein within each IgG subclass but not with IgA or with IgM monoclonal proteins. Normal rabbit serum was as inhibitory as normal human serum, whereas dog serum was less reactive. These data demonstrate that group C and G streptococci carry a heat-stable surface component interacting with the F(ab')2 portion of the IgG molecule. The results suggest that the reactive site on the immunoglobulin molecule may reside in the more constant part of the variable domain. This new reactivity is different from the previously known non-immune reaction involving the IgG Fc portion. This alternative non-immune reactivity is analogous to but distinct from the alternative protein A reaction in Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Platelet aggregation by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Heat-killed group A Streptococcus pyogenes induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation was dependent upon the ratio of platelets to bacteria, with maximal aggregation occurring at 0.8 platelets per bacterium (final concentration, 300,000 per microliter). Inhibition of the reaction by 3 mM EDTA indicated it was a true aggregation and not merely adhesion and agglutination. Lactic acid dehydrogenase assays indicated lysis of platelets did not occur during a 6-min incubation period. Aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid (100 microM to 10 mM) and quinacrine (15.6 to 250 microM), with no decrease in aggregation at the lowest concentration of inhibitor tested. S. pyogenes induced the release of [14C]serotonin, which was maximal (50%) at 2.4 min, when aggregation was nearly complete. Gel-filtered platelets were not aggregated unless fibrinogen (final concentration, 1.8 mg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture. Staphylococcus aureus, a group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli were unable to induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma under the conditions used for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Bacteriological study of amniotic fluid during labor.
AB  - Amniotic fluid from 207 women in labor was analysed at the time of artificial rupture of membranes or by amniocentesis. The following organisms were identified in concentrations of more than 1 000/ml: Staphylococcus aureus (1), Propionibacterium (1), E. coli (1), group B Streptococci (3), Lactobacilli (16). The 6 patient-carriers of pathogens became infected as did 4 of their babies. Leukocyte counts and LDH levels performed on amniotic fluid did not correlate with the appearance of symptoms of infection. Quantitative bacteriology of amniotic fluid seems to be of value in identifying patients at high risk of developing endometritis and/or neonatal sepsis.
TI  - [Experimental mastitis in cows caused by Staphylococci, Streptococci and Corynebacteria].
AB  - Mastitis was experimentally induced in seven cows of the Black-and-white breed through the intramammary or i/v application of bacterial cultures of the encapsulated variant of Staph. epidermidis as well as of Str. agalactiae and Cor. pyogenes. The disease ran a course with high body temperature, strongly manifested inflammatory changes in the mammary gland, and altered phagocytic activity. It was found that the introduction into the mammary gland of a 'stable-specific' bovine blood serum in combination with the preparation nitrofuridine (a Shiff base of the 5-nitrofurfurol with sulfaguanidine) which boosts the phagocytic activity, had produced a therapeutic effect.
TI  - Evaluation of nine teat dip formulations under experimental challenge to staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Nine postmilking teat dips were evaluated by an experimental challenge model against either Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, or both. Formulations containing .9 and .6% sodium hypochlorite, 1% sodium dichloro-s-triazene-trione, .55% chlorhexidine gluconate, and .35% povidone iodine reduced incidence of Staphylococcus aureus infections 56.8, 28.3, 75.9, 92.5, and 77.9%. Incidence of infections with Streptococcus agalactiae was reduced 48.1 and 63.2% by 1.7 and 1% sodium dichloro-s-triazene-trione formulations. The 1% chlorhexidine gluconate and .35% povidone iodine products reduced Streptococcus agalactiae infections 71.0 and 67.0%. Three experimental 1% iodophor formulations reduced Streptococcus agalactiae infections 28.9, 44.8, and 50.7%. The experimental challenge model was refined further and provided an efficient method to determine efficacy of postmilking teat dips.
TI  - The influence of somatic cells of milk on the growth of staphylococci and streptococci in whey and serum.
AB  - Staphylococci differ from streptococci in susceptibility to somatic cells of milk which inhibit the growth of bacteria.
TI  - Growth inhibition of staphylococci and streptococci in raw milk.
AB  - The activity of quinaldofur and penicillin against staphylococci and streptococci was influenced by aerobic conditions and by the presence of antibacterial agents in raw milk. The cooperation of these agents with penicillin against streptococci but not against staphylococci was mainly observed. On the other hand, one strain of staphylococci was apparently protected against penicillin by agents present in active milk.
TI  - Growth of staphylococci and streptococci in raw milk.
AB  - Streptococci were found to grow better in raw milk with redox potential similar to that inside the udder than staphylococci. In these redox conditions in active milk containing about 10(6) somatic cells per 1 ml, both streptococci and staphylococci survive but only some strains grow. In aerobic conditions active milk inhibited the growth of streptococci more than that of staphylococci.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of acute mastitis in a large dairy herd.
AB  - In a 270-cow dairy herd, milk samples from all cows with acute mastitis were cultured during a 12-month period. Of 119 isolates (from 166 quarters), 49% were gram-positive organisms, 39% were gram-negative organisms, and 12% were yeasts. Of all samples from cows with acute mastitis, 40% failed to produce colonies on culture media. Recovery of the common gram-positive pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus (11% of isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1% of isolations), was rather low. However, S epidermidis (14% of isolations) and streptococci other than Str agalactiae (9% of isolations) were recovered more frequently than expected, particularly in recently calved cows. Coliform organisms accounted for 35% of the total isolates and were the single most important cause of acute mastitis. Of 42 cows with coliform mastitis, 6 died despite intensive antibiotic and electrolyte therapy. There was no death loss among cows with mastitis caused by gram-positive organisms. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of 95 isolates to 11 antimicrobials was determined by standardized methods. Organisms were most often susceptible to chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and gentamicin. A treatment regimen consisting primarily of oxytetracycline and/or sulfonamides systemically in conjunction with intramammary infusions of cephapirin was evaluated. Treatment response in 37 quarters was determined by culturing before treatment and at 4 or more days after treatment. Of 23 quarters initially culture-positive, 22 were negative on reculture. Treatment response appeared to agree with the results of the susceptibility testing.
TI  - Short-time low-temperature pasteurisation of human milk.
AB  - Using the Oxford Human Milk Pasteuriser human milk was exposed to lower temperature and shorter time periods than employed in classical holder pasteurisation. Heating human milk at 62.5 degrees C for 5 min completely destroyed Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated into the samples. Heating at 56.0 degrees C for 15 min destroyed over 99% of the inoculated organisms. The mean percentage remaining activity of certain antimicrobial proteins after heat treatment at 62.5 degrees C for 30 min, 62.5 degrees C for 5 min and 56 degrees C for 15 min were as follows: IgA 67, and 90%; lactoferrin 27, 59 and 91%; and lysozyme 67, 96 and 106%, respectively. These results suggest that human milk can be effectively pasteurised using less heat treatment than in classical holder pasteurisation. Lower temperature and shorter heat treatment also preserves substantially more of the activity of the antimicrobial proteins present in human milk.
TI  - Antibody response in lacteal secretions of cows after immunization with various concentrations of staphylococcal and streptococcal antigens.
AB  - A total of 55 lactating Holstein cows were randomly allocated to 6 groups. Five of these groups (No. 2 through 6) were inoculated on 2 occasions in the region of the external inguinal lymph node with various concentrations of 3 bacterial antigens. Saline solution was administered to group 6 as a control. The antigen preparations consisted of a Staphylococcus aureus bacterin, a Streptococcus agalactiae bacterin, and staphylococcal alpha-toxoid. These antigens were administered as a composite preparation suspended in saline solution. The concentration of antibody in the lacteal secretions, represented by immunoglobulin G specific for each of the 3 vaccine antigens, was monitored during the 18-week experimental period by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentration of each of the 3 vaccine components which was required to stimulate a maximal immune response in the lactating gland appears to have been established.
TI  - Group b Streptococcal pneumonia in the elderly.
AB  - Group B streptococcal infections, although well studied in neonates, have only recently been appreciated as important infectious agents in adults. Seven cases of Group B streptococcal pneumonia were verified by transtracheal aspiration, blood and sputum cultures, or multiple stab cultures at autopsy. The infections were largely nosocomial and, ultimately, fatal in all seven patients. Our patients were older (average age, 73 years) and much more debilitated than the 13 cases reported in the literature. Diabetes was less common than previously reported. Previous antibiotic therapy was common. Concomitant isolation of another organism (especially Staphylococcus aureus) occurred in five patients. The morphologic findings at autopsy, in one patient, were characterized by a severely necrotizing destructive process. In our experience, Group B streptococcal pneumonia is more common, more devastating, and occurs in an older population than previously reported.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of R-plasmids from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  - R-plasmids originally isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes(pAC1,pAM15346), Streptococcus agalactiae(pIP501), and Streptococcus faecalis(pAM beta 1) were shown to be self-transferable on filter membranes from S. faecalis JH2-2 to Staphylococcus aureus recipients. The nonconjugative plasmid pAM alpha 1 was mobilized into S. aureus by pAM beta 1. Once in S. aureus, conjugative R-plasmids could be transferred to a second S. aureus recipient or back into S. faecalis. Determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in S. aureus. Agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as self-replicating elements in S. aureus recipients.
TI  - [Microbiological evaluation of the results of penicillin Hx treatment of urinary  tract infection].
AB  
TI  - The use of polyethylene intramammary device in protection of the lactating bovine udder against experimental infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The susceptibility of lactating bovine udder quarters fitted with a polyethylene  intramammary device to infection was investigated. Following experimental challenge with Streptococcus agalactiae or Staphylococcus aureus, the incidence of infection was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in intramammary device-fitted quarters compared to control quarters. In general, total foremilk and strippings milk somatic cell counts for intramammary device-fitted and control quarters were not significantly (p less than 0.05) different. Differential foremilk and strippings milk somatic cell counts were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in samples from intramammary device-fitted quarters compared to control quarters.
TI  - Cross protection in mice with the Smith diffuse stain of Staphylococcus aureus versus a type Ia strain of group B streptococci.
AB  - Active immunization of mice with whole cell vaccine or cell surface polysaccharide from either the Smith diffuse strain of Staphylococcus aureus or SS-615 (type Ia of group G streptococci) protected against challenge by either the homologous or heterologous strains. In the peritoneal cavity of mice immunized with either of these organisms rapid phagocytosis and reduction of the viable cells was observed at 6 h after the challenge. Cell surface polysaccharides extracted from strains Smith diffuse and SS-615, both prepared by the same procedure as that of the Smith surface antigen, were capable of absorbing the protective antibody in rabbit hyperimmune sera prepared with homologous or heterologous strains.
TI  - Characterization of partially purified group B streptococcal clumping factor.
AB  - Using a strain of group B Streptococci, characteristics of the streptococcal clumping factor was investigated. In contrast to that of Staphylococcus, the streptococcal clumping factor reacted with plasmas from guinea-pig and sheep although staphylococcal clumping factor did not react with them. In addition, streptococcal clumping factor was resistant to heat, sonication, and chemical reagents; it was also degradable by proteolytic enzyme and galactose oxidase. Hydrochloric acid extract of the whole cell was subjected to Sephadex column chromatography and fraction containing streptococcal clumping factor was obtained. This fraction reacted selectively with fibrinogen in human plasma, caused paracoagulation, and the factor was presumed to be an acidic proteinaceous substance.
TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive cocci was studied by microdilution broth susceptibility tests and compared with the activities of clindamycin, vancomycin, oxacillin, and ampicillin. U-57930E inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus viridans at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. This degree of activity was generally slightly less than that of the other antimicrobial agents tested. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci were resistant to U-57930E. At the concentrations used, U-57930E exhibited bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms, and a minimal effect of inoculum size was noted.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus community acquired strains.
AB  - Over 250 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients who presented with infections acquired outside the hospital were tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, minocycline and erythromycin. Only 15.5% of strains could be regarded as sensitive to penicillin, whereas 99.2% and 90.2% were sensitive to minocycline and erythromycin respectively. Beta-haemolytic streptococci were found in association with Staph. aureus in 17.5% of the lesions cultured in this survey. The susceptibility of a further 100 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staph. aureus to a wider range of antimicrobial agents was also examined.
TI  - A survey of mastitis in selected ontario dairy herds.
AB  - A mastitis survey involving 74 Ontario dairy herds was conducted. The prevalence  of infection at the quarter level was found to be 4.1% with Streptococcus agalactiae, 4.5% with other streptococcal species and 8.0% with Staphylococcus aureus. Regardless of the infection status, the geometric mean somatic cell count was found to increase with age of the cow but no increase was observed with increasing stage of lactation. The percentage of cows from which a bacterial pathogen was isolated increased with age but not with stage of lactation.
TI  - A note on effectiveness of dry cow therapy in New Zealand dairy herds.
AB  - Two dry-cow therapy products were evaluated in seven factory-supply dairy herds in the Waikato area. A product containing neomycin sulphate and the benzathine salt of penicillin (Neopen D.C. White; Smith-Biolab) was used in five herds, and one containing benzathine cloxacillin (Orbenin, Beecham) was used in two herds. Non-treated control cows were included in each herd. Both products were effective in eliminating intramammary infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Efficacy of dry-cow therapy against S. aureus was 83.8% and 85.2% respectively. Spontaneous cure rate among controls was 30.8% for S. aureus during the dry period. Spontaneous cure rate for Str. uberis was 50%, while dry-cow therapy eliminated 100% and 77.8%, respectively, for the two products. Dry-cow therapy with either product eliminated more than 90% of Str. agalactiae infections while spontaneous cure rate was only 28.6%. These results further support the effectiveness of dry-cow therapy in reducing the level of subclinical mastitis in dairy herds by shortening the duration of intramammary infections.
TI  - A survey of clinical mastitis in South-East Queensland dairy herds.
AB  - A survey if clinical mastitis in 26 South-East Queensland dairy herds supplying more than 300,000 litres of milk annually, revealed a quarter incidence of 2.6% with a cow incidence of 9% over a 3-month period. Secretion samples from cows yielded Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus Uberis, Coliforms, Pseudomonas spp and other bacteria in 38.5%, 12.5%, 6.6%, 3.4%, 2.6%, 0.6% and 2.0% of cases respectively. Samples from 38% of the cases were culturally negative while at least 38% of the clinical quarters had shown a previous clinical episode of mastitis. There was a significant association (P less than 0.025) between herd and the likelihood of a negative culture result on samples from clinical cases. Twenty-one percent of cases occurred in the first month of lactation and 10.3% in the first week. There was a significant association (P less than 0.005) between the age of cow and the stage of lactation in which clinical cases occurred in that cows in the 2 to 5 year age group were more likely to suffer attacks in the earlier part of lactation. There was a highly significant relationship (P less than 0.005) between cow age group and the proportion of affected quarters and it was calculated that the change with each year of age was a 55% increase over the previous year. Forty-five percent of the isolates of S. aureus were resistant to penicillin.
TI  - An Evaluation of a Teat Dip with Dodecyl Benzene Sulfonic Acid in Preventing Bovine Mammary Gland Infection from Experimental Exposure to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The effectiveness of a teat dip with dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (1.94%) for the prevention of intramammary infections was determined in cows experimentally challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. The infection rates with Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus were 62.5% and 75% in undipped quarters, 12.5% and 21.5% in dipped quarters with a reduction rate of 80% and 71% respectively. The significance of some findings in relation to mastitis control are discussed.
TI  - [Sensitivity of agents of mastitis to various antibiotics].
AB  - Studied was the sensitivity to antibiotics of a total of 328 strains of mastitis-causative agents, employing the agar-diffusion method. Staphylococcus aureus proved most sensitive to cephacetril (100%), gentamycin (85.3%), and erythromycin (75.2%). Of the pathogenic streptococci Str. agalactiae was most sensitive to cephacetril (100%), chloramphenicol (100%), and tetracycline (92,8%), while Str. uberis and Str. dysgalactiae ranked second - cephacetril (88,2%), tetracycline (77.4%), and gentamycin (74.5%). Coliform bacteria were found to be most sensitive to streptomycin (75-77%), gentamycin (69-74%), and chloramphenicol (66-73%), and completely resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Corynebacteria were sensitive to most of the antibiotics - cephacetril (100%), chloramphenicol (83.8%), erythromycin (78.3%), gentamycin (75.6%), and ampicillin (72.9%). Usually, the mastitis causative agents showed polyresistance at one and the same time mostly to three (36.3%) and four (19%) antibiotics.
TI  - Biophotometric comparison of cephalexin and cephradine against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have compared the antibacterial activities of cephalexin and cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (Micrococcus spp. type III), and group B streptococci (35 strains in total), using the Biophotometer. Analysis of growth curves obtained in the presence of various concentrations of the antibiotics revealed little difference between the activities of the two cephalosporins. However, both antibiotics showed maximal activity at 8-16 microgram/ml, and increasing the concentration past this point resulted in a reduced antibacterial effect. Unlike the other species tested, streptococci were not lysed by cephalexin or cephradine.

TI  - [Culture medium for the isolation of group B Streptococcus].
AB  - Comparative studies were carried out on a new medium--a soybean agar of the Difco type with the addition of beta-staphylococcus toxin, washed sheep erythrocytes, esculin, and Congo red to isolate and differentiate the streptococci of the serologic B group. Congo red was used in dilution of 1:10000 to suppress the beta-hemolysis of the streptococci belonging to other serologic groups. The higher objectivity of the final results required the use of a blood agar and a medium with thallium sulfate and crystal violet--nutrient media for the bacteriologic diagnostics of mastitis. It was established with all three lines of research of selected cultures (control strains) through sampling milk of the four quarters of the udder and pooled milk by groups and farms that soybean agar proved superior to the remaining nutrient media, more specifically in the diagnosis of mastitis caused by streptococci of the serologic group.
TI  - The CAMP test performed by using Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase (beta-haemolysin) and Clostridium perfringens lecithinase.
AB  - The CAMP test was performed by employing Staphylococcus aureus beta-haemolysin (sphingomyelinase) and Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (lecithinase) for identification of group B streptococci on blood agar, using blood from different origin. Partial purification of Cl perfringens alpha-toxin was carried out by means of sheep erythrocytes. With the toxin preparations described positive CAMP reaction was obtained only on sheep blood agar. False positives with regard to group A streptococci could not be avoided by either of the methods.
TI  - Detection of mastitis.
AB  
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.

TI  - [Causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.
TI  - Effects of dietary aflatoxin on existing bacterial intramammary infections of dairy cows.
AB  - Aflatoxin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin with immunosuppressive properties, was given to 4 lactating dairy cows that had experimentally induced or naturally occurring mammary infections in 2 of their 4 mammary quarters. Aflatoxin was given orally in daily doses approximating 0.3 mg of B1 activity/kg of body weight for periods of 12 to 14 days. Infecting organisms were Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus hyicus. The 4 cows were monitored for clinical signs of disease and signs of mastitis for periods before, during, and after aflatoxin consumption. The cows developed inappetence, lost body weight, and had variable reductions in daily milk yield. Serum ornithine-carbamoyl transferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities were elevated during and 1 to 3 weeks after aflatoxin consumption. Exacerbations of acute clinical mastitis did not occur in any of the infected quarters; however, bacterial populations in the milk increased in 3 of the 4 cows during aflatoxin consumption. Mean California mastitis test scores were generally highest in the infected quarters in the period after the last dose of aflatoxin was given. Aflatoxin M1 appeared in milk 3 to 6 hours after aflatoxin consumption began, and persisted for 72 hours or longer after the last dose of aflatoxin was given. Aflatoxin B1 and M1 were present in urine samples taken at 6 hours after aflatoxin consumption began and persisted for 72 through 120 hours after the last dose of aflatoxin was given.
TI  - Cellulitis: treatment with cefoxitin compared with multiple antibiotic therapy.
AB  - Cefoxitin, a parenteral cephamycin beta-lactam antibiotic was prospectively evaluated as a single drug alternative in 31 children with cellulitis and the results of therapy were compared retrospectively with those from prevailing multiple antibiotic therapy for cellulitis in 56 children. Periorbital and lower extremity cellulitis accounted for more than 60% of the cases in both study groups. The most common bacterial agents included Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. In as many as 50% of the cases, no etiologic agent could be found. In addition to blood cultures, cellulitis leading edge aspirate cultures were helpful in establishing the etiologic diagnosis. Of 52 patients sampled in the combined studies, 21% had positive aspirate cultures in the presence of negative blood cultures. The outcome and mean duration of hospital stay were similar in both groups. No severe adverse reactions were encountered. The mean number of antibiotics used in the retrospective study was three (range 1 to 7) whereas cefoxitin alone was used in the prospective study. All organisms isolated in the prospective study were susceptible to cefoxitin. Single antibiotic therapy with cefoxitin appears to be as safe and as effective in the treatment of cellulitis in children as multiple antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  - A medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. Mannitol agar supported growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except Corynebacterium pyogenes. Color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. Most Staphylococcus aureus strains and some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. These yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from quarters with significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. Mannitol-negative strains of S epidermidis (those with red zones) were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters. The streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: Streptococcus agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, and group G streptococci produced red zones; Str uberis, Str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. Pathogenic streptococci (Str agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, Str uberis, and group G streptococci) were obtained from quarters with SCC significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. Pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of three antibiotic products for the treatment and prevention of subclinical mastitis during the dry period.
AB  - The comparative efficacy of a product containing 500 mg benzathine cloxacillin (Orbenin D.C.). another product containing 100 mg nafcillin, 300 mg procaine benzylpenicillin and 100 mg dihydrostreptomycin (Nafpenzal D.C.) and a third product containing 250 mg cephalonium (Cepravin D.C.), in the elimination and prevention of mastitis due to gram-positive microorganisms during the dry period was investigated in 1253 cows located in 14 herds in Israel. Although more uniform results were observed after treatment with Nafpenzal D.C. differences among herds were rather large. The mean cure rate for Staphylococcus aureus quarter infections was 81.4 per cent. New S. aureus infections which occurred between drying off and post calving sampling time were found in 7.0 per cent of the quarters. Dry period therapy reduced infection level with S. aureus from 13.5 per cent of quarters to 8.0 per cent. A similar proportional decrease was found in infection level due to non-agalactiae Streptococcus quarter infections.
TI  - Binding of fibrinogen degradation products to S. aureus and to beta-hemolytic streptococci group A, C and G.
AB  - Binding of fibrinogen degradation products was measured to Gram-positive cocci known to carry receptors for human fibrinogen. Forty-one strains of S. aureus and group A, C and G streptococci were studied. The largest plasmin produced fragment (X-fragment, HMWDP) showed higher binding levels to the bacterial receptors in all four species as compared to intact fibrinogens. The enzymatically produced C-terminal fragment D was strongly reactive, whereas the N-terminal fragment E was non-reactive. Inhibition experiments showed that reactive fragments were bound to the same receptors as fibrinogen. Three chemically-produced and well-characterized fragments from the terminal and the middle portions of the fibrinogen molecule were all negative in binding assays. The binding patterns for fibrinogen and the fragments tested were identical in the four bacterial species tested, S. aureus and group A, C and G streptococci. The results confirm and extend earlier data on similarities between fibrinogen receptors on these Gram-positive bacterial species.
TI  - Variation in Wisconsin Mastitis Test Scores of bucket milk samples and relationship to bacterial infections.
AB  - Sources of variation in the Wisconsin Mastitis Test were studied in 4739 bucket milk samples from 111 cows in one herd during 103 days. Quarters of cows were classified infected or uninfected through bacteriologic assays of quarter milk samples. Quarters were uninfected in 70.4% of the cow-quarter-days and infected with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in 1.4 and .9% of the quarter samples. Scores of all cow-days averaged 8.5. Wisconsin Mastitis Test scores of cow-days having no pathogens averaged 5.8. Correlation of duplicate samples was .97. Repeatability of monthly tests was .67. Days within month of lactation, month within age group, cow within age, and age differed. Older cows averaged higher Wisconsin Mastitis Test scores. Scores for uninfected cow-days did not differ with age. Scores were higher by 5.5 units in cows with infected quarters than in those with no infected quarters. The increase was greater with S. aureus or S. agalactiae present than with less virulent pathogens. In a cost-utility analysis, Wisconsin Mastitis Test was inefficient in detecting infected cows with a single test.
TI  - Lethal effect of CAMP-factor and UBERIS-factor--a new finding about diffusible exosubstances of streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - CAMP-factor, the exosubstance of Streptococcus agalactiae, and UBERIS-factor, the exosubstance of Streptococcus uberis, exerted lethal effect when administered parenterally to rabbits and white mice. A single intravenous dosis of 1,500 activity units per 1 kg body weight resulted in rapid death of the rabbits. To kill mice, the intravenous or intraperitoneal dosis had to be 45 times higher in relation to the body mass. After formaldehyde treatment, both streptococcal exosubstances were deprived of their lethal effect as well as of their synergistic hemolytic activity with the staphylococcal beta-toxin.

TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.
TI  - [Cefuroxime-tobramycin treatment of bacterial infections in cancer patients].
AB  - Twenty-five patients with different metastatic tumors, and often with other diseases which may have further compromised their defenses (such as diabetes, anemia and neutropenia), had a simultaneous bacterial complication. This was regarded as documented (i.e., proved by positive culture) in 12 of 25 patients, and probable if subjective and objective symptoms, X-ray, laboratory tests and the clinical picture agreed with bacterial infection in progress, even though the culture was negative, in 13 of 25 patients. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime-tobramycin gave good results in 19 of 25 patients, i.e., in 10 of 12 with a documented infection and in 9 of 13 with a probable infection. Fever of unknown origin and urinary infections were the most responsive to the therapy. Three of 25 patients had nephrotoxicity, with a very small rise in BUN and creatinine, which was easily reversible. According to our experience, antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime-tobramycin would be useful in cancer patients with bacterial complications because of its effectiveness and tolerability.
TI  - Use of a teat sealer for prevention of intramammary infections in lactating cows.
AB  - An acrylic latex film that is applied like a teat dip and remains intact as a physical barrier until the next milking was developed and studied with respect to its effect on intramammary infection rates in 4 dairy herds. Rates of new infections in treated quarters were compared with the rates in control quarters on the same cows. A statistically significant reduction in the rates was observed for the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, 28%; S epidermidis, 33%; and coliforms, 76%. The percentage reduction for infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (18%) and for those caused by streptococcus other than Str agalactiae (7%) were not statistically significant. The film also was shown to be nonirritating.
TI  - Rapid tube CAMP test for identification of Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield group B).
AB  - A rapid CAMP test for the presumptive identification of Streptococcus agalactiae  (Lancefield group B) is described. Sheep erythrocytes, sensitized by staphylococcal beta-lysin and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, were used to determine the lytic capacity of the neutralized supernatant fluids of 4-h broth cultures of streptococci being tested. A total of 96.2% of 130 group B streptococci gave positive CAMP tests, that is, lysis of the sheep erythrocytes after 10 min of exposure of streptococcal supernatants, whereas none of 381 non-group B streptococci tested produced any lysis. The test described provides presumptive identification of group B streptococci within 4 h and eliminates problems of intermediate reactions so that a positive test is indicative only of CAMP factor production.
TI  - Sensitivities to antibiotics and seasonal occurrence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - In a 2-yr survey of the Clemson University's dairy herd, each sample of mastitic  milk was cultured, and mastitis pathogens were isolated. Causative organisms then were subjected to disc assay of sensitivity to antibiotics. Antibiotics were penicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, cephalothin (cephalosporin), ampicillin and novobiocin. The more widely used antibiotics--penicillin, streptomycin, and erythromycin--were relatively ineffective for bacterial sensitivity in vitro, whereas bacterial sensitivity in vitro for oxytetracycline and cephalothin was considerably more. These results also were true in vivo in treatment of animals in the University herd. Incidence of mastitis under our conditions of weather, housing, and management increased greatly during summer months with less increase during winter months.
TI  - Studies on the growth-inhibiting property of amniotic fluids from two United States population groups.
AB  - This study attempted to determine if lack of antimicrobial activity in amniotic fluid is the reason United States blacks have more amniotic fluid bacterial infection than whites. No significant interracial differences were found in a study of 111 fluids from whites and 56 fluids from blacks. It has been claimed that the phosphate:zinc ratio in amniotic fluid is an accurate predictor of antimicrobial activity. The present study found this often to be untrue. Amniotic fluids that lacked antimicrobial activity gained such activity when zinc was added, but the in vitro zinc levels required were usually higher than observed physiologic concentrations. Previous studies have claimed that antimicrobial activity first appears in the amniotic fluid in the third trimester of gestation. We found such activity in the majority of fluids by the end of the first trimester, with a Staphylococcus aureus indicator; in contrast, with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae as test organisms, greater inhibition was observed after 35 weeks.

TI  - Culture-negative septic arthritis and bacterial endocarditis. Diagnosis by synovial biopsy.
AB  - The capacity of bacterial endocarditis to mimic other systemic illnesses is well  known. This report describes a patient with blood culture-negative bacterial endocarditis who presented with features suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. Despite sterile synovial fluid, synovial biopsy culture resulted in identification of the causative organism and led to specific antibiotic therapy and cure. This is the first report of such a case.
TI  - Transferability of macrolide, lincomycin, and streptogramin resistances between group A, B, and D streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The transferability of plasmid pRI405 between various streptococci of groups A, B, and D, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is described. pRI405 originated from Streptococcus faecalis and encodes for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance). The host range of the well-documented streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was found to be similar to that of pRI405. Cleavage with restriction enzymes suggests that pRI405 belongs to a related family of MLS resistance plasmids.

TI  - Biological significance of lysozyme-like substances in the milk of cows with the  mammary gland in physiological and pathological states.
AB  - The lysozyme activity in milk or exudate of 1028 cows, healthy or with various abnormal states of the mammary gland was determined in IU/ml. Normal milk from a healthy gland demonstrated a slight lysozyme activity-to 1,5 IU/ml. In exudate of a dry gland and in precolostral one the lysozymatic activity was distinct-to about 60 IU/ml. In latent infections the level of lysozyme was slightly higher than the normal. In various abnormal states of the mammary gland, there occurred a dependence between the level of the lysozyme activity and the number of nucleated cells and the virulence of bacteria. During treatment, as clinical changes subsided, the lysozyme activity in milk decreased gradually.

TI  - Diagnostic utilization of hemolytically active exosubstances of certain Gram-positive bacteria. II. Detection of staphylococcal hemolysins by means of a pre-purified hemolytically active exosubstance of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.
AB  - The use of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis or of its hemolytically active exosubstance for the detection of staphylococcal hemolysins represents a suitable alterative to the use of the beta-toxin producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus, or of isolated beta-toxin. An increased capture of beta-toxin production was recorded when the CAMP-factor of Streptococcus agalactiae was used. A total of 446 Staphylococcus aureus strains and 48 coagulase-negative staphylococal strains were tested against the prepurified form of hemolytically active exosubstance of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and against the CAMP-factor. The results obtained are in agreement with the testing by means of staphylococcal beta-toxin and of the CAMP-factor. The two modifications of the method for the detection of staphylococcal hemolysins using one plate as proposed by the authors give good results. Their ability of assessment, however, is higher by one degree when the exocubstance of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is employed.
TI  - Mastitis: II. Evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  - Recent proposals by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. Primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichi coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. Since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (N-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (N-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (N, N-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (N, N, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of S. agalactiae or E. coli on the bovine teat surface. The five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. Activity was greater against the gram-positive S. agalactiae than against the gram-negative E. coli. The tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. The relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. The results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation into teat dips.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of expressed breast milk.
AB  - In a study of breast milk collected into sterile bottles rinsed in 1% hypochlorite solution the hypochlorite solution adherent to the sides of the bottles apparently caused a large reduction in bacterial contamination of the milk after storage at 4 degrees C for up to four hours. Heating expressed breast milk at 62.5 degrees C for five minutes destroyed over 90% of the Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated into the milk samples. Rinsing collecting bottles with hypochlorite solution may be valuable in collecting milk with a low bacterial content for human-milk banks. Furthermore, the currently accepted pasteurisation time of 30 minutes may be excessive.
TI  - Posology and field efficacy study with novobiocin for intramammary infusion in nonlactating dairy cows.
AB  - Four dose levels of novobiocin (50, 200, 400, 600 mg) were compared with no drug  for the intramammary treatment of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and other streptococcal infections present in the udder of dairy cows at the initiation of the dry period. Treatment success was evaluated by comparing the microbiological status of duplicate pretreatment quarter milk samples collected at drying off with the microbiological status of duplicate quarter milk samples collected four to ten days postcalving. Infection status of 1318 cows in 75 herds in five geographic locations was determined. Treatment effects on infected cows were evaluated by least squares analysis of variance with treatment, herd, lactation number, days dry and milk production at drying off considered as variables. The dose of 400 mg novobiocin per quarter was demonstrated to be significantly more effective (P < 0.05) than no drug and significantly better than (P < 0.05) or equal to the other doses for curing infections caused by S. aureus, S. agalactiae and other streptococci. A significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the overall rate of new udder infections acquired during the dry period was observed in cows treated with >/= 200 mg novobiocin at drying off. The data supported the conclusion that the cow rather than the quarter is the appropriate experimental unit in the evaluation of intramammary mastitis treatments. Herd and lactation number were the most significant variables affecting cures.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  - Defective activation of the third component of complement in the sera of newborn  infants.
AB  - The activation of the terminal complement components, C3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. In the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (C3) in newborn serum was examined. A variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees C for 30 min and the percent of available C3 that was activated was measured. Using one strain of Escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available C3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (P less than 0.005). In contrast, using another strain of E. coli (N70), the percent of C3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). The defective activation of C3 in newborn sera by E. coli was not related to the presence of the K1 antigen. Newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of C3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. The defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - The prevalence of udder infection and mastitis in herds producing bulk milk with  either consistently high or low cell count.
AB  - Quarter samples from twenty-five dairy herds, representing 223 herds supplying direct to Brisbane, were cultured and submitted to the Wisconsin Mastitis Test (WMT). Thirteen herds had a history of producing bulk milk with a consistently high WMT score (greater than 15 mm) and in twelve herds the WMT score was consistently low. Prevalence of infection was higher in group A herds (22.2% quarters were infected with Staphylococcus aureus or streptococci) than in group B herds (9.8% of quarters were infected). There was considerable scatter of prevalence among both groups of herds. Overall, S. aureus was found in 19% of cows and 7% of quarters, and Streptococcus agalactiae in 15% of cows and 7% of quarters. Quarters from group A herds showed a higher WMT score than those in group B herds whether infected with S. aureus, Str. agalactiae, micrococci or yielded no detectable organisms. It was concluded that regular surveys are required of the high cell count herds to monitor mastitis status in the industry.

TI  - Neonatal septicemia and perinatal risk factors.
AB  - Many methods for screening and prediction of neonatal septicemia have been tried. In this study a score, related to both perinatal risk factors and neonatal diseases, was tested upon healthy newborn infants, infants with septicemia and infants with other diseases. Statistical differences were found between infants with neonatal septicemia and infants with other neonatal diseases as well as normal newborns. It was also possible to find a relationship between certain predisposing factors and predominance of certain pathogens. Complications during pregnancy and delivery were most often found in the group B streptococcal, combinations of invasive procedures and neonatal diseases in the staphylococcal group and surgical procedures in the gram-negative group.
TI  - [Microbial etiology of subclinical bovine mastitis in the Santa Fe dairy basin].
AB  - A study of 320 samples of mammary quarters from cows in 40 dairy farms around Santa Fe city during 1977-1978 was made. The samples were selected based on clinical examination and California Mastitis Test (GMT). High percentage of subclinical mastitis was found. The etiological agents most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (54,1%), Streptococcus agalactiae (23.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13,2%). A winter increment of S. aureus (48,1%) and P. aeruginosa (3,7% and 22,5%) was observed. But S. agalactiae did not experiment considerable variation (26,8% and 20% throughout the year. The sensitivity to antibiotics of some strains decreased in winter specially in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (61,5% and 38,9%), and some biochemical properties related with their virulence increased. Penicillin in milk was not detected, but the levels of contamination by non specific inhibitory substances were very high (40%). Besides it was found a great contamination with aerobic sporeforming bacteria in these samples, being Bacillus coagulans (59,1%), B. polymyxa (26,1%) and B. sphaericus (9,5%) the most frequent.
TI  - Mastitis: I. In vitro antimicrobial activity of alkyl amines against mastitic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause about 95% of bovine mastitis. Three gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. Sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. Alkyl secondary N-substituted monoethyl [CH3(CH2)nNHCH2CH3] and tertiary N,N-substituted dimethyl [CH3(CH2) nN(CH3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. The carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. Branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. Antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.
TI  - Bacteriological quality control in human milk-banking.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of pooled human milk donated to the Oxford milk bank  was analysed and the effects on bacteriology of sterilisation of the milk-collecting vessels in the home with hypochlorite solution and of Holder pasteurisation in a purpose-built human-milk pasteuriser were studied. Collecting milk in hypochlorite-sterilised vessels resulted in a significantly lower bacterial count of both pathogens and species of unlikely pathogenicity before pasteurisation and significantly increased the chance of pasteurisation giving a sterile product. Potentially pathogenic organisms grown in untreated milk were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Seven species of organisms of unlikely pathogenicity were also identified. Pasteurisation eliminated all potential pathogens from milk but did not reliably remove any of the species of unlikely pathogens. Banked human milk may be contaminated with bacteria which are known to be capable of producing lipases, proteases, and decarboxylases. Accurate pasteurisation, together with attention to the sterility of the collecting vessels, results in a bacteriologically safe product that retains many of the protective properties of raw milk.
TI  - Diagnostic utilization of hemolytically active exosubstances of certain gram-positive bacteria. I. Detection of staphylococcal hemolysins with prepurified preparations of staphylococcal beta-toxin and CAMP-factor of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The authors have modified the one-plate method for the detection of staphylococcal hemolysins. They recommend to use in this method a prepurified form of staphylococcal beta-toxin and of streptococcal CAMP-factor instead of the exclusively beta-tonin-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus and instead of the intensively CAMP-test positive Streptococcus agalactiae strain, respectively. The authors determined concurrently staphylococcal hemolysins, using a three-plate method in which alpha-antitoxin was employed, to ensure a better evidence of alpha-toxin. A total of 494 staphylococcal strains were examined by both methods. Of this number, 446 Staphylococcus aureus strains were of diverse host origin and 48 were coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains. On the basis of the various hemolytically active staphylococcal toxins, the authors recommend the suggested modification of the one-plate method for their routine detection.
TI  - [Finding of the staphyloccoi and streptococci of mastitis on the udder after various ways and means of cleaning].
AB  - The presence of mastitis staphylococci and streptococci on the udder's surface of 400 cows was studied following application of various ways and means of cleaning. The presence of agents causing mastitis was determined before and after cleaning the udder. On uncleaned udder surfaces presence of mastitis staphylococci was observed in 52.5% and of mastitis streptococci--39.5% of udders studied. After washing with water mastitis staphylococci--on 12-20% of the udders. Following udder cleaning with solutions of antigerm 50 (0.04%) or yozan CCT (4%), mastitis staphylococci were found on 4% and 6% of the udders, respectively, while mastitis staphylococci--on 2% and 6%, respectively. Udder surface staphylococci belong in 2.2% to II phagous group, in 46.6%--to the III group, and in 37.7% -- to mixed groups. The most frequently encountered phagous types were 6 and 42D.
TI  - Control of mastitis by hygiene and therapy.
AB  - Hygiene and therapy are two important components of a program to control mastitis. Conscientious application of these practices significantly reduces intramammary infection, especially when they are applied in concert with superior management. The two components operate independently, and response is maximum when both are applied. Hygiene acts by reducing the frequency of infection. The primary effect of therapy is to increase the rate of eliminating established infections, although dry cow treatment also provides prophylactic benefits. The most effective hygiene and therapy practices are dipping of teats after milking and treating each quarter at the end of lactation.
TI  - A simple method of detecting staphylococcal hemolysins.
AB  - A modification of the "one-plate method" for detection of staphylococcal hemolysins has been described. Bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Cornebacterium pseudotuberculosis were replaced by their prepurified hemolytically active exosubstances: beta-toxin, CAMP-factor, and, the exosubstance of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis called COREX. By means of the modification described, exact detection of hemolysins in possible with staphylococcal strains producing one type of hemolysin as well as with strains producing a combination of hemolysins.
TI  - Absence of bacterial adherence in the establishment of experimental mastitis in mice.
AB  - The possibility of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae to the epithelium of the mammary gland was investigated by inoculating them into this gland of mice. S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli did not adhere to alveolar epithelium in suckling or non-suckling mice. S. agalactiae adhered to alveolar epithelium in non-suckling mice but adhesion was not sufficiently strong to withstand suckling. Bacterial adherence probably does not play a significant role in the establishment of mastitis by these organisms.

TI  - Synergistic hemolysis phenomenon shown by an alpha-toxin-producing Clostridium perfingens and streptococcal CAMP factor in presumptive streptococcal grouping.
AB  - A new phenomenon of synergistic hemolysis by Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  and the streptococcal CAMP factor on human and guinea pig erythrocytes is described. A possible mode of action of the CAMP factors is suggested. On human blood agar all of the tested isolates of group B streptococci gave an arrowhead-shaped zone of hemolysis; 74% of group A gave a crescent-shaped lytic zone, whereas all isolates of groups C and G and the remaining 26% of group A streptococci gave a bullet-shaped lytic zone. By comparison, in the CAMP test incubated aerobically and anaerobically, 70 and 91%, respectively, of streptococci other than group B gave positive, arrowhead-shaped lytic zones. If all intermediate positive reactions in the CAMP tests were read as negative after aerobic incubation, only 89% of group B streptococci would be properly identified. The synergistic hemolysis phenomenon, using an alpha-toxin-producing C. perfringens and human blood agar, provided a reliable test for presumptive identification of group B streptococci, with promising potential to differentiate in the same test group A streptococci from other groups.
TI  - Electron capture gas-liquid chromatographic study of metabolites produced by some arthritic transudate-associated organisms in vitro and in vivo in rabbit models.
AB  - Computerized, frequency-pulsed, modulated electron capture gas-liquid chromatography was used to study the acid metabolites produced in vitro in fetal calf serum and in vivo in an animal chamber model. Several strains of Diplostreptococcus agalactiae, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus serogroups A, B, and G were studied. All of these organisms have been reported to be associated with arthritic transudates in humans. Metabolites were detected by this method from derivatized extracts of both spent fetal calf serum and chamber fluids. Since there was little host response to the organisms cultured in the chambers, it is highly probable that the products detected represent metabolites produced in an in vivo type of environment. The metabolic patterns were reproducible and exhibited many similarities in vitro and in vivo. Production of the acids detected was reproducible, and these acids were useful identification markers. The data support published reports (J. B. Brooks, C. C. Alley, and J. A. Liddle, Anal. Chem. 46: 1930-1934, 1974; J. B. Brooks, G. Choudhary, R. B. Craven, D. Edman, C. C. Alley, and J. A. Liddle, J.

Dis. 129:660-668, 1974) that bacterial metabolites might be detectable in diseased body fluids. The growth characteristics of the organisms in the animal model and fetal calf serum are discussed, and a moderately priced computer for performing data manipulations is evaluated.
TI  - An etiologic shift in infantile osteomyelitis: the emergence of the group B streptococcus.
AB  - Twenty-one infants from six to 52 days of age (mean 23.3 days) with osteomyelitis were studied between 1965 and 1977. The etiologic agents were group B streptococcus (8), staphylococcus aureus (6), gramnegative bacilli (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), and unknown (2). Patients with group B streptococcal osteomyelitis were characterized by an uncomplicated neonatal course, single bone involvement with a predilection for involvement of the proximal humerus, and lack of inflammatory signs. In contrast, patients with osteomyelitis due to other organisms frequently had had manipulative procedures predisposing to infection and were more likely to have multiple bone involvement, fever, and leukocytosis at the time of diagnosis. Functional impairment was detected in only one of 17 patients evaluated a mean of 36 months after diagnosis.
TI  - Complete versus selective dry cow therapy for mastitis control.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty-two cows were assigned alternately to complete dry cow therapy (infusion in all quarters on the day of drying off) or selective therapy (infusion in all quarters if a history of mastitis, California Mastitis Test score of +2 or +3 in any quarter, or if cell counts from bucket milk samples as determined by the membrane filter-deoxyribonucleic acid procedure were above 500,000 cells/ml). A dry cow product containing 10(6) units of procaine penicillin G and 1 g of dihydrostreptomycin in a slow release base was used. A 1% iodophor teat dip was used throughout the experiment. Infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococci, and gram negative rods were eliminated from 85.4% of the infected quarters with complete therapy and 88.2% of the infected quarters with selective therapy. New infections occurred in 3.1% of quarters with complete therapy and in 6.5% of the quarters with selective therapy. Incidence of mastitis following the dry period was less with complete therapy compared to selective therapy (4.6% vs. 7.8% of the quarters). Selective therapy was as effective as complete therapy in eliminating existing infections. Complete therapy would be the choice in situations where new infections in dry period are of concern.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  - Five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. The causative microorganisms were Streptococcus bovis, S faecalis, S agalactiae, S intermedius, and Staphylococcus aureus. Except for the strain of S faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. To insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by S faecalis. There was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. Vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. Vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Influence of phenylbutazone on leukocyte chemiluminescence and function.
AB  - The effect of phenylbutazone on human leukocyte chemiluminescence, phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria has been examined. A marked reduction of chemiluminescence and intracellular killing of bacteria was observed. The effect on phagocytosis was less pronounced. High drug concentrations nearly abolished light emission, and concentrations equivalent to those obtained in plasma during therapy caused a 25--30% reduction. The effect occurred within less than 10 minutes. No permanent effect upon resting cells was observed. Phenylbutazone reduced the effect of sodium azide on leukocyte chemiluminescnece, indicating that the drug might also inhibit myeloperoxidase dependent chemiluminescnece. Whether these impairments of leukocyte function also take place in vivo resulting in enhanced susceptibility to infection remains unknown.
TI  - Synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of Propionibacterium acnes. P. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on Tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase C-precipitated egg yolk agar. Such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. Similar reactions were attempted with Lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. The synergistic reactions, between P. acnes and C. perfringens, were compared with The classical CAMP reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. Synergistic reactions observed do seem to reflect the membrane composition. Such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. Detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria, may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.
TI  - Evaluation of the counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure in a clinical laboratory setting.
AB  - The counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. The procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. An inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the CIE procedure at bench level. Results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in detecting Haemophilus influenzae, type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group B. The procedure was more sensitive for detection of H. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group B. The authors have confirmed the usefulness of the CIE procedure in the detection of group B streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to Staphylococcus aureus. Detection of Escherichia coli K 1 antigen was also accomplished by CIE. In the authors' laboratory the CIE procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of H. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group B.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. VI. Comparative efficacy of a teat dip under experimental and natural exposure to mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Efficacies (reduction of new intramammary infections) of a bronopol teat dip under experimental exposure to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus were 41.7 and 54.4%. Under natural exposure, efficacy was 35.0% (P greater than .05) against Streptococcus species and 50.0% against Staphylococcus aureus during the first 9 mo of a 12-mo trial when favorable milking equipment and labor conditions prevailed. Corresponding figures were 20.0 and 13.0% during the last 3 mo following onset of malfunctioning equipment and deterioration of labor services.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. V. Efficacy of teat dips under experimental exposure to mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Efficacy (reduction of new intramammary infections) was determined against Staphylococcus aureus in 14 trials and against Streptococcus agalactiae in 5 trials. Against Staphylococcus aureus seven 1% iodophor products had an average efficacy of 89.9% while three .5% iodophor products averaged 76.4%. A solution of sodium dichloro-s-triazenetrione reduced infections 79.0% and 2% dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid was 50.4% effective. Efficacies of two quaternary ammonium products at .18 and .5% were 84.8 and 60.9%. A placebo vehicle and .15 M saline as teat dips reduced infections 8.9 and 9.2%. Infection rates with Streptococcus agalactiae were low; efficacy ranged from 50.5 to 100.0%, average 65.6%. The model of experimental exposure provided a better estimate of effectiveness of a teat dip than would be possible under conditions of most commercial dairying.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. IV. Evaluation of teat dips with excised cows' teats.
AB  - Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to contaminate teats excised from cows. Commercially available teat dips were applied for evaluation of comparative germicidal activity. Iodophors, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium dichloro-s-triazenetrione were highly effective against all four test organisms. Quarternary ammonium, chlorhexidine, and cetylpyridinium chloride were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae but not Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bronopol and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate were marginally effective on the two Gram positive organisms and ineffective on the two Gram negatives. Three of the dips were ineffective against all four pathogens; two were in nonaqueous bases, and the other was a blend of pine oil and antibodies with udder origin. In other trials, iodophor at .3% titratable iodine was highly effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Products containing .5 and 1% iodophor maintained effectiveness after each was used to dip 140 teats under conditions of commercial dairying. Logarithmic reduction in the geometric mean number of organisms recovered from teats was more meaningful for evaluating data than percent reduction.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Sensitivity to miconazole of micro-organisms associated with angular cheilitis.
AB  
TI  - Method for rapid detection of group B streptococci by coagglutination.
AB  - A quick and reliable technique for the identification of group B streptococci has been developed. The method requires no elaborate equipment or expensive reagents and can be used to detect the group B organisms in mixed broth cultures or to identify suspect colonies selected from agar plates. The method is a coagglutination technique in which 1 drop of specifically sensitized protein A-containing Staphylococcus aureus is mixed with 1 drop of supernatant of an actively growing culture. The soluble group-specific carbohydrate substance of the group B streptococci reacts with the staph particles to produce agglutination that is macroscopically readable. One colony of group B streptococci taken from an agar plate and inoculated into Todd-Hewitt broth will give a positive reaction within 6 h of incubation; with a larger inoculum, the positive reaction occurs within a shorter period. The method was applied for detection of group B streptococci in mixed broth cultures. In laboratory studies involving random mixtures of organisms, 59.3% of positive cultures were detected within the first 8 h of incubation, and 71.7% were found within 24 h. In clinical studies with mixed broth cultures grown directly from vaginal swabs, 78.6% of the positive cultures were detected within the first 8 h of incubation, and 92.9% were found within 24 h.
TI  - Change in udder health and overmilking.
AB  - Removing milker units as soon as milk flow stopped was compared to milking for a  fixed time of 12 min in an 8-wk trial with 60 cows. Teats were dipped in broth culture of approximately 10(9) colony forming units per ml of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis for 4 wk. More new infections of quarters occurred in the 12-min group. In trials 2 and 3, 20 additional cows were milked with automatic milking machine detachers and 20 cows were milked with a flow control unit for 12 min each trial. New infection rates were highest in the two groups milked for 12 min. Age for lactation and cows were associated with most of the variation in the new infection rate. Cows with pointed teat ends had the highest rate of new infection. Effects of fixed-time milking on increased mammary infection and clinical mastitis were small.
TI  - Apparatus for pasteurising teat cup liners between cows in a herringbone parlour.
AB  - In a herringbone milking parlour, teat cup liners were deliberately contaminated  in turn with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Sterp uberis. Contamination was achieved by filling the liners with milk that contained 10(6) test organisms per ml. After the clusters had been back-flushed with water at 85 degrees C for five seconds, normal swabbing methods failed to recover any contaminating organisms from the teat liners in 56 tests out of 64. After 10 seconds back-flushing no recoveries were made in the same number of tests. The apparatus developed to effect this back-flushing for a particular herringbone parlour is described, with details of its routine use during milking. For a 100-cow herd, the running cost of such equipment using a five-second back-flush is estimated at no more than 4 pounds per week and, in its present form, would not add more than 10 seconds to the total milking time for each cow. Improvements in design of the apparatus, and in milking techniques arising from the routine use of the device, are also considered.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - The New South Wales mastitis control program. 2. Effect upon bacterial infections.
AB  - Bacteriological examinations were made on quarter samples from cows in 35 herds over a 3 year period to monitor the response in a mastitis control program. Initially, Staphylococcus aureus predominated in 32 of the herds and the mean herd prevalence was 26%. The control measures halved this rate but there was considerable variation in response between herds. The decline occurred rapidly and there was a significant reduction (P less than 0.01) by 3 months. Streptococcus agalactiae predominated in 3 herds and the overall infection rate was 4.9%. Control measures eliminated the infection completely from most herds but reinfection occurred in 2 herds. The greatest decline occurred in the first 6 months and was significant (P less than 0.05). The measures had little effect upon Str. uberis and Str. dysgalactiae which remained fairly consistently at low levels. Initially, strains of Staph. aureus resistant to penicillin were dominant in most herds. In a minority of herds strains resistant to streptomycin predominated and in these herds there was a concurrent resistance to penicillin. These patterns did not change greatly over the control period. Resistance by Str. agalactiae to streptomycin occurred in most herds at the start of the program.
TI  - [Selective effect of propolis in the isolation of Listeria monocytogenes (author's transl)].
AB  - Propolis is a substance produced by honeybees. It is inhibitory to some bacteria  species, mainly Gram-positive bacteria, but less inhibitory to Listeria monocytogenes (L.m) than to the other Gram-positive bacteria tested. In order to obtain selective growth of L.m. from contaminated samples, the effect of propolis in plating media and broths on various strains of bacteria was examined. Table I shows the effect of increasing concentrations of propolis in tryptose-agar (TA). L.m. tolerated higher concentrations of propolis than Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus. L.m. grew well in tryptosebroth (TB) that contained 0.15 mg propolis pr. ml medium, while Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus agalactiae were completely inhibited as seen in Table II. Table III shows that when serum was added to the agar, the inhibitory effect was reduced. It can also be seen that Gram-negative bacteria grew quite well on media that contained 0.19 mg propolis pr. ml. To reduce the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, nalidixic acid was added to the medium. Table IV illustrates growth of various species of bacteria in tryptosephosphatebroth (TFB) with or without propolis and nalidixic acid. Most of the strains tested were inhibited, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to some extent faecal streptococci were able to grow in the medium that contained the selective substances. As a conclusion it seems that propolis may be a valuable additive to a medium for the selective isolation of L.m.
TI  - Intramammary infections in a dairy herd with a low incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - In a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. During the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. Among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. Among new infections, 41.6% occurred during the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. Incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. Among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by Escherichia coli, and 23.8% by Enterobacter spp. Among the many serotypes of K pneumoniae and E coli, none was predominant.
TI  - Rapid slide coagglutination test for identifying and typing group B streptococci.
AB  - A Cowan I strain of Staphylococcus aureus was labeled with either group B streptococcal grouping or typing antiserum. These antibody-labeled reagent cells (ARC) were used in a slide coagglutination test to identify and type group B streptococci from blood agar plates. All streptococci were also identified by the standard Lancefield capillary precipitin test. In a blind study, all 141 group B streptococci were correctly identified by the coagglutination grouping test. None of the 148 non-group B streptococci caused agglutination of ARC. The coagglutination grouping test required an acid extract prepared from only four colonies and could be completed less than 30 min after colonies were removed from plates. The coagglutination typing test correctly identified 98.6% of the types of the 141 group B streptococcal strains tested. At least 88.6% of these streptococci could be typed directly from blood agar plates within 5 min by the coagglutination typing test. The remaining 11.4% of the group B streptococci were acid extracted (less than a 30-min procedure), and the extract was used for coagglutination typing. Coagglutination typing can be performed with only four colonies. The coagglutination grouping and typing tests are inexpensive, rapid, reliable, and easy to perform.
TI  - Natural history of neonatal colonization with group B streptococci.
AB  - Thirteen percent of the newborns in our study group were colonized with group B streptococci on day 3. This colonization rate appeared constant during the first two weeks of life and then decreased to 5%. Of the babies colonized on day 3, 59% and 91% were culture-negative on days 14 and 42, respectively. Sixty-five percent of the babies carrying group B streptococci on day 14 acquired this microorganism following discharge (day 3). Babies colonized with staphylococci or Escherichia coli were found to have decreased probability of colonization with group B streptococci.
TI  - Culture and treatment results in endometritis following elective abortion.
AB  - Endometrial culture and treatment results from 228 patients who developed endometritis following elective abortion were analyzed. The most common organisms isolated were group B beta hemolytic streptococci, Bacteroides, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. In general, patients responded to treatment with penicillin or ampicillin, with the addition of an aminoglycoside for these requiring hospitalization. Curettage was an important adjunctive treatment for hospitalized patients and for some outpatients.
TI  - Prevalence of bovine subclinical mastitis in Malawi.
AB  - A survey comprising 934 cows of a total of 1180 from 22 dairy herds and the examination of bulk milk samples from 273 small-holders was carried out. At the time of sampling all known dairy herds and small-holders in Malawi were examined. Since relative few infections other than Staph. aureus and Str. agalactiae were revealed in the first 12 herds where quartermilk samples were taken composite milk samples (all four quarters into one sample) were taken in the remainder of the herds. The results of the survey are shown in Tables I a, b, c and II a and b. The major problems were infections caused by Str. agalactiae and Staph. aureus. The amount of pathological secretion was low compared to countries with a developed dairy industry such as Denmark.
TI  - CAMP-disk test for presumptive identification of group B streptococci.
AB  - The modification of the CAMP test for goup B streptococci involved substituting a paper disk impregnated with partially purified beta-hemolysin for the staphylococcal culture that was the source of beta-hemolysin in the original test. The disk is placed onto a sheep blood agar plate beside the streak of Streptococcus being tested. The plate is then incubated aerobically at 35 degrees C. A positive reaction consists of a lunar-shaped clear zone that appears within 24 h in the dark beta-hemolysin zone surrounding the disk. A double-blind study of 135 randomly coded streptococcal isolates showed complete agreement between the CAMP-disk test and the standard Lancefield precipitin test. All group B streptococci tested had positive reactions, and all strains tested from streptococcal groups A, C, D, and G were negative. The CAMP-disk test is a simple and convenient way to identify presumptively group B streptococci.
TI  - Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and culture bacteria from the lower respiratory.
AB  - Forty-five specimens were obtained by sequential translaryngeal aspiration and fiberoptic bronchoscopy from 31 clinically unifected patients with lung cancer in order to evaluate the reliability of routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy for culture of the lower respiratory tract. Bacteria were recovered brom 98 percent (44) of the specimens obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy and from 58 percent (26) of the specimens obtained by the preceding translaryngeal aspiration. The microorganisms grown from cultures of specimens obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy consisted of mixtures of both nonpathogenic and potenitally pathogenic bacteria. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were present in 87 percent (39) of the specimens from fiberoptic bronchoscopy and 31 percent (14) of specimens from translayngeal aspiration. The results of cultures from the two procedures agreed completely in only a single instance. Culture of washings or secretions obtained by routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not recommended because it provides inaccurate and clinically confusing information about the presence or types of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract prior to instrumentation.

TI  - Accentuation of Staphylococcal hemolysis (CAMP-like test) by pneumococci.
AB  - A CAMP-like phenomenon can be observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is supposed to be caused likewise as in group B streptococci by a haemolysis accentuating factor. However, the form of the accentuated haemolysis is different from that in group B streptococci and similar to that in listeria.
TI  - Rapid identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing of bacteria isolated from clinical infections.
AB  - A total of 834 bacterial strains isolated from urine were subjected to rapid biochemical and serological identification and rapid antimicrobial sensitivity testing using Autobac 1. For enterobacteria (742 strains) six tests (acetoin-, beta-galactosidase-, hydrogensulphide-, indole-, ornithin-decarboxylase-and urease-production) correctly identified to genus or species level more than 99% of the strains within four hours. Staphylococci and streptococci (92 strains) were identified with full accuracy within two hours using a rapid deoxyribonuclease assay and immunoelectroosmophoresis and coagglutination. The overall accuracy for the automated antibiotic susceptibility testing using Autobac was 93% as compared to the standard plate diffusion method. In terms of rapidity for 91% of the bacterial strains the susceptibility testing was completed within four hours. After five hours 99% of the strains were analysed. Our data indicate that rapid and automated assays can be accurate and furnish the physician with adequate data within 24 hours after receipt of a urinary specimen.

TI  - Neonatal sepsis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, 1969-1975: bacterial isolates and  clinical correlates.
AB  - The experience with neonatal sepsis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital during 1969-1975 was reviewed. Major pathogens included Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, other streptococci, and Klebsiella. Nineteen percent of coliform isolates were kanamycin-resistant. The frequency of recovery of E. coli was increased in early-onset sepsis, and the frequency of recovery of Klebsiella was increased in late-onset sepsis. The mortality rate was 23%. The frequency of recovery of E. coli was increased in fatal cases, and mortality was highly correlated with the presence of gastrointestinal catastrophe. Ampicillin and gentamicin are the initial antibiotics of choice for neonatal sepsis at this institution; a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be added when Staphylococcus aureus involvement is likely, and addition of chloramphenicol or clindamycin should be considered for infants at increased risk for Bacteroides fragilis sepsis.
TI  - [Occurrence and etiology for subclinical mastitis in cows].
AB  - Studied were a total of 16,571 cows on 89 farms by means of the Bernburg test. Milk was sampled from the positively reacting quarters of the udder by taking 18,047 samples intended for bacteriologic investigation. The demonstration of mastitis streptococci was carried out on "TKT" agar Merk, of pathogenic staphylococci, hemolytic streptococci, and Corinebacteria--on dextrose agar Oxoid containing 7.5% citrated calf blood. The isolated hemolytic streptococcus bacteria from the two nutrient media were differentiated through the CAMP test as well as serologically by the precipitation agar gel and Difco sera. The pathogenicity of Staphylococcus bacteria, in addition through hemolysis, was tested by the use of plasma coagulase with citrated rabbit plasma. In 53.95% of the cases there were secretory lesions due to Sc. agalactiae (6.23%) to Sc. dysgalactiae (5.69%) to Sc. uberis (8.47%), to Staph. aureus (2.44%), to hemolytic streptococci of the C, G and L groups (0.28%), to Sc. viridans (0.03%), to Corynebacterium pyogenes (0.41%), and catarrhal mastitis (30.4%). Some of the causative agents, such as Sc. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and others have proved of epidemiologic importance to humans.
TI  - Effect of amniotic fluid on bacterial growth.
AB  - The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was studied using four pathogenic organisms which are encountered in the perinatal period, E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and Group B beta hemolytic streptococci. Amniotic fluid inhibited the growth of all four organisms, with a wide degree of individual variation among specimens. The greatest degree of inhibition was noted for L. monocytogenes and the least for E. coli. The time in gestation in which the amniotic fluid sample was obtained did not appear to be related to its bacteriostatic capacity. The ability of amniotic fluid to inhibit the growth of certain pathogenic organisms may be significant in prevention of perinatal infection.

TI  - [Comparative studies of methods for the bacteriological diagnosis of mastitis in  cows].
AB  - Comparative studies were carried out on some methods and nutrient media used for  the isolation and identification of mastitis causative agents. Milk from normal andmastitis-affected udder quarters was aseptically sampled and treated under various conditions. Individual samples were simultaneously seeded in different media. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Milk samples for the diagnosis of mastitis of a subclinical character can be taken at the beginning and at the end of milking. 2. Direct seedings of milk have equal diagnostic value as those of the sediment. With the former the process of bacteriologic treatment of the samples is shortened in time, and the isolation and differentiation of the mastitis agents is rendered feasible. 3. At the present etiologic structure of the subclinical types of mastitis in this country most suitable has proved the blood agar medium in which almost all mastitis causative agents can be demonstrated. 4. Kartashova's medium and the TKT-medium possess a pronounced selectivity with special reference to streptococci and have higher diagnostic value for farms where streptococcus mastitis is prevailing.
TI  - [Hibitan and Iosan SST in the prevention of subclinical mastitis in cows].
AB  - The effect was tested of the disinfection preparations hibitan and iozan SST under field conditions in the course of six months. The animals treated were included in two groups: group I--with 20 cows, and group II--with 39 cows. All animals were free of mastitis-causing agents. The udder of the animals in the first was disinfected with hibitan-super-concentrate (7.5 per cent chlorhexidin gluconate). Prior to milking the udder was washed with a 0.12 per cent solution. After milking the teats were disinfected with a hibitan cream. The udder of the animals of the second group was disinfected with iozan SST (17.6 per cent tensit-iodo-iodide complex). Prior to milking the udder was washed a 0.5 per cent solution, and the teats after milking were disinfected with a 33 per cent iozan SST solution. It was found that the washing of the udder and teats as indicated above in the course of 6 months rules out the outbreak of the infectious subclinical mastitits in cows. It is suggested to adopt the use of the two preparations to prevent mastitis in field and farm practice.
TI  - Some factors affecting selective adherence of microorganisms in the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Some parameters affecting the adherence of microbes to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland were studied. Adherence increased from teat sinus to lactiferous sinus to the large ducts, and cells from the lactiferous sinus to the large ducts, and cells from the lactiferous sinus were used for all other experiments. There was no difference in adherence to cells from different quarters of the same cow, but there were significant differences between cows. Scanning electron microscopy suggested that the cells of the ductular epithelium undergo dynamic changes that probably result in secretion and/or desquamation. Adherence to cells could be demonstrated only at a late stage of these changes. The adherence of organisms associated with mastitis was studied using an in vitro test. Adherence generally paralleled prevalence as cause of disease, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae adhering best. Strain variation suggested that virulence was related to adherence with S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae but not with S. aureus. It is proposed that specific adherence is an important aspect of pathogenesis of mastitis due to S. aureus and S. agalactiae.
TI  - Bacteriostatic activity in cow's milk from udders infected with Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Milk samples from infected udders contained more lactoperoxidase and more thiocyanate than before infection. Irritation of 10 quarters of 5 cows caused the increase in the bacteriostatic activity of milk. Bacteriostatic activity of milk from the udders infected with staphylococci dropped after several weeks of chronic mastitis.
TI  - [Sensitivity of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus strains to antibiotics in Slovia during 1975].
AB  - The sensibility of 3100 Streptococcus agalactiae strains and 600 Staphylococcus aureus strains to antibiotics was examined in 1975 in the veterinary institute of the Slovak Socialist Republic by the plate diffusion test. The strains were collected from the dairy cow's milk samples. Of the Streptococcus agalactiae strains there were sensible 100% to ampicillin, 99.06% to chloramphenicol, 98.13% to erythromycin, 96.12% to oxytetracycline, 91.11% to bacitracin, 58.12% to penicillin, 23.92% to neomycin, 17.78% to streptomycin. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains there were sensible 97.48% to erythromycin, 97.14% to chloramphenicol, 95.15% to ampicillin, 94.81% to bacitracin, 93.26% to oxytetracycline, 92.49% to neomycin, 85.37% to streptomycin and 46.02% to penicillin. The results are being more thoroughly analysed and compared in the dicussion.
TI  - [Etiology of mastitidos in dairy cows in Slovakia during 1975].
AB  - In 1975, in the veterinary institutes in Slovakia bacteriological examinations of 54824 samples of milk coming from 28737 dairy cows were performed. Bacterial germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 18.91% of cows. These were: Streptococcus agalactiae (in 13.93% of cows), Staphylococcus aureus (2.86%), other streptococci (1.32%), E. coli (0.13%), Klebsiella sp. (0.13%), Corynebacterium pyogenes (0.15%), other bacterial germs (0.39%). Streptococci and staphylococci, taken together, represented 95.83% of all bacterial germs, Streptococcus agalactiae representing 73.72%. In comparison with the situation existing in 1974, a drop was found in the occurrence rate of the germs of Streptococcus agalactiae (by 2.94%) and Staphylococcus aureus (by 1.16%).
TI  - Nonlactating-cow therapy with a formulation of penicillin and novobiocin: therapeutic and prophylactic effects.
AB  - An experimental product incorporating 500,000 IU of procaine penicillin G and 600 mg of sodium novobiocin in 2% aluminum monostearate-peanut oil gel (10-ml dose) was used to treat all quarters of 56 cows which were infected in at least 1 quarter at time of final mild-out at end of lactation. Treatment was withheld from 89 cows uninfected in all quarters. Quarter infection was determined by bacteriologic culturing of milk samples collected at the last regular milking, at intervals up to final milk-out (7 or 12 days later), at calving, and 1 week later. Clearance rates against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, and coliform bacteria in treated quarters were 83, 94, 88, and 71%, respectively. Subtraction of the spontaneous clearance rate of about 50% in untreated quarters resulted in values of 35 to 45% for drug efficacy against existing staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. Prophylactic efficacy was examined. In cows entering the true nonlactating period with 1 or more quarters infected, new infection rates across the period aming quarters uninfected at the beginning were 36.0% among untreated cows and 6.3% among treated cows (P less than 0.005). The comparable rates for cows entering the nonlactating period uninfected in all quarters were 5.7 and 0%. Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, which comprised 38.5% of new period infections among untreated cows, were completely lacking among treated cows (P less than 0.025). Within the treated group of cows, 83.1% of infected quarters were cleared, and new infection rate in the non-lactating period was 50% less than the rate among untreated cows. Because the frequency of intramammary infection in this herd was quite low at "drying-off" (10.5% of quarters), the net effect on herd health of selective therapy of cows infected at end of lactation was a reduction in total quarter infection from 19.8 to 13.6%.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Machine milking: experimental observations on the life of teat-cup liners.
AB  - The useful life of neoprene teat-cup liners used in milking machines was determined by physico-mechanical, optical and microbiological studies. The various tests showed that after more than 1,000 hrs' use, that is the milking time plus disinfection time, there were physico-mechanical and biological changes that could have an adverse effect on the health of the udder as a result of a loss of elasticity and a dissemination of mastitis-producing microorganisms (S. agalactiae, S. aureus) which settle in cracks in the surface of the rubber.
TI  - Conversion of chronic staphylococcal mastitis to acute gangrenous mastitis after  neutropenia in blood and bone marrow produced by an equine anti-bovine leukocyte serum.
AB  - A stock strain of Staphylococcus aureus of mastitis origin, characterized by alpha-, beta-, and delta-toxins, was used to produce chronic mastitis of 20 to 300 days' duration in 6 lactating mammary quarters of 4 cows. Early acute Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis was produced in 1 additional mammary quarter of 1 cow. Equine anti-bovine leukocyte serum (EABLS) was administered to all cows by continuous intravascular drip for 12 to 32 hours. Neutropenia in blood and partial depletion of neutrophil reserve in bone marrow were produced. Chronic subclinical staphylococcal mastitis in 2 quarters of 1 cow changed to gangrenous mastitis by the 40th hour after EABLS administration and led to death of the cow. The disappearance of neutrophil leukocytes from the milk was followed by uninhibited multiplication of S aureus. Probably, staphylococcal leukocidins accelerated the destruction of neutrophils in the milk as S aureus multiplication became intensified. In another quarter of the same cow that was infected with Str agalactiae, neutrophil leukocytes were present in milk as long as 3 days after their disappearance from blood and bone marrow. This may give some indication of the extravascular life-span of the neutrophil in the udder in mastitis. The 2nd cow died at the 16th hour from the start of EABLS administration and at a time when gangrenous mastitis was in the initial stages of development. The S aureus-infected quarters of the 2 remaining cows did not become gangrenous. Administration of EABLS to these 2 cows did not significantly reduce the numbers of neutrophil leukocytes entering the milk of the 3 S aureus-infected quarters. It is concluded that continuous diapedesis of neutrophil leukocytes into the milk in chronic staphylococcal mastitis protects the gland against the development of gangrenous mastitis in the presence of a strain of S aureus capable of alpha-toxin production.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - [Inspection of the bovine udder (author's transl)].
AB  - Cell counts were made once and the presence or absence of Str. agalactiae, Str. uberis, Str. dysgalactiae and St. aureus were determined once in all quarter samples on seventeen normal dairy farms. Of 1,416 quarters studied, 347 (24.5%) showed a cell count of greater than 500,000/ml. and, of 354 udders examined, 202 (57.1%) showed a cell count of greater than 500,000/ml. The total number of quarters infected with pathogenic agents was 287 (20.3%), the number of infected udders being 159 (48.3%). The findings reported by the present author should also be taken into account in the recent discussion of the question whether the udders of lactating cattle intended for slaughter should be systematically condemned or, at any rate, should only be designed for human consumption after having been passed.
TI  - Cytologic features of bone marrow in normal and mastitic cows.
AB  - Rib bone marrow was aspirated from normal cows and from cows with experimentally  induced or naturally acquired mastitis. Nucleated cell counts in marrow films were made on the basis of differentiation of 500 cells. The myeloid/erythroid ratio was less than 1.0 in normal cows and generally greater than 1.0 in mastitic cows. The marrow reserve of mature neutrophils was nearly depleted in response to experimentally induced Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis (4th postinoculation day) or in an acute flare-up of naturally acquired Str agalactiae mastitis. A dose of 0.05 mg of Escherichia coli endotoxin, introduced into a single, normal, lactating quarter produced similar results within 8 hours. Concurrently, with depletion of marrow reserves of mature neutrophils, a neutropenia with left shift developed in the blood, and immature granulocytes increased in the marrow. The intensification of granulopoiesis returned the marrow reserves to normal or above normal within a period of 4 to 5 days, thereby reestablishing homeostasis.
TI  - [Resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  - The present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. Schematically it can outlined as follows. Streptococcus B-haemolyticus as well as Pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. Streptococcus viridans, Enterococcus and H. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. Due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci is now resistant to penicillin. In addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. The resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. The introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. However, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. On the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. Incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. Emergence of Pseudomonas, Proteus, Serratia, Providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to antibiotics. Carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.

TI  - Sodium cloxacillin for treatment of mastitis in lactating cows.
AB  - Sodium cloxacillin was used to treat 107 cows affected with acute mastitis and 138 affected with subclinical mastitis. Based on the application of conservative bacteriologic criteria, the cure rate was 53% for acute staphylococci mastitis and 65% for subclinical staphylococci mastitis. The cure rate for Streptococcus agalactiae infections was 91% in acute conditions and 92% in subclinical conditions. The cure rate was 73% for the acute infections and 88% in cases of subclinical infections when Streptococcus spp. "non ag" was the cause. Daily milk production had no effect on response rate. No adverse reactions due to treatment were reported by any investigator.
TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
TI  - Radiographic method for anatomic study of the teat canal: characteristics related to resistance to new intramammary infection during lactation and the early dry period.
AB  - An in vivo radiographic method to determine teat canal anatomy has shown that resistant quarters had teat canals with a smaller diameter than that of susceptible quarters. The length of the teat canal did not appear to be related to resistance to new intramammary infections. These findings relate to new infection caused by Aerobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Quarters guarded by teat canals with larger diameter were less resistent to new infection during both lactation and the early dry period compared with quarters guarded by teat canals with small diameter.
TI  - [Activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the milk serum of dairy cows in relation to the possitive response to the mastitis NK-test].
AB  - The level of total lactate dehydrogenase activity in dairy cow milk serum was studied in sets of quarter-udder milks showing different degrees of a positive response to Mastitis test-NK. The bacteriological examination for Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and for coliform germs was performed at the same time. Increasing positiveness of the response to Mastitis test-NK was found to be accompanied by an almost proportionate increase of the total lactate dehydrogenase activity level in milk serum. The bacteriological finding was not correlated with increasing positiveness of the response to Mastitis test-NK. New aspects of various diseases of the mammary gland and the possibility to diagnose mainly the latent stages of these diseases are analysed in a discussion.
TI  - [Etiology of mastitis in dairy cows in Slovakia during 1972-1974].
AB  - In the period from 1972 to 1974, veterinary institutes in Slovakia performed bacteriological examinations in 178,853 milk samples coming from 72,454 dairy cows. On an annual average, the number of examined samples was higher by 61% than in 1967-1971. Germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 22.32% of the dairy cows. The following bacterial germs were represented: Streptococcus agalactiae - 15.77%, Staphylococcus aureus - 4.19%, other streptococci - 1.49%, E. coli - 0.18%, Klebsiella sp. - 0.23%, Corynebacterium pyogenes - 0.20%, other germs - 0.26%. The number of dairy cows having bacterial germs in their milk was found higher by 1.47% than in 1967-1971. The number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae was higher by 3.29% and that of Straphylococcus aureus by 1.15% than in the period from 1967 to 1971. The higher number of the findings of the bacterial causative agents responsible for mastitis was due, in particular, to the increased number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae in milk.
TI  - [Sensitivity of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus strains to antibiotics in Slovakia during 1974].
AB  - In 1974, the State Veterinary institutes in the Slovak Socialist Republic studied the sensitivity of 4420 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1056 strains of Staphylococcus aureus to eight antibiotics. The strains were isolated from milk samples obtained from dairy cows suffering from mastitis. 100 per cent of the strains of Streptococcus agalactiae was sensitive to ampicillin, 99.23% to erythromycin, 98.70% to oxytetracycline, 93.02% to bacitracin, 90.77% to chloramphenicol, 41.97% to penicillin, 12.39% to neomycin, 9.73% to streptomycin. As to the strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 98.68 were sensitive to chloramphenicol, 98.50% to ampicillin, 97.92% to erythromycin, 94.98% to oxytetracycline, 93.85% to neomycin, 92.67% to bacitracin, 87.50% to streptomycin, and 46.24% to penicillin. The results are discussed in relation to the use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows.
TI  - [Activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the dairy cow milk serum in relation to positive mastitis test NK].
AB  - The level of total lactate dehydrogenase activity in dairy cow milk serum was studied in sets of quarter-udder milks showing different degrees of a positive response to Mastitis test-NK. The bacteriological examination for Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and for coliform germs was performed at the same time. Increasing positiveness of the response to Mastitis test-NK was found to be accompanied by almost proportionate increase of the total lactate dehydrogenase activity level in milk serum. The bacteriological finding was not correlated with increasing positiveness of the response to Mastitis test-NK. New aspects of various diseases of the mammary gland and the possibility to diagnose mainly the latent stages of these diseases are analysed in a discussion. milk serum, optical test; lactate dehydrogenase level; bacteriological finding.
TI  - [Etiology of dairy cows mastitis in Slovakia in the years 1972-1974].
AB  - In the period from 1972 to 1974, veterinary institutes in Slovakia performed bacteriological examinations in 178,853 milk samples coming from 72,454 dairy cows. On an annual average, the number of examined samples were higher by 61% than in 1967-1971. Germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 22.32% of the dairy cows. The following bacterial germs were represented: Streptococcus agalactiae -- 15.77%, Staphylococcus aureus -- 4.19%, other streptococci -- 1.49%, E. coli -- 0.18%, Klebsiella sp. -- 0.23%, Corynebacterium pyogenes -- 0.20%, other germs -- 0.26%.

TI  - Migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group A and B streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. In the present studies peptidoglycans from S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group A streptococcal peptidoglycan. In contrast, HSA-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. Sensitization of animals with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; HSA-pentapeptide again showed no activity. However, when HSA-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was evident. Skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to HSA-pentapeptide.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - Macrophages in bovine milk.
AB  - The high vacuolated mononuclear cells in milk from normal bovine mammary glands,  usually designated epithelial cells, were examined for properties characteristic of macrophages. In vitro, these cells concentrated neutral red into cytoplasmic vacuoles, adhered rapidly to and spread on glass, and phagocytosed viable Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Neutral red uptake was demonstrated in vivo, and the vacuolated mononuclear cells phagocytosed formalinkilled S aureus in vivo. These results suggest that these cells are macrophages.
TI  - Activity of penicillin and novobiocin against bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Penicillin (P), novobiocin (N), and both (P-N) were evaluated in vitro against 143 clinical isolates of bovine mastitis, including, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis. Greater antistaphylococcal activities were demonstrated with N alone and P-N than with P alone. Streptococcus spp were more susceptible to P alone than to N alone, and the effectiveness of P-N corresponded with that of P alone. In vitro, P-N had a wider spectrum of antibacterial activity than did either P or N. Similar results were also obtained in vivo, using the mouse protection test. The P-N gave a greater protection rate in mice experimentally infected with S aureus and Str agalactiae than did P or N.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. III. Effectiveness of 59 teat dips for reducing bacterial populations on teat skin.
AB  - Fifty-nine teat dips were tested for effectiveness in reducing populations of experimentally applied Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus on teat skin. The results varied widely among products. Populations of S. agalactiae recovered from dipped teats ranged from a 98.3% reduction to a 147.4% increase as compared to undipped controls. Reductions in recoverable S. aureus ranged from 98.5 to 43.6%. The products yielding the highest germicidal activity did not conform to a consistent pattern in type and concentration of active ingredients, presence or lack of specific emollients, or pH. Approximately 20% of the products yielded a low activity. Each of six oil-based products performed poorly and frequently increased numbers of organisms.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. II. Evaluation of oil-based teat dips.
AB  - Oil-based teat dips containing iodine at .5 and 1% were compared in a series of studies with two water-based iodophor products of the same concentration and also with undipped controls. When the two types of products were tested at .5% under conditions of natural infection, the water-based dip was four times more effective than the oil-based dip at preventing Staphylococcus aureus infections. In three subsequent trials teats were experimentally exposed to S. aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Five times more S. aureus infections developed in a group dipped with the oil-based dip at 1% iodine with an undipped control yielded no significant difference for S. aureus infections. The 1% iodine water-based product was nine times more effective in preventing S. aureus infections than the 1% oil-based product. Differences in the incidence of S. agalactiae infections were nonsignificant within the individual trials. Though ineffective in preventing udder infections oil-based products were effective in creating a supple condition of teat skin.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotics on hemolysin production by bacteria causing mastitis in cattle].
AB  - Effect of six antibiotics on the hemolysin formation by 320 strains of Staphylococcus (including 112 S. aureus) and 100 strains of S. agalactiae isolated from cow udders, have been determined. Tests were performed on plates containing 5% horse red cells, but the hemolytic strains were tested on blood agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep, rabbit and calf cells in addition. One strain of S. aureus produced the rings of hemolysis around the zones of growth inhibition on the media containing the discs of penicillin, erythromycin, oxyterramycin and chloramphenicol. Another strain of S. agalactiae produced similar rings, but only on the medium supplemented with penicillin. On the calf blood agar plate, S. aureus produced the hemolytic rings only in association with streptomycin and neomycin. After five times of propagation on the nutrient agar, the hemolytic phenomenon was not reproducible. It may be suggested that in cow milk there are some inhibitors for hemolysin formation by Staphylococcus and S. agalactiae.

TI  - Determination of untreated whole-milk effects on in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - The effect of fresh whole milk without pasteurization or other pretreatment on in vitro antibacterial activity of selected compounds was determined in broth dilution. The milk was collected by hand directly from dairy goats, or by syringe or cannula from bovine quarters showing low bacterial counts. Antibacterial activity was determined in 50% (v/v) milk-broth medium against sensitive mastitis-etiologic strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. The indicator salt 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride was incorporated in the milk broth medium to determine inoculum growth. Contaminant interference was circumvented through early as well as late readings and comparisons with uninoculated control tubes, with and without the test compounds. Application of the method with more than 75 compounds, including nitrofurans, antibiotics, and other chemicals uncovered marked degrees of milk interference. The method warrants routine use among preliminary screens to relate in vitro with in vivo observations of antimicrobial activity. Similar procedures may be used with serum, skim milk, or mastitis-milk media for separating effects due to protein, lipid, or other elements in product evaluation.
TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
