TI  == identification of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among reproductive age women in mysore, india.
AB  == a healthy vaginal environment is predominated by certain lactobacillus species, which lead to the prevention of infections of the reproductive tract. this study  examined the characteristics of cultivable lactobacillus species between healthy  women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). between november 2011 and sept 2013, 139 women attending a women's clinic in mysore, india were diagnosed for bv in a cross-sectional study. bv was diagnosed using amsel's criteria: homogeneous  vaginal discharge, vaginal ph > 4.5, production of amines, and presence of 'clue' cells. those with three or more of the characteristics were considered to have bv. vaginal swabs were then cultured in rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe broth.  gram-positive lactobacilli generating 600- 800bp amplicon by16 srna were further  characterized by sequencing. cultivable vaginal samples were obtained from 132 (94.9%) women. according to amsel criteria, 83(62.1%) women were healthy and 49(37.1%) women had bv. eleven different lactobacillus species were isolated from 47 women. the common lactobacilli species found in this sample included l. crispatus (39.6%), l. gasseri (45.8%), and l. jensenii (14.6%). lactobacilli were isolated from 39 healthy and 8 women with bv. l. gasseri was cultured from 18.8%  of healthy and 6.1% of women with bv. the presence of l. reuteri was significantly associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p-value = 0.026). these  results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population. our findings showed lactobacilli species  present in healthy vagina of women in india do not differ from those reported from other countries.

TI  == probiotic and technological properties of lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  == this work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. ten different strains were recognized by rep-pcr and pfge fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. these strains belonged to five species, lactobacillus gasseri (3), lactobacillus reuteri (2), lactobacillus vaginalis (2), lactobacillus fermentum (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). all ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to  epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate  fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. as expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low ph (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this ph. species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward h. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. none of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. two l. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used  as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-helicobacter and antioxidative activities. the two l. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, for growth in milk.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri is a widespread commensal lactic acid bacterium inhabiting  human mucosal niches and has many beneficial effects as a probiotic. however, l.  gasseri is difficult to grow in milk, which hurts usability for the food industry. it had been previously reported that supplementation with yeast extract or proteose peptone, including peptides, enables l. gasseri to grow well in milk. in this study, our objective was to confirm peptide requirement of l. gasseri and evaluate efficacy of peptide release by enzymatic proteolysis on growth of l. gassei in milk. three strains of l. gasseri did not grow well in modified deman,  rogosa, sharpe broth without any nitrogen sources (mrs-n), but addition of a casein-derived peptide mixture, tryptone, promoted growth. in contrast, little effect was observed after adding casein or a casein-derived amino acid mixture, casamino acids. these results indicate that l. gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, among milk-derived nitrogen sources for growth. lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t hardly had growth capacity in 6 kinds of milk-based media: bovine milk, human milk, skim milk, cheese whey, modified mrs-n (mrsl-n) supplemented with acid whey, and mrsl-n supplemented with casein. moreover, treatment with digestive proteases, particularly pepsin, to release peptides made it grow well in each milk-based medium. the pepsin treatment was the most effective for growth of strain jcm 1131t in skim milk among the tested food-grade proteases such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, calf rennet, ficin, bromelain, and papain. as well as strain jcm 1131t, pepsinolysis of milk improved growth of other l. gasseri strains and some strains of enteric lactobacilli such  as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus reuteri. these results suggest that some relatives of l. gasseri also use peptides as desirable nitrogen sources, and that milk may be a good supplier of nutritious peptides to enteric lactobacilli including l. gasseri after peptic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. this is the first report showing peptide requirement of l. gasseri and efficacy of pepsinolysis on the growth of l. gasseri and its relatives in milk. this study would contribute to increasing usability of l. gasseri and its relatives as probiotics in dairy foods.

TI  == phenotypic surface properties (aggregation, adhesion and biofilm formation) and presence of related genes in beneficial vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the phenotypic expression of auto-aggregation, adhesion to mucin and biofilm formation of lactobacilli isolated from human vagina and the presence of related genes. methods and results: seven different strains of three  lactobacillus species (lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri) were evaluated. the auto-aggregation property was determined by spectrophotometric assay and flow cytometry. adhesion and biofilm formation were assayed by crystal violet staining. the presence of the genes encoding sortases, pilin subunits and surface proteins was evaluated by polymerase chain reactions. the two lact. reuteri strains assayed showed high auto-aggregation, adhesion to mucin and biofilm formation ability. in these strains, the genes encoding three adhesion proteins were identified. in lact. rhamnosus crl (centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection) 1332, pilus-encoding genes were detected. in all lact. rhamnosus strains assayed, two genes encoding for other surface proteins related to adhesion and biofilm formation were detected. conclusions: the vaginal lactobacilli assayed exhibited  phenotypic and genetic characteristics that were specific for each strain. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study on auto-aggregation, adhesion and biofilm formation of vaginal lactobacillus strains by phenotypic and genetic assays.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == gassericin a: a circular bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == during the recent years extensive efforts have been made to find out bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (lab) active against various food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, and superior stabilities against heat treatments and ph variations. bacteriocins isolated from lab have been grouped into four classes. circular bacteriocins which were earlier grouped among the four groups of bacteriocins, have recently been proposed to be classified into a different class, making it class v bacteriocins. circular bacteriocins are special molecules, whose precursors must be post translationally modified to join the n to c termini with a head-to-tail peptide bond. cyclization appears to make them less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, high temperature and ph, and, therefore, provides enhanced stability as compared to linear bacteriocins. the advantages of circularization are also reflected by the fact that a significant number of macrocyclic natural products have found pharmaceutical applications. circular bacteriocins were unknown two decades ago, and even to date, only a few  circular bacteriocins from a diverse group of gram positive organisms have been reported. the first example of a circular bacteriocin was enterocin as-48, produced by enterococcus faecalis as-48. gassereccin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, reutericin 6 produced by lactobacillus reuteri la6 and circularin a, produced by clostridium beijerinickii atcc 25,752, are further examples of this group of antimicrobial peptides. in the present scenario, gassericin a can be an important tool in the food preservation owing to its properties of high ph  and temperature tolerance and the fact that it is produced by lab l. gasseri, whose many strains are proven probiotic.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == viability of microencapsulated probiotic lactobacilli during storage at different temperatures.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop technological and microbiological basics for the use of microencapsulated probiotics in meat products. probiotic lactobacillus (l.) reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei and l. gasseri strains were chosen for potential use in meat products. the effects of spices and naci on the microbiological stability were investigated in pilot studies. lyophilised samples were stored for 6 months withoud additives. microencapsulation was done with water-soluble and water-insoluble coatings. samples were stored at 2 degrees c and 20 degrees c for six months in gelatine solutions: without additives, with 5% naci, with 10% cloves and with 10% black pepper. spices and salt exhibited a strong inhibitive effect on the bacterial counts of the tested strains. during storage the lyophilised probiotic strains were stable at 2 degrees c and at 20 degrees c. protective effects of the microencapsulation however were heterogenous. although at the beginning protective effects against the antimicrobial activity of cloves were shown for l. rhamnosus, none of the tested  coatings were able to protect durably. l. paracasei proved to be very stable in general. the use of probiotic lactobacilli strains in meat products seems possible as protective effects of the microencapsulation were recognised. however, these effects must be tested for each specific application, e.g. strain/additive combination, due to individual strain differences.

TI  == preventive effects of lactobacillus mixture on experimental e. coli urinary tract infection in infant rats.
AB  == purpose: urinary tract infection (uti) is an ascending infection of fecal uropathogens, urogenital lactobacilli are suggested to play a role in the prevention of uti. this study was to investigate whether lactobacillus mixture (lm) could prevent the experimental infantile uti. materials and methods: the lm  were composed of three lactobacillus strains (l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuteri). mother rats were grouped as lactobacillus (lb) group i (lb i, n=22), ii (lb ii, n=24) and control (n=20). lb i and lb ii were fed with lm (1 ml/day) and  control with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) from late pregnancy through lactation. all newborn rats were breast-fed and their urine and stool were collected at the end of the 3rd week to compare lactobacillus colony. then, infant rats from lb ii were treated with intravesical instillation of lm. infant  rats from lb i and control were instilled with pbs. twenty-four hours later, experimental uti was introduced by intravesical instillation of standard e. coli  strain. after 72 hours later, the infant rats were sacrificed for histologic examination. results: lactobacilli colonies in urine and stool were not statistically different among the three groups. the incidence of pyelonephritis in the lb ii was 16.7% (4/24), lb i 72.7% (16.22) and control 75.0% (15/20) (p=0.015). the incidence of cystitis was not significantly different among the three groups. conclusion: the intravesically instilled lm significantly prevented experimental pyelonephritis in infant rats, however, lm administered orally to the pregnant and lactating mother rats did not.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic  rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus reuteri. the rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. the symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering ldl-c, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and ldl-c than the phytosterol-containing treatment. the phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. in conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to  lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.

TI  == screening of biofilm formation by beneficial vaginal lactobacilli and influence of culture media components.
AB  == aims: to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacilli to form biofilm under different culture conditions and to determine the relationship between their growth and the capability of biofilm formation by selected strains. methods and results: fifteen lactobacillus strains from human vagina were tested for biofilm  formation by crystal violet staining. only lactobacillus rhamnosus centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection (crl) 1332, lact. reuteri crl 1324 and lact. delbrueckii crl 1510 were able to grow and form biofilm in culture media without tween 80. however, lact. gasseri crl 1263 (a non-biofilm-forming strain) did not grow in these media. scanning electron microscopy showed that lact. rhamnosus crl 1332 and lact. reuteri crl 1324 formed a highly structured biofilm, but only lact. reuteri crl 1324 showed a high amount of extracellular material in medium without tween. conclusions: biofilm formation was significantly influenced by the strain, culture medium, inoculum concentration, microbial growth and chemical nature of the support used for the assay. significance and impacts of the study: the results allow the selection of biofilm-forming vaginal lactobacillus strains and the conditions and factors that affect this phenomenon.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == inhibitory potential of lactobacilli against escherichia coli internalization by  ht 29 cells.
AB  == a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization method was employed to evaluate  the competitive inhibitory effect of three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus plantarum) against escherichia  coli internalization in a model system of ht 29 cells. furthermore, aggregation and adhesion abilities of the lactobacillus strains were examined. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the ht 29 cells and aggregate with pathogens; however, the adhesion and aggregation degree was strain-dependent. l. reuteri possessed a high capacity of adhesion (6.80 +/- 0.63; log cfu +/- sem per well),  whereas lower capacities were expressed by l. gasseri (4.52 +/- 0.55) and l. plantarum (4.90 +/- 0.98). additionally, l. reuteri showed the rapid or normal ability to aggregate with selected e. coli in comparison with remaining two lactobacilli, which showed only slow or negative aggregative reaction. internalization of e. coli into the cell lines was markedly suppressed by l. reuteri, while l. gasseri and l. plantarum caused only a minimum anti-invasion effect. the fact that l. reuteri in our experiments showed an outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with the rest  strains, suggested that one of the possible mechanisms of preventing pathogen adhesion and invasion is simple competitions at certain receptors and capability  to block receptor binding sites, or that an avid interaction between l. reuteri and the host cell might be modulating intracellular events responsible for the e. coli internalization. moreover, l. reuteri exhibited a strong ability to aggregate with e. coli, which could be another limiting factor of pathogen invasion.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == conjugative plasmid from lactobacillus gasseri la39 that carries genes for production of and immunity to the circular bacteriocin gassericin a.
AB  == gassericin a is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri strain la39. we found a 33,333-bp plasmid, designated plgla39, in this strain. plgla39 contained 44 open reading frames, including seven genes related to gassericin a production/immunity (gaa), as well as genes for replication, plasmid maintenance, and conjugative transfer. plgla39 was transferred from la39 to the type strain of l. gasseri (jcm 1131) by filter mating. the transconjugant exhibited >30-fold-higher more resistance to gassericin a and produced antibacterial activity. lactobacillus reuteri la6, the producer of reutericin 6, was proved to  harbor a plasmid indistinguishable from plgla39 and carrying seven genes 100% identical to gaa. this suggests that plgla39 might have been transferred naturally between l. gasseri la39 and l. reuteri la6. the seven gaa genes of plgla39 were cloned into a plasmid vector to construct pgaa. jcm 1131(t) transformed with pgaa expressed antibacterial activity and resistance to gassericin a. pgaa was segregationally more stable than a pgaa derivative plasmid from which gaaa was deleted and even was more stable than the vector. this suggests the occurrence of postsegregational host killing by the gaa genes. plgla39 carried a pemik homolog, and segregational stabilization of a plasmid by  the plgla39-type pemik genes was also confirmed. thus, plgla39 was proved to carry the genes for at least two plasmid maintenance mechanisms, i.e., gaa and pemik. plasmids containing a repa gene similar to plgla39 repa were distributed in several l. gasseri strains.

TI  == isolation of lactobacilli with probiotic properties from the human stomach.
AB  == aims: recent evidence suggests that the human gastric microbiota is much more diverse than previously thought. the aim of this study was to assess the potential for isolating lactobacilli from the human stomach. methods and results: lactobacilli were selectively cultured from gastric biopsies from 12 patients undergoing routine endoscopy. lactobacilli were present in four of 12 biopsies. we isolated, in total 10 different strains representing five species (lactobacillus gasseri, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis, l. reuteri and l. salivarius). the 10 isolates varied greatly in their ability to inhibit the growth of two gram-positive bacteria and two gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, the acid and bile resistance profiles of the 10 isolates spanned a wide range. conclusions: five different lactobacillus species were cultured from human gastric biopsies for the first time. significance and impact of the study: diverse lactobacillus species are more prevalent in the human stomach than previously recognized, representing an untapped source of bacteria with beneficial probiotic and/or biotechnological properties.

TI  == adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human specific pathogenic bacterium that colonises the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhoea. in this study we  analysed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. we show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between lactobacillus species. lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence while lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached  to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. hence, gonococci bind to colonised lactobacilli  and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting  in reduced bacterial colonisation. also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of  removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

AB  == five lactobacillus strains (2 l. gasseri, 2 l. plantarum and 1 l. reuteri) were cultured in modified mrs medium containing fatty acids (fas) instead of tween 80  for 24 h at 37 degrees c, to learn the effect of saturated and unsaturated fas on the lactobacillus growth. free fas included palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (c9-16:1), stearic (18:0), oleic (c9-18:1), elaidic (t9-18:1), cis-vaccenic (c11-18:1), vaccenic (t11-18:1), linoleic (c9, c12-18:2), conjugated linoleic (c9, t11- and t10, c12-18:2), alpha-linolenic (c9, c12, c15-18:3), alpha-eleostearic (c9, t11, t13-18:3), eicosapentaenoic (20:5), and docosahexaenoic (22:6) acids. among free fas, oleic acid stimulated the growth of all lactobacillus strains, whereas palmitoleic acid had almost no affect on the lactobacillus growth. saturated fas such as stearic and palmitic acids inhibited  or did not affect the lactobacillus growth. polyunsaturated fas such as alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids strongly inhibited the lactobacillus growth at 7.6 x 10(-4) m. octadecenoic acids such as oleic, elaidic, cis-vaccenic and vaccenic acids remarkably promoted the growth of l. gasseri, regardless of the different double bond positions and configurations. when oleic or cis-vaccenic acid was incubated with l. gasseri, the fas was transformed to cyclopropane fas (methyleneoctadecanoic acids) after incorporation into the cells. on the other hand, trans fas such as elaidic and vaccenic acids incorporated into the cells were not converted to another fas. conjugated linoleic and alpha-eleostearic acids having a trans double bond promoted the lactobacillus growth. the growth of l. gasseri was also stimulated by trans-rich  free fas from hydrogenated canola and fish oils. these results showed that octadecenoic acid and trans fas had strong promotion activities for the lactobacillus growth due to their incorporation into membrane lipids.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == structural and functional differences in two cyclic bacteriocins with the same sequences produced by lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri la39 and l. reuteri la6 isolated from feces of the same human infant were found to produce similar cyclic bacteriocins (named gassericin  a and reutericin 6, respectively) that cannot be distinguished by molecular weights or primary amino acid sequences. however, reutericin 6 has a narrower spectrum than gassericin a. in this study, gassericin a inhibited the growth of l. reuteri la6, but reutericin 6 did not inhibit the growth of l. gasseri la39. both bacteriocins caused potassium ion efflux from indicator cells and liposomes, but the amounts of efflux and patterns of action were different. although circular dichroism spectra of purified bacteriocins revealed that both antibacterial peptides are composed mainly of alpha-helices, the spectra of the bacteriocins did not coincide. the results of d- and l-amino acid composition analysis showed that two residues and one residue of d-ala were detected among 18 ala residues of gassericin a and reutericin 6, respectively. these findings suggest that the different d-alanine contents of the bacteriocins may cause the differences in modes of action, amounts of potassium ion efflux, and secondary structures. this is the first report that characteristics of native bacteriocins  produced by wild lactobacillus strains having the same structural genes are influenced by a difference in d-amino acid contents in the molecules.

AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus isolates from infant faeces by sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == isolates of lactobacilli from infant faeces phenotypically characterized as lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (six strains), lact. rhamnosus (six strains), lact. gasseri (three strains), lact. acidophilus (one strain) and lact. fermentum/reuteri (three strains) according to recent classification systems were subjected to sds-page of whole cell proteins and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization, in order to confirm the phenotypic characterization and elucidate the exact taxonomic position of the three strains that had properties between fermentum and reuteri. results suggested a good agreement between the phenotypic characterization, sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization for strains of all species except for the lact. fermentum/reuteri strains. results obtained by rrna probes suggested a possible phylogenetic relatedness of the strains to lact. reuteri. isolates from infant faeces with interesting probiotic properties could be used as components of fermented milk products.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == systematics of the lactobacillus population on rat intestinal mucosa with special reference to lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the systematics of the lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (molin et al. 1992). one-hundred-twenty-two lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of lactobacillus and leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. data were examined using jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% sj-similarity level: cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. crispatus, and to some extent to l. acidophilus. cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as l. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. the genomic homogeneity of the l. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna, and the isolates could  be divided into six genomic strains.
