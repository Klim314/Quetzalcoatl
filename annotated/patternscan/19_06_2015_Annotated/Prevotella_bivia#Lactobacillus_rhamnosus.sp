TI  == adhesion of human probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus to cervical and vaginal cells and interaction with vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the ability of a probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (lcr35) to  adhere to cervical and vaginal cells and to affect the viability of two main vaginosis-associated pathogens, prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis, as well  as candida albicans was investigated. methods: adhesion ability was determined in vitro with immortalized epithelial cells from the endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina. coculture experiments were performed to count viable pathogens cells in the presence of lcr35. results: lcr35 was able to specifically and rapidly adhere to the three cell lines. in coculture assays, a decrease in pathogen cell division rate was observed as from 4 hours of incubation and bactericidal activity after a longer period of incubation, mostly with p. bivia. conclusion: the ability of lcr35 to adhere to cervicovaginal cells and its antagonist activities against vaginosis-associated pathogens suggest that this probiotic strain is a promising candidate for use in therapy.

TI  == lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by vaginal lactobacillus rhamnosus, targets  cytoplasmic membranes of the vaginal pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a commonly occurring vaginal infection that is associated with a variety of serious risks related to the reproductive health of  women. conventional antibiotic treatment for this condition is frequently ineffective because the antibiotics tend to inhibit healthy vaginal microflora along with the pathogens. lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by healthy vaginal lactobacilli, is a promising alternative to antibiotics; this compound specifically inhibits the bv-associated vaginal pathogens such as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia without affecting the healthy microflora. this study investigates the molecular mechanism of action for lactocin 160 and reveals that this compound targets the cytoplasmic membrane of g. vaginalis, causing the  efflux of atp molecules and dissipation of the proton motive force.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.
