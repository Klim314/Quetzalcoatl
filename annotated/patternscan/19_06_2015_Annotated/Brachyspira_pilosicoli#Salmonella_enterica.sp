TI  == the prevalence of swine enteropathogens in brazilian grower and finish herds.
AB  == diarrhoea among growing and finishing pigs is an important problem in many herds. the prevalence of l. intracellularis, b. pilosicoli, b. hyodysenteriae, salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, trichuris suis and the occurrence of mixed infection were investigated. fecal samples for forty-six herds with diarrhea or a history of diarrhea were randomly collected in minas gerais state,  brazil. the enteric pathogens were detected by culture (e. coli and salmonella sp.), pcr (l. intracellularis and brachyspira spp.) and eggs counts (t. suis). the overall herd prevalence of l. intracellularis, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and enterotoxigenic e. coli were 19.56%, 6.52%, 10.86% respectively.  mixed infection was diagnosed in 30.43% of herds, and l. intracellularis and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium are main pathogens association (10.87%). b. pilosicoli was diagnosed only in two herds, always associated with mixed infections. b. hyodysenteriae and t. suis were not demonstrated in any sample. these pathogens have been reported world-wide but studies regarding epidemiology  in brazil are few. this study contributes to establish of prevention programs for the control enteropathogens in grower finish herds in brazil.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == prevalence of selected enteropathogenic bacteria in hungarian finishing pigs.
AB  == the aim of this study was to obtain prevalence estimates about the most important enteropathogenic bacteria: lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira hyodysenteriae,  brachyspira pilosicoli, salmonella enterica and clostridium perfringens a and c in hungarian farrow-to-finish pig herds. a total of 31 herds were selected, from  where six pooled faecal samples, each containing three individual rectal faecal samples were collected from fattening pigs of 5-6 months of age. all 186 samples  were examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the presence of the pathogens mentioned above. lawsonia intracellularis was found in 29 herds (93.55%) and in 108 samples (58.06%); b. hyodysenteriae in 14 herds (45.16%) and  in 23 samples (12.37%); b. pilosicoli in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 53 samples (28.49%); s. enterica in 17 herds (54.83%) and in 40 samples (21.50%). we detected the presence of c. perfringens a in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 46 samples  (24.73%), while c. perfringens c was found in 8 herds (25.81%) and in 11 samples  (5.91%). all examined herds were infected with one or more of these agents. herds with diarrhoea in the mid- to late finishing phase had almost 10 times higher prevalence of b. hyodysenteriae than herds without such a history.

TI  == prevalence of intestinal pathogens in danish finishing pig herds.
AB  == our aim was to determine the prevalence of the intestinal bacteria: lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira hyodysenteriae, serpulina intermedia, brachyspira innocens, brachyspira pilosicoli, pathogenic escherichia coli (serogroups o138, o139, o141 and o149) and salmonella enterica in danish finishing pig herds. a total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998. from each herd,  20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50kg. furthermore, 10 pooled pen samples were collected and examined for s. enterica. in total, 1580 faecal samples and 790 pen samples were collected and examined by  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) or culture. l. intracellularis was found in 74 herds (93.7%), b. hyodysenteriae in two herds (2.5%), s. intermedia in 10 herds (12. 7%), b. innocens in 27 herds (34.2%), b. pilosicoli in 15 herds (19. 0%), pathogenic e. coli in 19 herds (24.1%) and s. enterica in eight herds (10.1%). the within-herd prevalences of l. intracellularis and b. hyodysenteriae were 25-30%; the within-herd prevalences of the other agents were 5-10%. three herds (4%) were not infected with any of the bacteria and 25 herds (32%) were only infected with l. intracellularis.

TI  == comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  == enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. the most common etiological agents include escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, lawsonia intracellularis, salmonella enterica, and brachyspira (serpulina) spp. with the exception of brachyspira (serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine  dysentery, and lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy,  the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic e. coli and c. perfringens type a), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic e. coli and brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with s. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain c. perfringens. extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of e. coli and most serotypes of s. enterica. enteric bacterial diseases of swine have  been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.

TI  == detection of lawsonia intracellularis, serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes, salmonella enterica, and haemolytic escherichia coli from swine herds with and without diarrhoea among growing pigs.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was optimized to detect lawsonia intracellularis in faeces from naturally infected pigs. by combining a boiling procedure to extract dna and a nested pcr procedure, a detection limit at 2 x 10(2) bacterial cells per gram of faeces was achieved. the optimized pcr was used together with conventional culture techniques to detect serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes (wbhis), salmonella enterica, and  haemolytic escherichia coli, in a case control study to examine selected risk factors for the development of diarrhoea in growing pigs. herds with diarrhoea were selected as cases and randomly chosen herds without diarrhoea were chosen as controls. infection with l. intracellularis significantly enhanced the chance of  diarrhoea. s. hyodysenteriae, wbhis group iv (serpulina pilosicoli), and s. enterica were isolated only from case herds which indicate that these species may influence the development of diarrhoea. in addition, herd-type had a significant  impact, that is specific pathogen-free herds showed an odds ratio at 0.2 relative to conventional herds for the development of diarrhoea.
