TI  == distinctive intestinal lactobacillus communities in six-month-old infants from rural malawi and south-western finland.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to compare the composition and diversity of lactobacillus microbiota in infants living in malawi and south-western finland. methods: the composition and diversity of the lactobacillus group was analyzed in the feces of healthy six-month-old infants living in rural malawi (n = 44) and south-western finland (n = 31), using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (qpcr)  and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (dgge). results: malawian infants had higher counts of lactobacilli than their finnish counterparts (7.45 log cells/g vs. 6.86 log cells/g, p < 0.001, respectively) and the lactobacillus community was richer and more diverse in the malawian infants.  leuconostoc citreum and weissella confusa were the predominant species in both study groups, but malawian infants were more often colonized by these species (100 % vs. 74.2 % p < 0.001; 95.5 % vs. 41.9 %, p < 0.001, respectively). moreover, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus mucosae were detected more often in the malawian infants (59.1  % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 38.6 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.004; 29.5 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 22.7 % vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.017, respectively). however, lactobacillus casei group species were only detected in the finnish infants. conclusions: malawian infants  have a more abundant lactobacillus microbiota with a distinct composition compared to finnish infants. the environment, including diet and hygiene, may be  among the factors influencing these differences.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == selection and optimization procedure of synbiotic for cholesterol removal.
AB  == a selection and optimization procedure for the synbiotic combination of probiotic and prebiotics was established to optimize its cholesterol removal in vitro. in light of fermentability, prebiotics utilization by probiotics was highly variable and interspecies differences existed. based on the results of fermentability, l.  plantarum ls12, ls31, lp529 and l. ruminis la3 could be the better candidates for symbiotic research. the bile tolerance of all the tested strains could be improved by the strain-specific prebiotics comparing to the control carbon source (glucose). the strain ls12 was finally selected to form the symbiotic according to its better ability to ferment prebiotics and bile tolerance, while the five prebiotics (fos, stachyose, gos, imo and mannitol) were selected to make their synbiotic combination because of their better enhancement of bile tolerance and growth support to ls12. the synbiotic combination for cholesterol removal was optimized by use of response surface methodology. the first-order model showed that the selected prebiotics mannitol and gos were significant factors. then through the second-order polynomial regression model, the optimum conditions of the two factors for cholesterol removal by the synbiotic were suggested.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == [lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  == lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. they are represented mainly by lactobacillus acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. fermentum and l. buchneri. streptococcus faecium is always isolated. l. ruminis, l. vitulinus, l. delbrueckii, l. coryniformis and l. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. s. faecium and s. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by l. plantarum. l. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees c whatever is the species they belong  to.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
