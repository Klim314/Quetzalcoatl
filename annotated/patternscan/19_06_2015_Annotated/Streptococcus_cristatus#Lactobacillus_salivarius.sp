TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == salmonellae reduction in poultry by competitive exclusion bacteria lactobacillus  salivarius and streptococcus cristatus.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a defined competitive exclusion bacteria (ce) culture that will prevent or substantially reduce salmonella colonization of poultry. the efficacy of 56 potential ce isolates in preventing or reducing salmonella colonization in chickens was determined. these potential ce were perorally administered to day-of-hatch chicks at 10(6) to 10(8) cfu per chick, and salmonellae were subsequently administered by gavage 2 days later at 5.5 x 10(3) to 5.0 x 10(4) cfu per chick. feeding chickens an overnight ce culture of lactobacillus salivarius strains salm-9, list40-1,8, or list40-41 reduced salmonella carriage in cecal contents by 2.10, 2.52, and 2.20 log cfu/g (average of three trials), respectively. the percentages of salmonella-positive chickens after receiving these treatments were 35, 31, and 35% respectively, compared with 84% for the untreated control. a mixture of these three isolates had a similar effect when compared with the results of the individual isolates. a mixture of streptococcus cristatus list40-13 and l. salivarius list40-41 reduced  salmonella carriage from 90 to 65% and 88 to 31% in two feeding trials, and by 2.2 and 4 log cfu/g of cecal contents of chickens. in conclusion, ce isolates l.  salivarius salm-9, list40-18, and list40-41 and s. cristatus list40-13 either individually or in combination were effective in significantly preventing salmonella colonization of chickens.
