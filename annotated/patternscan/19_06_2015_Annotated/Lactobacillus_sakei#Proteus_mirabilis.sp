TI  == in vitro synthesis of biogenic amines by brochothrix thermosphacta isolates from  meat and meat products and the influence of other microorganisms.
AB  == twenty brochothrix thermosphacta strains tested for biogenic amines (bas) production, formed histamine (6.6-16.2 mg/kg) and tyramine (18.7-35.4 mg/kg) but  neither putrescine nor cadaverine. six of the twenty strains were also investigated in respect of their influence on the synthesis of bas by escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., proteus mirabilis and lactobacillus sakei. in pure culture escherichia coli produced all of the studied amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) with a total concentration of 167.7 mg/kg, p. mirabilis produced a total of 56.7 mg/kg histamine, tyramine and cadaverine, while lactobacillus sakei and pseudomonas sp. produced histamine and tyramine, totaling 37.9 and 35.2 mg/kg respectively. all b. thermosphacta promoted cadaverine production by escherichia coli which increased by 12-68%, and some of  them contributed to the appearance of this amine among the metabolites of pseudomonas. the presence of b. thermosphacta decreased the potential ability of  p. mirabilis to produce bas.
