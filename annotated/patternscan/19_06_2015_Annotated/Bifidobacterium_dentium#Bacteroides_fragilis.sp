TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == integrated analysis of established and novel microbial and chemical methods for microbial source tracking.
AB  == several microbes and chemicals have been considered as potential tracers to identify fecal sources in the environment. however, to date, no one approach has  been shown to accurately identify the origins of fecal pollution in aquatic environments. in this multilaboratory study, different microbial and chemical indicators were analyzed in order to distinguish human fecal sources from nonhuman fecal sources using wastewaters and slurries from diverse geographical areas within europe. twenty-six parameters, which were later combined to form derived variables for statistical analyses, were obtained by performing methods that were achievable in all the participant laboratories: enumeration of fecal coliform bacteria, enterococci, clostridia, somatic coliphages, f-specific rna phages, bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056 and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ga17, and total and sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria; genotyping of f-specific rna phages; biochemical phenotyping of fecal coliform bacteria and enterococci using miniaturized tests; specific detection of bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium; and measurement of four fecal sterols. a number of potentially useful source indicators were detected (bacteriophages infecting b. thetaiotaomicron, certain genotypes of f-specific bacteriophages, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and epycoprostanol), although no one source identifier alone provided 100% correct classification of the fecal source. subsequently, 38 variables (both single and derived) were defined from the measured microbial and chemical parameters in order to find the best subset of variables to develop predictive models using the lowest possible number of measured parameters. to this end, several statistical or machine learning methods were evaluated and provided two successful predictive models based on just two variables, giving 100% correct classification: the ratio of the densities of somatic coliphages and phages infecting bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of somatic coliphages and the ratio of the densities of fecal coliform bacteria and phages infecting bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of fecal coliform bacteria. other models with high rates of correct classification were developed, but in these cases, higher numbers of variables were required.
