TI  - Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Three Gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, spindle-shaped bacterial strains (HT03-11(T), KO-38 and TT-111), isolated from human faeces were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the strains were highly related to each other genetically (displaying >99 % sequence similarity) and represented a previously unknown subline within the Blautia coccoides rRNA group of organisms (cluster XIVa). The closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain HT03-11(T) were Clostridium bolteae WAL 16351(T) (93.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1(T) (93.7 % similarity). All isolates produced lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and succinic acid as fermentation end products from glucose. Their chemotaxonomic properties included lysine as the cell wall diamino acid and C16 : 0, C18 : 1omega7c DMA and C16 : 0 DMA as the major fatty acids. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA were 46.9-47.2 mol% (HPLC). Several phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics could be readily used to differentiate the isolates from phylogenetically related clostridia. Therefore, strains HT03-11(T), KO-38 and TT-111 represent a novel species in a new genus of the family Lachnospiraceae, for which the name Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is HT03-11(T) ( = YIT 12554(T) = JCM 18507(T) = DSM 26062(T)).
TI  - Clostridium saccharogumia sp. nov. and Lactonifactor longoviformis gen. nov., sp. nov., two novel human faecal bacteria involved in the conversion of the dietary phytoestrogen secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - Two anaerobic bacteria involved in the conversion of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were isolated from faeces of a healthy male adult. The first isolate, strain SDG-Mt85-3Db, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic Gram-positive helically coiled rod. Based on 16S r RNA gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were Clostridium cocleatum (96.7% similarity) and Clostridium ramosum (96.6%). In contrast to these species, the isolate was devoid of alpha-galactosidase and -glucosidase and did not grow on maltose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and trehalose. The hypothesis that strain SDG-Mt85-3Db represents a new bacterial species of the Clostridium cluster XVIII was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridisation experiments. The G+C content of DNA of strain SDG-Mt85-3Db (30.7+/-0.8 mol%) was comparable with that of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. The name Clostridium saccharogumia is proposed for strain SDG-Mt85-3Db (=DSM 17460T=CCUG 51486T). The second isolate, strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic Gram-positive regular rod. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were Clostridium amygdalinum (93.3%), Clostridium saccharolyticum (93.1%) and Ruminococcus productus (93.0%). The isolate differed from these species in its ability to dehydrogenate enterodiol. It also possessed alpha-arabinosidase and -galactosidase and had a higher G+C content of DNA (48.0 mol%). According to these findings, it is proposed to create a novel genus, Lactonifactor, and a novel species, Lactonifactor longoviformis, to accommodate strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6. The type strain is DSM 17459T (=CCUG 51487T).
TI  - Mechanism of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum beta-xylosidase: kinetic studies.
AB  - The catalytic mechanism of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum beta-xylosidase  (XynB) from family 39 of glycoside hydrolases has been subjected to a detailed kinetic investigation using a range of substrates. The enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence of k(cat)/K(m), reflecting apparent pK(a) values of 4.1 and 6.8. The k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) values for a series of aryl xylosides have been measured and used to construct two Bronsted plots. The plot of log(k(cat)/K(m)) against the pK(a) of the leaving group reveals a significant correlation (beta(lg) = -0.97, r(2) = 0.94, n = 8), indicating that fission of the glycosidic bond is significantly advanced in the transition state leading to the formation of the xylosyl-enzyme intermediate. The large negative value of the slope indicates that there is relatively little proton donation to the glycosidic oxygen in the transition state. A biphasic, concave-downward plot of log(k(cat)) against pK(a) provides good evidence for a two-step double-displacement mechanism involving a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. For activated leaving groups (pK(a) < 9), the breakdown of the xylosyl-enzyme intermediate is the rate-determining step, as indicated by the absence of any effect of the pK(a) of the leaving group on log(k(cat)) (beta(lg) approximately 0). However, a strong dependence of the first-order rate constant on the pK(a) value of relatively poor leaving groups (pK(a) > 9) suggests that the xylosylation step is rate-determining for these substrates. Support for the dexylosylation chemical step being rate-determining for activated substrates comes from nucleophilic competition experiments in which addition of dithiothreitol results in an increase in turnover rates. Normal secondary alpha-deuterium kinetic isotope effects ((alpha-D)(V) or (alpha-D)(V/K) = 1.08-1.10) for three different substrates of widely varying pK(a) value (5.15-9.95) have been measured and these reveal that the transition states leading to the formation and breakdown of the intermediate are similar and both steps involve rehybridization of C1 from sp(3) to sp(2). These results are consistent only with "exploded" transition states, in which the saccharide moiety bears considerable positive charge, and the intermediate is a covalent acylal-ester where C1 is sp(3) hybridized.
TI  - Family 10 and 11 xylanase genes from Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain Rt69B.1.
AB  - Three family 10 xylanase genes (xynA, xynB, and xynC) and a single family 11 xylanase gene (xynD) were identified from the extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt69B.1 through the use of consensus PCR in conjunction with sequencing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These genes appear to comprise the complete endoxylanase system of Rt69B.1. The xynA gene was found to be homologous to the xynA gene of the closely related Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt8B.4, and primers designed previously to amplify the Rt8B.4 xynA gene could amplify homologous full-length xynA gene fragments from Rt69B.1. The complete nucleotide sequences of the Rt69B.1 xynB, xynC, and xynD genes were obtained using genomic walking PCR. The full-length xynB and xynC genes are more than 5 kb in length and encode highly modular enzymes that are the largest xylanases reported to date. XynB has an architecture similar to the family 10 xylanases from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (XynA) and Clostridium thermocellum (XynX) and may be cell wall associated, while XynC is a bifunctional enzyme with an architecture similar to the bifunctional beta-glycanases from Caldicellulosiroptor saccharolyticus. The xynD gene encodes a two-domain family 11 xylanase that is identical in architecture to the XynB family 11 xylanase from the unrelated extreme thermophile Dictyoglomus thermophilum strain Rt46B.1. The sequence similarities between the Rt69B.1 xylanases with respect to their evolution are discussed.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes from the thermophile "Caldocellum saccharolyticum".
AB  - A lambda recombinant bacteriophage coding for xylanase and beta-xylosidase activity has been isolated from a genomic library of the extremely thermophilic anaerobe "Caldocellum saccharolyticum." Partial Sau3AI fragments of the lambda recombinant DNA were ligated into pBR322. A recombinant plasmid with an insertion of ca. 7 kilobases of thermophilic DNA expressing both enzymatic activities was isolated. The location of the genes has been established by analyzing deletion derivatives, and the DNA sequence of 6.067 kilobases of the insert has been determined. Five open reading frames (ORFs) were found, one of which (ORF1; Mr 40,455) appears to code for a xylanase (XynA) which also acts on o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. Another, ORF5 (Mr 56,365), codes for a beta-xylosidase (XynB). The xynA gene product shows significant homology with the xylanases from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C125 and Clostridium thermocellum.
