TI  == the vaginal microflora in relation to gingivitis.
AB  == background: gingivitis has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcome (apo). bacterial vaginosis (bv) has been associated with apo. we assessed if bacterial counts in bv is associated with gingivitis suggesting a systemic infectious susceptibilty. methods: vaginal samples were collected from 180 women (mean age 29.4 years, sd +/- 6.8, range: 18 to 46), and at least six months after delivery, and assessed by semi-quantitative dna-dna checkerboard hybridization assay (74 bacterial species). bv was defined by gram stain (nugent criteria). gingivitis was defined as bleeding on probing at >or= 20% of tooth sites. results: a nugent  score of 0-3 (normal vaginal microflora) was found in 83 women (46.1%), and a score of > 7 (bv) in 49 women (27.2%). gingivitis was diagnosed in 114 women (63.3%). women with a diagnosis of bv were more likely to have gingivitis (p = 0.01). independent of gingival conditions, vaginal bacterial counts were higher (p < 0.001) for 38/74 species in bv+ in comparison to bv- women. counts of four lactobacilli species were higher in bv- women (p < 0.001). independent of bv diagnosis, women with gingivitis had higher counts of prevotella bivia (p < 0.001), and prevotella disiens (p < 0.001). p. bivia, p. disiens, m. curtisii and m. mulieris (all at the p < 0.01 level) were found at higher levels in the bv+/g+ group than in the bv+/g- group. the sum of bacterial load (74 species) was higher in the bv+/g+ group than in the bv+/g- group (p < 0.05). the highest odds ratio for the presence of bacteria in vaginal samples (> 1.0 x 104 cells) and a diagnosis of gingivitis was 3.9 for p. bivia (95% ci 1.5-5.7, p < 0.001) and 3.6  for p. disiens (95%ci: 1.8-7.5, p < 0.001), and a diagnosis of bv for p. bivia (odds ratio: 5.3, 95%ci: 2.6 to 10.4, p < 0.001) and p. disiens (odds ratio: 4.4, 95% ci: 2.2 to 8.8, p < 0.001). conclusion: higher vaginal bacterial counts can be found in women with bv and gingivitis in comparison to women with bv but not gingivitis. p. bivia and p. disiens may be of specific significance in a relationship between vaginal and gingival infections.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == fibronectin and laminin binding of urogenital and oral prevotella species.
AB  == 88 strains of five prevotella species--p. bivia, p. buccae, p. disiens, p. oralis, and p. oris--were examined for their fibronectin and laminin binding properties with the aid of latex particle agglutination assays. beside single protein binding activities, all species showed strains that adhered to both fibronectin and laminin. the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with p. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than p. disiens. within the oral species group, p. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did p. buccae and p. oris. the finding of species-related different binding  properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris. moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and  maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.

TI  == comparison of activities of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) and five other agents against 585 anaerobes with use of three media.
AB  == agar dilution testing was used to compare the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin against 585 anaerobes. the activity of trovafloxacin was superior to  those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with 94%, 91%, 96%, 100%, 90%, and 100% inhibition of bacteroides fragilis, non-fragilis bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus magnus/peptostreptococcus micros, clostridium perfringens, prevotella bivia/prevotella disiens, and fusobacterium species, respectively, at  a breakpoint of 2 micrograms/ml. trovafloxacin was more active than clindamycin against most anaerobes and slightly less active than imipenem and metronidazole.  different testing media, which were compared side by side, did affect the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin but did not affect those of the other antibiotics. testing with supplemented brain-heart infusion agar demonstrated lower minimum inhibitory concentrations than did testing with wilkins-chalgren agar and supplemented brucella agar. the activity of trovafloxacin was twofold lower when the ph of the testing media was adjusted  to 6.0 than when the ph of the testing media was adjusted to 7.0 or 7.5.

TI  == a study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  == one hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 gardnerella vaginalis, 16 mobiluncus spp., 19 peptostreptococcus spp., 20 lactobacillus spp., 20 prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 bacteroides fragilis group, 12 clostridium spp., and five fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and a reference (brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. for the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). the quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. results with b. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. the absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. the etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented prevotella species.
AB  == collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (ctrps) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. pms and ctrp classifications were compared with a previous  classification based on visual analysis of sds-page patterns. although the order  of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. cluster membership in the pms classification correlated particularly well with sds-page results. ctrp clusters  corresponded largely to the recognised species of prevotella, but pms and sds-page divided two species into sub-groups: two in p. buccae and five in p. veroralis. the latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in ctrps. an undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of p. buccae strains in pms and ctrps. b. (p.) capillus could not be distinguished from p. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. strains of p. zoogleoformans and b. (p.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in pms. a complex comprising clusters of p. disiens, p. oralis, p. veroralis, p. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to p. melaninogenica was well differentiated from p. buccae and p. oris in pms; clusters corresponding to p. bivia, p. corporis, p. intermedia and p. denticola formed another complex.

TI  == characterisation of non-pigmented species of the genus prevotella by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, prevotella. the non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. a polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to  compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. reference strains of p. oralis, p. veroralis, p.  buccalis, p. oris, p. buccae, p. zoogleoformans, p. bivia, p. disiens, p. oulora, b. (p.) capillus and b. (p.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (glc) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sds-page. there was close correlation between patterns  of results in biochemical and glc tests and the sds-page profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in sds-page. the periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by sds-page; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. by sds-page, clinical isolates of p. buccae (42 isolates) and  p. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. however, for p. veroralis (15), p. oris (7), p. bivia (4), p. zoogleoformans (2)  and p. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. twelve isolates remained undesignated in sds-page analysis. variant sds-page profiles divided clinical isolates of p. buccae into two subgroups and those of p. veroralis into five subgroups.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common of the vaginitides affecting women of reproductive age. it appears to be due to an alteration in the vaginal ecology by which lactobacillus spp., the predominant organisms in the healthy vagina, are replaced by a mixed flora including prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, porphyromonas spp., mobiluncus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. all of these organisms except mobiluncus spp. are also members of the endogenous vaginal flora. while evidence from treatment trials does not support the notion that bv is sexually transmitted, recent studies have shown an increased risk associated with multiple sexual partners. it has also been suggested that the pathogenesis of bv may be similar to that of urinary tract infections, with the rectum serving as a reservoir for some bv-associated flora. the organisms associated with bv have also been recognized as agents of female upper genital tract infection, including pelvic inflammatory disease, and the syndrome bv has been associated with adverse outcome of pregnancy, including premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and fetal loss; postpartum endometritis; cuff cellulitis; and urinary tract infections. the mechanisms by which the bv-associated flora causes  the signs of bv are not well understood, but a role for h2o2-producing lactobacillus spp. in protecting against colonization by catalase-negative anaerobic bacteria has been recognized. these and other aspects of bv are reviewed.
