TI  - Effects of preincubation temperature on the detection of fastidious organisms in  delayed-entry samples in the BacT/ALERT 3D blood culture system.
AB  - This study evaluates the effect of preincubation on delayed-entry samples for fastidious organisms including the HACEK group, Streptococcus species, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus species and Corynebacterium species for the BacT/ALERT 3D System (bioMerieux) using the FA (aerobic) medium. Bottles were inoculated with two different concentrations (0.5 McFarland and a 1:100,000 dilution) of each organism and either loaded into the system immediately or stored at 4 degrees C, room temperature (RT) or 37 degrees C for 24 hours (h) prior to loading. The detection rate (DR) was 92.5% for bottles loaded immediately for both concentrations with a mean time to detection (TTD) of 26.7 h (standard deviation (SD): 14.7 h) for the low concentration and 9.21 h (SD: 5.3 h) for the high concentration. Preincubation at 4 degrees C did not affect the DR for either of the two concentrations in comparison to no preincubation. The DR at RT was 90.0% for the low concentration and 83.6% for the high concentration. At 37 degrees C the DR was 76.3% and 66.3% for the low and the high concentrations respectively. The average TTD was inversely correlated with the preincubation temperature. An incubation of four days was sufficient, with the exception of Eikenella corrodens and Gemella sanguinis. The serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis did not influence the TTD. Kingella kingae remained undetected. For the retrieval of the above mentioned bacteria we recommend storage of bottles at room temperature. In case of erroneous storage at 37 degrees C subcultivation is advisable. All cases with a negative result on day four should be reevaluated and eventually new material for alternative diagnostic procedures should be retrieved.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in atheromatous plaques by quantitative PCR.
AB  - This is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial DNA from ten species, including periodontal species and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We examined 129 samples of DNA extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from ten different species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola and C. pneumoniae. All determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods employing SYBR Green. Species from the Bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. Almost half of the samples contained DNA from A. a. and C. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. S. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. The proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic DNA. The data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. We conclude that DNA from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of C. pneumoniae to the inflammation may be minimal.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  - The mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria perflava/sicca and Neisseria mucosa and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, Kingella denitrificans, M. catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, N. perflava/sicca, and N. mucosa at similar frequencies. The mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
TI  - Characterization of gram-positive tellurite resistance encoded by the Streptococcus pneumoniae tehB gene.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium which is naturally resistant to tellurite. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a homologue of the Escherichia coli tellurite resistance gene tehB from S. pneumoniae. It encoded a protein of 284 amino acids which is 86 residues longer than E. coli TehB, but similar in size to Haemophilus influenzae TehB and Eikenella corrodens hemagglutinin (Hag1) as well as homologues from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. The S. pneumoniae TehB displayed 46-58% identity (52-68% similarity) to these proteins. The results in this study showed that the S. pneumoniae tehB alone not only conferred on E. coli high level resistance to tellurite, but also caused filamentous morphology in E. coli.
TI  - Chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - In children, sinusitis is a common, generally uncomplicated, and self limiting disease which drops with age. The diagnosis is difficult because of relatively non specific signs and symptoms that overlap with viral upper respiratory infection and allergy. Plain paranasal sinus radiographs are not adequate, in determining the extent of involvement in recurrent or chronic sinusitis and so CT scan has become the standard. Viral illness appears to be the most common predisposing factor. Immune defects (mainly IG2 and IGA) may exist in a significant percentage of children. The role of allergy seems less important. With advances in the genetic field of cystic fibrosis, genetic factors are advocated in chronic or recurrent sinusitis. The most common bacterial pathogens in pediatric sinusitis patients are SP (Streptococcus Pneumoniae), HI (Hemophilus Influenza) and MC (Moraxella Catarrhalis). Other less frequent bacterial species include group A streptococcus, group C streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus, moraxella species and Eikenella corrodens. Respiratory anaerobes are not common. Antibiotics resistant to the action of the beta-lactamase are the cornerstone in medical treatment. In recurrent acute sinusitis prophylactic antimicrobials may be helpful. The indication for surgery remains controversial. To date, we have no prospective studies comparing surgical to medical therapy in order to guide us in deciding surgical indication. It is therefore recommended to follow a conservative track and to limit surgical procedures in children with suppurative complications, nasal obstruction from polyposis or refractory sinusitis aggravating chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma.
TI  - [Various new pathogens in pneumonia].
AB  - The table summarizes the many newly recognized agents causing lower respiratory tract infections: gram + cocci, Streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci; gram-rods, acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Eikenella corrodens; Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs, intracellular organisms and viruses. Some details are given in four chapters: Pneumococci resistant to penicillin G which must be detected and impose new therapeutic strategies; Chlamydia pneumoniae with its difficulties for the diagnosis and the absence of standardized therapeutic trials; Streptococcus pyogenes with a recrudescence of severe and invasive infections, TSS and virulence factors; the pulmonary Hantavirus syndrome with 105 patients recognized (mortality 52%) in the USA and Canada, the homeland of the deermouse (Peromiscus maniculatus).
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
AB  - The medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Eikenella corrodens. No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. Twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. A thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural pH and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. A scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. In patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (P less than 0.001).
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of Yersinia enterocolitica, Eikenella corrodens, and penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam and alternative antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 14 strains of Yersinia enterocolitica, 28 strains of Eikenella corrodens, 10 strains of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 10 strains of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae. Y. enterocolitica was found to be susceptible to the aminoglycosides tested and to chloramphenicol, moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime but resistant to ampicillin and variably susceptible to carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. On a weight basis, cefotaxime and moxalactam were the most active agents against E. corrodens. Most strains of E. corrodens were resistant to the aminoglycosides tested: gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was most susceptible to cefotaxime and moxalactam. Cefotaxime was consistently active against all tested strains of Y. enterocolitica, E. corrodens, and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, three unusual but clinically significant pathogens.
TI  - Some observations on the effects produced in white mice following the injection of certain suspensions of corroding bacilli.
AB  - Strictly anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic strains of "corroding bacilli" failed to produce any pathological symptoms when injected into white mice and no viable organisms could be recovered after 7 days. However, when these same strains were coupled with certain other living bacteria or certain sterile bacterial extracts, lesions developed from which corroding bacilli could be isolated even after 21 days.
