TI  - Identification and characterization of re-citrate synthase in Syntrophus aciditrophicus.
AB  - Glutamate is usually synthesized from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) via citrate, isocitrate, and 2-oxoglutarate. Genome analysis revealed that in Syntrophus aciditrophicus, the gene for Si-citrate synthase is lacking. An alternative pathway starting from the catabolic intermediate glutaconyl-CoA via 2-hydroxyglutarate could be excluded by genomic analysis. On the other hand, a putative gene (SYN_02536; NCBI gene accession no. CP000252.1) annotated as coding for isopropylmalate/citramalate/homocitrate synthase has been shown to share 49% deduced amino acid sequence identity with the gene encoding Re-citrate synthase of Clostridium kluyveri. We cloned and overexpressed this gene in Escherichia coli together with the genes encoding the chaperone GroEL. The recombinant homotetrameric enzyme with a C-terminal Strep-tag (4 x 72,892 Da) was separated from GroEL on a Strep-Tactin column by incubation with ATP, K(+), and Mg(2+). The pure Re-citrate synthase used only acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate as the substrates. As isolated, the enzyme contained stoichiometric amounts of Ca(2+) (0.9 Ca/73 kDa) but achieved higher specific activities in the presence of Mn(2+) (1.2 U/mg) or Co(2+) (2.0 U/mg). To determine the stereospecificity of the enzyme, [(14)C]citrate was enzymatically synthesized from oxaloacetate and [1-(14)C]acetyl-CoA; the subsequent cleavage by Si-citrate lyase yielded unlabeled acetate and labeled oxaloacetate, demonstrating that the enzyme is a Re-citrate synthase. The production of Re-citrate synthase by S. aciditrophicus grown axenically on crotonate was revealed by synthesis of [(14)C]citrate in a cell extract followed by stereochemical analysis. This result was supported by detection of transcripts of the Re-citrate synthase gene in axenic as well as in syntrophic cultures using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR).
TI  - Production and characterization of poly(3-hydroxypropionate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) with fully controllable structures by recombinant Escherichia coli containing an engineered pathway.
AB  - Copolyesters of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB), abbreviated as P(3HP-co-4HB), was synthesized by Escherichia coli harboring a synthetic pathway consisting of five heterologous genes including orfZ encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate-coenzyme A transferase from Clostridium kluyveri, pcs' encoding the ACS domain of tri-functional propionyl-CoA ligase (PCS) from Chloroflexus aurantiacus, dhaT and aldD encoding dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2442, and phaC1 encoding PHA synthase from Ralstonia eutropha. When grown on mixtures of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO), compositions of 4HB in microbial P(3HP-co-4HB) were controllable ranging from 12 mol% to 82 mol% depending on PDO/BDO ratios. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra clearly indicated the polymers were random copolymers of 3HP and 4HB. Their mechanical and thermal properties showed obvious changes depending on the monomer ratios. Morphologically, P(3HP-co-4HB) films only became fully transparent when monomer 4HB content was around 67 mol%. For the first time, P(3HP-co-4HB) with adjustable monomer ratios were produced and characterized.
TI  - Hyperproduction of poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) from glucose by recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(4HB)] is a strong thermoplastic biomaterial with remarkable mechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, it is generally synthesized when 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) structurally related substrates such as gamma-butyrolactone, 4-hydroxybutyrate or 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) are provided as precursor which are much more expensive than glucose. At present, high production cost is a big obstacle for large scale production of poly(4HB). RESULTS: Recombinant Escherichia coli strain was constructed to achieve hyperproduction of poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(4HB)] using glucose as a sole carbon source. An engineering pathway was established in E. coli containing genes encoding succinate degradation of Clostridium kluyveri and PHB synthase of Ralstonia eutropha. Native succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase genes sad and gabD in E. coli were both inactivated to enhance the carbon flux to poly(4HB) biosynthesis. Four PHA binding proteins (PhaP or phasins) including PhaP1, PhaP2, PhaP3 and PhaP4 from R. eutropha were heterologously expressed in the recombinant E. coli, respectively, leading to different levels of improvement in poly(4HB) production. Among them PhaP1 exhibited the highest capability for enhanced polymer synthesis. The recombinant E. coli produced 5.5 g L(-1) cell dry weight containing 35.4% poly(4HB) using glucose as a sole carbon source in a 48 h shake flask growth. In a 6-L fermentor study, 11.5 g L(-1) cell dry weight containing 68.2% poly(4HB) was obtained after 52 h of cultivation. This was the highest poly(4HB) yield using glucose as a sole carbon source reported so far. Poly(4HB) was structurally confirmed by gas chromatographic (GC) as well as (1)H and (13)C NMR studies. CONCLUSIONS: Significant level of poly(4HB) biosynthesis from glucose can be achieved in sad and gabD genes deficient strain of E. coli JM109 harboring an engineering pathway encoding succinate degradation genes and PHB synthase gene, together with expression of four PHA binding proteins PhaP or phasins, respectively. Over 68% poly(4HB) was produced in a fed-batch fermentation process, demonstrating the feasibility for enhanced poly(4HB) production using the recombinant strain for future cost effective commercial development.
TI  - Mimivirus reveals Mre11/Rad50 fusion proteins with a sporadic distribution in eukaryotes, bacteria, viruses and plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mre11/Rad50 complex and the homologous SbcD/SbcC complex in bacteria play crucial roles in the metabolism of DNA double-strand breaks, including DNA repair, genome replication, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining in cellular life forms and viruses. Here we investigated the amino acid sequence of the Mimivirus R555 gene product, originally annotated as a Rad50 homolog, and later shown to have close homologs in marine microbial metagenomes. RESULTS: Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that R555 protein sequence is constituted from the fusion of an N-terminal Mre11-like domain with a C-terminal Rad50-like domain. A systematic database search revealed twelve additional cases of Mre11/Rad50 (or SbcD/SbcC) fusions in a wide variety of unrelated organisms including unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, the megaplasmid of a bacterium associated to deep-sea hydrothermal vents (Deferribacter desulfuricans) and the plasmid of Clostridium kluyveri. We also showed that R555 homologs are abundant in the metagenomes from different aquatic environments and that they most likely belong to aquatic viruses. The observed phyletic distribution of these fusion proteins suggests their recurrent creation and lateral gene transfers across organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The existence of the fused version of protein sequences is consistent with known functional interactions between Mre11 and Rad50, and the gene fusion probably enhanced the opportunity for lateral transfer. The abundance of the Mre11/Rad50 fusion genes in viral metagenomes and their sporadic phyletic distribution in cellular organisms suggest that viruses, plasmids and transposons played a crucial role in the formation of the fusion proteins and their propagation into cellular genomes.
TI  - Production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) from unrelated carbon  sources by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - A metabolically engineered Escherichia coli has been constructed for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB-co-4HB)] from unrelated carbon sources. Genes involved in succinate degradation in Clostridium kluyveri and P(3HB) accumulation pathway of Ralstonia eutropha were co-expressed for the synthesis of the above copolyester. E. coli native succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase genes sad and gabD were both deleted for eliminating succinate formation from succinate semialdehyde, which functioned to enhance the carbon flux to 4HB biosynthesis. The metabolically engineered E. coli produced 9.4 gl(-1) cell dry weight containing 65.5% P(3HB-co-11.1 mol% 4HB) using glucose as carbon source in a 48 h shake flask growth. The presence of 1.5-2 gl(-1) alpha-ketoglutarate or 1.0 gl(-1) citrate enhanced the 4HB monomer content from 11.1% to more than 20%. In a 6l fermentor study, a 23.5 gl(-1) cell dry weight containing 62.7% P(3HB-co-12.5 mol% 4HB) was obtained after 29 h of cultivation. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the highest 4HB monomer content in P(3HB-co-4HB) produced from unrelated carbon sources.
TI  - Characterization of a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase having diaphorase activity of Clostridium kluyveri.
AB  - The Clostridium kluyveri bfmBC gene encoding a putative dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD; EC 1.8.1.4) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme rBfmBC was characterized. UV-visible absorption spectrum and thin layer chromatography analysis of rBfmBC indicated that the enzyme contained a noncovalently but tightly attached FAD molecule. rBfmBC catalyzed the oxidation of dihydrolipoamide (DLA) with NAD(+) as a specific electron acceptor, and the apparent K(m) values for DLA and NAD(+) were 0.3 and 0.5 mM respectively. In the reverse reaction, the apparent K(m) values for lipoamide and NADH were 0.42 and 0.038 mM respectively. Like other DLDs, this enzyme showed NADH dehydrogenase (diaphorase) activity with some synthetic dyes, such as 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and nitro blue tetrazolium. rBfmBC was optimally active at 40 degrees C at pH 7.0, and the enzyme maintained some activity after a 30-min incubation at 60 degrees C.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Clostridium kluyveri gene responsible for diaphorase  activity.
AB  - A small enzyme showing diaphorase activity was purified from culture supernatant  of Clostridium kluyveri and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. This sequence identified a gene (diaA) encoding a protein (DiaA) of 229 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 24,981 in the genomic DNA sequence database of C. kluyveri constructed by the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth. The predicted protein was composed of a flavin reductase-like domain and a rubredoxin-like domain from its N-terminus. The diaA gene was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in an Escherichia coli recombinant. Recombinant enzyme rDiaA showed NADH/NADPH diaphorase activity with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and nitro blue tetrazolium. The enzyme was most active at pH 8.0 at 40 degrees C. The UV-visible absorption spectrum and thin layer chromatography (TLC) analyses indicated that one rDiaA molecule contained a tightly bound FMN molecule as a prosthetic group. An iron molecule was also detected in an enzyme molecule.
TI  - [Construction of recombinant Escherichia coli strains producing poly (4-hydroxybutyric acid) homopolyester from glucose].
AB  - The aim of this study is to construct recombinant Escherichia coli strains capable of producing poly(4-hydroxybutyric acid) homopolyester from glucose as sole carbon source. A glutamate: succinate semialdehyde transaminase gene from Escherichia coli, a glutamate decarboxylase gene from E. coli, and a 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase gene from Ralstonia eutropha were cloned by PCR and assembled onto the plasmid pKSSE5.3 which haboured the PHA synthase gene from Ralstonia eutropha and 4-hydroxybutyrate: CoA transferase from Clostridium kluyveri. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli and the pathway for biosynthesis of poly(4-hydroxybutyric acid) from glucose via alpha-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in TCA cycle was established in recombinant E. coli strains. Recombinant strains synthesized the homopolyester P(4HB), when cells were cultivated in Luria-Bertani broth with glucose as carbon source. P(4HB) accumulation was enhanced up to 30% of cell dry weight, when cells were cultivated in mineral salts M9 medium plus glucose as sole carbon source with addition of yeast extract, tryptone, casein hydrolate into medium respectively.
TI  - Fermentation of 4-aminobutyrate by Clostridium aminobutyricum: cloning of two genes involved in the formation and dehydration of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.
AB  - Clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA to acetate and butyrate. The genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfD (4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase), abfT (4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase), and abfH (NAD-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). The genes abfD and abfT were cloned, sequenced and expressed as active enzymes in Escherichia coli. Hence the insertion of the [4Fe-4S]clusters and FAD into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from C. aminobutyricum. The amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the CoA-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of Clostridium difficile, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. In addition the N-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those of a family of FAD-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. The putative assignment in the databank of Cat2 (OrfZ) from Clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with AbfT (57% identity). Furthermore, an acetyl-CoA:4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of C. kluyveri. In contrast to glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive EXG, which is conserved in many homologues of AbfT, does not form a CoA-ester during catalysis.
TI  - Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) formation from gamma-aminobutyrate and glutamate.
AB  - To provide 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)  formation from glutamate in Escherichia coli, an acetyl-CoA:4-hydroxybutyrate CoA transferase from Clostridium kluyveri, a 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha, a gamma-aminobutyrate:2-ketoglutarate transaminase from Escherichia coli, and glutamate decarboxylases from Arabidopsis thaliana or E. coli were cloned and functionality tested by expression of single genes in E. coli to verify enzymatic activity, and uniquely assembled as operons under the control of the lac promoter. These operons were independently transformed into E. coli CT101 harboring the runaway replication vector pJM9238 for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production. Plasmid pJM9238 contains the PHA biosynthetic operon of R. eutropha under tac promoter control. Polyhydroxyalkanoate formation was monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis of the chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated polyesters. Functionality of the biosynthetic pathway for copolymer production was demonstrated through feeding experiments using various carbon sources that supplied different precursors within the 4HB-CoA biosynthetic pathway.
TI  - Identification of cysteine and arginine residues essential for the phosphotransacetylase from Methanosarcina thermophila.
AB  - Phosphotransacetylase catalyzes the following reaction: CoASH + CH3CO2PO3(2-) <==> CH3COSCoA + HPO4(2-) (where CoA is coenzyme A). Based on biochemical characterization of the enzyme from the obligate anaerobe Clostridium kluyveri, a ternary mechanism was proposed in which an unspecified cysteine abstracts a proton from CoASH forming a nucleophilic thiolate anion which attacks acetyl phosphate (J. Henkin and R. H. Abeles, Biochemistry 15:3472-3479, 1976). Heterologous production in Escherichia coli of the phosphotransacetylase from Methanosarcina thermophila, an obligately anaerobic methanoarchaeon, allowed site-specific replacements to identify essential residues. All four cysteines present in the sequence were individually replaced with alanine, and the kinetic constants of the altered enzymes were determined. The results indicated that only C159 is essential for activity; however, replacement with serine resulted in a fully active enzyme. Activity of the unaltered phosphotransacetylase was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. Inhibition kinetics of altered enzymes indicated that this sensitivity resulted from modification of C312, which is at the active site but itself is nonessential for catalysis. Five arginines were individually replaced with glutamine. Kinetic analysis of the altered enzymes identified R310 as essential for activity. Of the four nonessential for activity, R87 and R133 appear to be involved in binding CoA.
TI  - Production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) in recombinant Escherichia coli grown on glucose.
AB  - A recombinant Escherichia coli strain has been developed that produces poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) when grown in complex medium containing glucose. This has been accomplished by introducing into E. coli DH5 alpha separate plasmids harboring the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis genes from Ralstonia eutropha (formerly named Alcaligenes eutrophus) and the succinate degradation genes from Clostridium kluyveri, respectively. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) levels reached 50% of the cell dry weight and contained up to 2.8 mol.% 4-hydroxybutyrate. The molecular weight of the polymer was 1.8 x 10(6).
TI  - Biosynthesis of poly(4-hydroxybutyric acid) by recombinant strains of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The aim of this study was the production of the homopolyester poly(4-hydroxybutyric acid) (poly(4HB)) with recombinant strains of Escherichia coli. Wild-type strains and other widely used non-recombinant strains of E. coli are not able to produce polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHA) as storage compounds and cannot utilize 4-hydroxybutyric acid as sole carbon source. Accordingly, hybrid plasmids of pBluescript vectors were constructed which harbored the Alcaligenes eutrophus PHA synthase gene (phaC) and the Clostridium kluyveri orfZ putatively encoding a 4-hydroxybutyric acid-coenzyme A transferase. A 3.5-kb genomic SmaI/ApaI fragment from A. eutrophus, which comprises phaC, and a 1.8-kb genomic ApaI/EcoRI fragment from C kluyveri, which contained orfZ, were inserted into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of the vectors pKS- and pSK-, respectively. The two resulting plasmids pSKSE5.3 and pKSSE5.3 comprising phaC and orfZ colinear or antilinear to lacZ, respectively, were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue. Recombinant strains synthesized the homopolyester poly(4HB), when the cells were cultivated in Luria-Bertani broth and if glucose and 4-hydroxybutyric acid were provided as carbon sources. If glucose was omitted, a copolyester of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and 4-hydroxybutyric acid was accumulated. The homopolyester poly(4HB) was also accumulated during cultivation of these strains in M9 mineral salts medium containing glucose plus 4-hydroxybutyric acid as carbon sources. Poly(4HB) could amount up to approximately 80% (w/w) of the cell dry matter if E. coli XL1-Blue harboring pKSSE5.3 was cultivated in M9 mineral salts medium and if the cultures were not sufficiently supplied with oxygen. 4HB was also incorporated into PHA if gamma-butyrolactone was used as carbon source. If levulinic acid, 4-hydroxyvaleric acid or gamma-valerolactone were used as carbon sources, only very low amounts of PHA were accumulated which did not contain 4-hydroxyalkanoic acids as constituents.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the anaerobic succinate degradation pathway in Clostridium  kluyveri.
AB  - A region of genomic DNA from Clostridium kluyveri was cloned in Escherichia coli  by a screening strategy which was based on heterologous expression of the clostridial 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase gene. The gene region (6,575 bp) contained several open reading frames which encoded the coenzyme A (CoA)- and NADP+-dependent succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (sucD), the 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (4hbD), and a succinyl-CoA;CoA transferase (cat1), as analyzed by heterologous expression in E. coli. An open reading frame encoding a putative membrane protein (orfY) and the 5' region of a gene encoding a sigma 54-homologous sigma factor (sigL) were identified as well. Transcription was investigated by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. Protein sequence comparisons of SucD and 4HbD revealed similarities to the adhE (aad) gene products from E. coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum and to enzymes of the novel class (III) of alcohol dehydrogenases. A comparison of CoA-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases is presented.
TI  - FAD is covalently attached to peptidyl-tRNA during cell-free synthesis of 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase.
AB  - The process, by which FAD is attached covalently to the 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase apoprotein in D-nicotine-induced cells of Arthrobacter oxidans was studied in vitro. [3H]Adenine-labelled FAD prepared biosynthetically in Clostridium kluyveri was incorporated into the 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase molecule during cell-free translation. FAD rather than FMN or riboflavin was thus shown to be the flavin derivative transferred to the polypeptide chain. After short-term protein synthesis on ribosomes from induced A. oxidans cells in the presence of an Escherichia coli MRE 600 supernatant fraction and [adenine-2-3H]FAD, THE PEPTIDYL-TRNA fraction was separated from completed polypeptides. Labelled FAD was found to be covalently attached to the tRNA-bound polypeptides. Cleavage of the tRNA-peptide bond released labelled polypeptides the largest of which migrated as authentic 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase during dodecylsulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results strongly suggest that FAD is incorporated into the nascent polypeptide chains of 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase during ribosomal translation.
